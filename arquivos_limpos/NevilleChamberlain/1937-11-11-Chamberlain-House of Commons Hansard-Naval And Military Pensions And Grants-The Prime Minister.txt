I do not think that this is a case for an arrangement through the usual channels because it is open to the Leader of the Opposition to put down any subject he likes for discussion on Supply. Of course, there are other opportunities for discussion if hon. Gentlemen desire them.
I do not think that the time has come at present for the appointment of a Select Committee. I understand that there is an investigation proceeding by the British Legion, and it might be well to wait and see what they have to report.
The Motion cannot be discussed, but the subject can be discussed on the salary of the Minister of Pensions.
Before indignation is created in the public mind, it would be as well to have the facts, and the British Legion are in a particularly favourable position to get them.
