I intervene in response to the appeals that have been made to me by several hon. Members as to what exactly my position is on this matter. My hon. Friend has very frankly and fully expressed to the House his regret that, being fresh to responsibility, he has committed an indiscretion. He has made a speech about foreign affairs, and not being a Member of the Cabinet, he is not, of course, a party to the Government's policy until it is declared. Undoubtedly, my hon. Friend would have been better advised if he had been more careful in the language he used, especially at a moment of some delicacy. I am satisfied that my hon. Friend had in his mind no sinister object, that he committed an indiscretion, an error of judgment, and nothing more, and I am satisfied to leave it at that.
I have already explained the position.
