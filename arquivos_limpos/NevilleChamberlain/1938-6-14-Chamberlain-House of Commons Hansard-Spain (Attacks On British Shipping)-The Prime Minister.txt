I think the statement which I have made will show that His Majesty's Government have considered all possible alternatives—
—and that we are by no means acquiescing.
The suggestion of the right hon. Gentleman that the import of anti-aircraft guns should be allowed to the Spanish Government appears to be contrary to the Government's policy of non-intervention.
The answer to that question is that General Franco is entirely responsible for the forces which acknowledge his command.
British ships, all of them, I think, have observers on board. I do not think it is necessary to have observers on board in order to say that any such bombing is in our opinion unjustifiable.
I have explained the reasons.
I have said that I do not think any action which we can take is practicable to stop these attacks. If my hon. Friend has a practicable suggestion to make I shall be glad to consider it.
We have considered that also, but do not consider it to be practicable.
As I have said, for this action there is no precedent. There is no precedent for these attacks from the air, because aircraft were not previously developed. It gives rise to a series of new problems, as to which previous experience is not available.
I have already answered that question.
You can prevent a ship going into a port but you cannot prevent an aeroplane coming over.
I do not think that that is likely to be the effect of it. If the hon. Member will consider the statement that I read, and particularly the last part of it, he will see that it contained a warning.
I do not think we agreed to or approved of anything of the kind.
