:The changes in the control of the British Broadcasting Corporation have been of two kinds. First, the powers held by the Postmaster-General under the existing Charter and Licence, other than powers relating to technical matters affecting wireless traffic, have been transferred to the Ministry of Information. This transfer does not alter in any way the relations between the Government and the cor-  poration. The second change is the reduction of the number of governors, announced last night, from seven to two. This reduction was made in order to insure the smooth and swift operation of the broadcasting system under war conditions. Provision for such a change in numbers is contained in the Charter, and the change was made in accordance with an agreement reached between the Government and the Board of Governors before the outbreak of war. The new arrangements do not alter the structure or constitution of the corporation and the interests of listeners and accepted principles of broadcasting policy will be fully safeguarded. In respect of censorship and news, the corporation are in the same position as the Press.
