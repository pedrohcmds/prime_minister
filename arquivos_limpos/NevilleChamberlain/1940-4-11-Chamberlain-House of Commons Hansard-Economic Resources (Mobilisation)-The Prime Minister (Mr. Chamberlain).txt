I think that the hon. Member is overlooking completely the machinery that has been set up for the co-ordination of the economic war efforts of the Allies. The general nature of these arrangements was announced after the meeting of the Supreme War Council on 17th November last: they have since been extended and improved in many directions. All this machinery is functioning with great success and I cannot see how any better super-national organisation could be devised. As regards economic co-operation with the Empire, close liaison is constantly maintained through the regular established channels, as well as by special missions where desirable. There is also a direct contact between the Economic Departments of the British and French Colonial Offices, and matters of common interest are under constant discussion between them. I would add that His Majesty's Government make it their constant endeavour to cultivate the closest possible economic relations with all friendly nations. As regards the last part of the Question, I am not in a position to add to statements made on behalf of His Majesty's Government in recent Debates in this House.
