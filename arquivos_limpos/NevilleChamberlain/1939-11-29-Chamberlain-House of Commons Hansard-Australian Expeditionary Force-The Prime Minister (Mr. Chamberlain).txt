Yes, Sir. The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia has announced that a division, which has been raised in Australia, will be sent overseas as soon as a suitable stage of training is reached, probably early in the New Year. The House will, I am confident, agree with me when I say how warmly we welcome this further evidence of Australia's resolution to put forth her full effort in the common cause.
