I am aware that this is a question which has been raised from time to time over a considerable number of years. The matter has been carefully examined in the Scottish Office I understand, and the result of that examination is that, as at present advised, there is not sufficient ground for the appointment of a Royal Commission. But as I have said to the hon. Member, I myself have read the memorandum in question, and I recognise that there are important matters raised in it which will be kept under consideration.
That is not excluded.
