If certain maximum numbers were made clear, surely the right hon. Gentleman could say whether or not his party would or would not favour the abolition of conscription?
I am very glad to support this proposed new Clause. Those of us who strongly disapprove of the Bill are, nevertheless, seeking to improve its provisions in any way that may be possible, and make them less harmful. The human factor which we are now considering is one of extreme importance. For a number of hours we have been considering purely military mattersâ€”manpower and the economic situation of the country. Very little has been heard of the human side. Hon. Members in all parts of the Committee have their obligations and responsibilities in this connection. After all, we are here to speak for the fathers and mothers of these young boys in this matter.
