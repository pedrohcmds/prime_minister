Yes, Sir. My attention has been called to the subject matter of the right hon. Gentleman's question. Unfortunately, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air was called away on urgent business affecting the work of his Department: otherwise, he would have been in his place. It has always been, and will continue to be, my practice that, as far as circumstances permit, Cabinet Ministers should be present during Debates in this House.
