The full text of the new constitution for Albania is not yet available, but an agreement has been signed by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Italy and Albania under which the international relations of Italy and Albania are to be unified and centred in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rome. In consequence of this agreement, the Albanian Minister for Foreign Affairs has addressed a circular to the heads of foreign missions in Albania, informing them that the Albanian Ministry for Foreign Affairs is to be closed and that it will therefore no longer be possible to accord to foreign representatives the privileges and immunities previously granted to them. In the circumstances His Majesty's Representative will cease to have the title of Minister, but will continue as Consul-Generalâ€”a rank which he already holds. No question of any new appointment, therefore, arises at present.
