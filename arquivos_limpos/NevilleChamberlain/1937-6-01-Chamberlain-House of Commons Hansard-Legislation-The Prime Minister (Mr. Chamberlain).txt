It was the desire and intention of His Majesty's Government that the legislation necessary to give effect to their proposals for the unification of coal royalties under public control should be introduced and carried into law during the present Session of Parliament. The House will remember that on 26th April, in announcing the Government's acceptance of the findings of the tribunal on the global purchase price of the royalties, the Prime Minister said that it was the intention to introduce the necessary legislation as soon as possible. It has, however, unfortunately become clear that the state of Parliamentary business will not permit of the passage of this Measure, which will inevitably be lengthy and complicated, during the present Session.
