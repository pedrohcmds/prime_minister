In regard to the date of the conclusion of the agreement, I understand that my right hon. Friend hopes to be able to make a statement on the subject next week. In regard to the second part of the right hon. Gentleman's Supplementary Question, of course it is a matter of greatest importance, and if the House wishes to discuss it, it will, of course, have an opportunity. I think discussion will be better after the White Paper is published.
If the House after seeing the agreement is of the opinion it was such that it should not be confirmed by the House, that would upset it.
It would make it more difficult, but I do not think the course the right hon. Gentleman suggests would be more convenient in the long run.
