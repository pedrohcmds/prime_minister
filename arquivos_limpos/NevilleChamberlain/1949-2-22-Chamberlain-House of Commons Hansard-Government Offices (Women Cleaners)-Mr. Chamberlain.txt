asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, in view of the Government's decision to award salary increases up to an additional Â£24 a week to civil servants already in receipt of four-figure incomes, he will now arrange for a review of the award of one farthing an hour increase to cleaners in Government offices.
If my right hon. and learned Friend is not taking any immediate steps in the matter of the farthing, could he not agree that these other increases are quite at variance with the spirit of the White Paper on Incomes of a year ago? Is it not also at variance with the spirit of equity and the Socialist principles which he and I profess?
