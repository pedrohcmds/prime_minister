The status of the Suez Canal cannot be altered without the consent of the parties to the Suez Canal Convention of 1888 and of Egypt. I would further remind the hon. Member that as part of the agreement signed on 16th April last, His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government reaffirmed their intention always to respect and abide by the provisions of the Convention of 1888 as it is at present in force, and that they communicated this declaration to the Egyptian Government.
