The question of formal consultation does not arise, as the other Governments of the Commonwealth were not parties to the Agreement. In accordance with established practice, Commonwealth Governments were kept closely and continuously informed on developments in connection with the negotiation of the Economic Co-operation Agreement, and thus had opportunity to express their views. No representations have been received from any of the Commonwealth Governments.
I have already pointed out to the hon. Member that they were kept closely informed. Consultation is a different matter. The fact is, they were not directly concerned in this particular Agreement.
No, Sir, no representations were made.
