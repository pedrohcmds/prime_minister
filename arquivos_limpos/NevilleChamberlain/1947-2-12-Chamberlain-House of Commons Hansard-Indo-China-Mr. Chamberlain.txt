Is my right hon. Friend aware that the statement issued at the end of M. Blum's visit did make a wider reference to the need for the preservation of peace and security in the general sense, and is he aware that many of us are extremely concerned at this recrudescence of Imperialism on the part of France? [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] Will he bear in mind that we are not only a Socialist Party, but an international Socialist Party?
In view of the unsatisfactory nature of that reply, I beg to give notice that I shall raise this matter as soon as possible on the Adjournment.
