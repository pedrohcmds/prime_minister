The hon. and gallant Gentleman began by saying that he was not concerned with personalities and was going to confine himself to the specific question of the Secretary of State, as a Member of another place. The greater part of his speech was concerned with personal attacks upon my Noble Friend, upon his predecessor, upon my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Air and upon myself. But, however inconsistent the hon. and gallant Member's speech was with the introduction with which he prefaced it, I am going to reply upon that which he proclaimed, but did not carry out, as the principal motive of his observations. The hon. and gallant Member said that he had pressed this question many times before, but I seem to think that he may be a recent convert to the view that it is necessary that the Secretary of State should be a Member of this House.
