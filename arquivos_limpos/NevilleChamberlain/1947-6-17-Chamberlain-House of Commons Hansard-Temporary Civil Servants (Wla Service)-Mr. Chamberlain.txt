Is the Chancellor aware that the agreed report of the Whitley Council on redundancy of temporary staff decided that those men and women who had been in the Forces should have their complete service with  their temporary service, and is it not, therefore, entirely a Treasury decision which has eliminated the Women's Land Army, and does he not think that this additional disability is extremely hard?
May I repeat the second part of my supplementary question, and ask the Chancellor whether that decision did not refer to men and women in the Services, so that it was a Treasury decision and not a Whitley Council decision that the Women's Land Army should be left out?
