I rise to associate my friends of the Opposition and myself with the Motion which the Prime Minister has moved so felicitously. We in this House are deeply indebted to those who serve us, and among those servants there is none who has given greater and longer service than Sir Horace Dawkins and who has been more acceptable to all Members of the House. I think that he has been a friend to every Member, and we shall miss him very much from his place. Periodically we have those eruptions called General Elections, when old faces disappear from the House and Members change their positions, but the Clerks at the Table go on and give stability to our proceedings. Now we shall look up and we shall miss his presence, but I am sure that in his retirement he will be watching over us. We all trust that his years of retirement may be long and blessed with good health and happiness.
