We have known for a long time that the hon. Member likes to pose as the enfant terrible of this House. His sense of humour is extensive and peculiar. He indulges it by endeavouring to stir up mischief, if possible, with other countries with whom he ostensibly desires that this country should retain friendship. In the present case he is hardly as innocent as he has made out. He tells us that no responsible journalist would ever dare to say in any paragraph purporting to give official in-  formation: "This cannot be denied" or "This represents exactly the views of official bodies." I must say that he has had very little experience of the manners and methods of journalists if he can really believe that.
