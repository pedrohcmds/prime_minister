(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he can now make a statement on the subject of coal legislation?
The difficulty is that there was a change in the plans of the Government owing to the Bill having been introduced by the President of the Board of Trade, emasculated and then withdrawn. What we want to know is whether the legislation is to fulfil the original programme of the Government in respect of the reorganisation of this industry.
