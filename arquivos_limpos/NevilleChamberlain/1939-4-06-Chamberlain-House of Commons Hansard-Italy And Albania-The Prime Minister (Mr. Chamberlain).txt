On 4th April His Majesty's Ambassador at Rome drew the attention of the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs to rumours similar to those referred to by the hon. and learned Member. The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that on 8th March the King of Albania had himself suggested that the existing Treaty of Alliance between Italy and Albania should be strengthened. Discussions on that point have since been taking place between the two Governments; it appears however  that in the course of these negotiations certain difficulties have arisen, the nature of which is not quite plain, and according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs Italian interests have been threatened. I have just learnt that an Italian cruiser and two smaller warships arrived at Durazzo early this morning. I have not yet received a detailed account of the point of view of the Albanian Government, but I have just received from that Government a denial of any report that they have accepted conditions incompatible with Albanian sovereignty and national integrity. His Majesty's. Minister at Darazzo has reported that all was quiet there up to 8.25 a.m. to-day. His Majesty's Government are, of course, closely watching all developments.
