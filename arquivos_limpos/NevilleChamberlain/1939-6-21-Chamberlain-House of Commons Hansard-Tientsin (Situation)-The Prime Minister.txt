Yes, Sir, we have had such reports.
The matter has been taken up, as I said in my answer.
Yes, it does. We hope they will formulate any grievances.
I have already stated, in answer to my right hon. Friend, that our Ambassador in Tokyo has made it quite clear to the Japanese Government that we cannot acquiesce in the blockade.
Yes, Sir, the matter has been under constant examination.
The whole position is being considered. But the question  arises as to where the food is to come from.
No, Sir.
We must come to an agreement first.
Obviously.
