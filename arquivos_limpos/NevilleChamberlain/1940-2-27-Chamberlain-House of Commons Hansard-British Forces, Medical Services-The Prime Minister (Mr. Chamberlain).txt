While it is true that the sudden increase in the size of the Forces, their wide distribution, and necessary movements have caused difficulties in regard to medical arrangements, and these difficulties have been accentuated by the recent influenza epidemic, the Departments concerned are doing their utmost to remedy any deficiencies. All complaints and criticisms which have been received have been promptly and carefully investigated,  though many have been found to be inaccurate and exaggerated. I do not think, therefore, that investigation by a. Committee of this House, or any special report, is required, and I would add that the suggestion that the health of the troops has been allowed to suffer through a policy of hardening them cannot be too strongly repudiated.
