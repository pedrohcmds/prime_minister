As regards the first and second parts of the Question, I would refer the hon. Member to the reply given to-day to his Question No. 12 addressed to my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade. In reply to the last part of the Question, I would refer him to the answer given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 4th July to the hon. and  learned Member for Greenock (Mr. R. Gibson). I do not think that any additional machinery is necessary.
