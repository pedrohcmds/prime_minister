For the bulk of his work the Lord Privy Seal will rely upon the services of the organisation which has hitherto served my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department. This organisation has, by mutual arrangement, been placed at his disposal, and it will be adjusted and expanded as experience may show to be necessary. In addition, the Lord Privy Seal is assembling a special staff, mainly for co-ordination purposes. As regards the last part of the question, I have consulted Mr. Speaker, and it has been arranged that the Lord Privy Seal should answer questions on Thursdays. Questions addressed to my right hon. Friend will, therefore, appear third on the Paper, immediately after questions addressed to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. This, I think, will be a convenient arrangement.
