Yes, Sir, certainly. I appreciate that the situation can be solved only by an increase in the amount of coal borne by sea. It can be assisted by land transport, but it is essential to get further supplies by sea. Therefore I will give my personal attention to the point to which the hon. Gentleman has referred.
I thank my Noble Friend for her care for me, but I have every confidence in my Ministers—[Hon. Members: "The King's Ministers"]—I should say, in my colleagues. I was asked by the Leader of the Opposition to take a personal interest in the matter, and to that request I am very glad to accede.
That is a matter which will have attention.
Yes, Sir.
A Question on that subject has been answered to-day.
When we have solved the problem of transport, the other problems will very speedily be on the way to a solution.
