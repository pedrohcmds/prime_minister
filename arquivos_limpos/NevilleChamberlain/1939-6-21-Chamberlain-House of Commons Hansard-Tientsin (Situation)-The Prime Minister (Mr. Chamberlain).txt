Barrier restrictions have remained the same. Four British subjects have been stripped and searched, but no further incidents are reported in the latest telegram received from His Majesty's Consul-General. It was announced by the Japanese News Agency that the barbed wire encircling the British and French Concessions would be electrically charged from the late evening of 19th June. As regards stocks of food, there are ample supplies of flour and rice in the British Concession; arrivals of perishable foodstuffs remain spasmodic and far below normal. There would appear to be no ban on foodstuffs entering the Concession, but the Japanese authorities claim that all such commodities as vegetables have to be searched at the barriers and this causes considerable delay. As regards shipping, matters have considerably improved, and ships using the river have latterly not been stopped by the Japanese military authorities.
