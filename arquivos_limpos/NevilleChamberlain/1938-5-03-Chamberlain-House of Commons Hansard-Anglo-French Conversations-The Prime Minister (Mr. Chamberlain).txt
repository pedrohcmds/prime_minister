My Noble Friend and myself were glad to have an opportunity of reviewing with the French President of the Council, M. Daladier, and the French Foreign Minister, M. Bonnet, the various international questions which are a matter of preoccupation at the present time. The conversations have been of value in helping each Government to obtain a closer understanding of the other's point of view, and in demonstrating once again the community of outlook and interest which unites them. The results of the meetings have been set out in the official statement issued on 29th April at the conclusion of the conversations, the text of which I am circulating in the OFFICIAL REPORT.
