I am not at present in a position to add to the reply given by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 29th November to the hon. Member for Kingswinford (Mr. A. Henderson), namely, that M. Van Zeeland is preparing his report, but it has not yet been received. As regard the second part of the question, I shall be ready to consider the question of a public statement when the report has been received.
