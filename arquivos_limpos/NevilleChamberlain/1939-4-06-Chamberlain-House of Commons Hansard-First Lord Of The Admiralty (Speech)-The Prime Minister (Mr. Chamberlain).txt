The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) began by making a very courteous reference to myself for which I am much obliged to him. I would like to say that, so far from making any complaint of having to appear here again to say a few words on this subject, I welcome the opportunity of supplementing what I said before. The hon. Member mentioned three definite points in the course of his speech, one of which was emphasised by the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kingswinford (Mr. A. Henderson). The first, and perhaps the most important point, was the question of the issue of the D notice, the second was the propriety of my action in interfering at all, and the third was my use of the words "as reported" in answer to a supplementary question. As to the last one—and perhaps I may deal with it first as it is a small matter—the words were used, as the hon. Member observed, in answer to a supplementary question, and, therefore, they were not considered words, but they did give rise, I think, to a natural misunderstanding.
