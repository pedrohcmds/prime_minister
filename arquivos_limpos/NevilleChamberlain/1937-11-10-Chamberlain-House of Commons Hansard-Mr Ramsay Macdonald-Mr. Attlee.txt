I would like, on behalf of all my friends on these Benches and of myself, to express our sincere sympathy with the family of Mr. MacDonald in the great loss which has suddenly come upon them. I know how close were the bonds  of affection between members of that family, and I recall also at this time the gracious personality of the wife and helpmeet of whom he wrote that famous memorial. This House also has sustained a great loss in the death of one of its most distinguished Members. He was a great Parliamentary figure who had been for the greater part of 30 years prominent in our Debates, a man who held for more than seven years the high office of the first Minister of the Crown.
