Parcels for British civilians interned in Germany may be sent through the intermediary of the Prisoners of War Department of the War Organisation of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John of Jerusalem. The arrangements for packing and despatching parcels are similar to those described by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for War, in answer to a question on 5th December in regard to prisoners of war. Instructions for the guidance of relatives and others desiring to send parcels have been drawn up by the Prisoners of War Department and have been sent to persons interested in the welfare of interned civilians. A number of parcels of food and clothing have already been despatched by the Department, and further parcels are now being sent regularly to all known internees.
