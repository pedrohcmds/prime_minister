(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he will state the grounds for making the recent changes in the control of the British Broadcasting Corporation?
Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that this House has always been very jealous of the position of the British Broadcasting Corporation and does desire that there should be a proper representation of general public opinion on the Board of Governors, and that there is very grave dissatisfaction at present with the B.B.C.? Is it not very undesirable that the more independent members of the board should have been removed and that, without casting any reflection on those remaining, they are, as a matter of fact, those with the most official outlook; and is the right hon. Gentleman aware that there is a fear that in fact the B.B.C. have now become part of a bureaucratic machine at a time when it should be most closely in touch with public opinion?
The question is not one between the Governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Government, but between this House and the public and the Government, because it is the rights of the general public which are being signed away. May 1 ask why, in view of the fact that it requires 999 employes at the Ministry of Information, together with Advisory Committees, in order to deal with that Department, it is necessary to take away the only public contact we have with the B.B.C?
May I ask the Prime Minister whether he proposes to make any similar changes with regard to the Ministry of Information in order to get things done more quickly?
Will the Prime Minister be prepared to reconsider this decision to take away any of the Governors who are most likely to be in touch with the public?
I beg to give notice that on an early occasion I shall raise this matter, which is of vital importance to the nation.
