His Majesty's Government have recently given attention to the question whether a further development of present methods of publicity during peace time is required. It is not their intention to set up a Ministry of Information or Propaganda, which in their opinion is not what is re-  quired at the present time. The House is aware that a great deal of valuable work is already being done in spreading a knowledge of this country through the cultural and educational work of the British Council, in disseminating accurate information and counteracting foreign misrepresentation of British policy and action by the B.B.C. in their foreign language broadcasts and by the Press. The Foreign Office maintains the necessary contacts with all these channels of publicity. There is reason to suppose that these efforts have been a good deal more effective than is generally realised, but the Government is of opinion that their effectiveness could be considerably strengthened if their direction were co-ordinated and concentrated in a special department of the Foreign Office.
