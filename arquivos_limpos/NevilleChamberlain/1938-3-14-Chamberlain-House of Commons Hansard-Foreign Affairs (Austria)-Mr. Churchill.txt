He did not mention it.
There were a good many things in the speech of the hon. Lady the Member for Jarrow (Miss Wilkinson) with which I felt myself in much more cordial agreement than some of my neighbours did. There were other things in her speech with which I found myself much less in agreement. But I do not propose to trench upon any of the controversial or party or recriminatory grounds which enter into many people's minds, and which might well be exploited upon suitable occasions but seem inappropriate to the grave circumstances in which this Debate is held. The speech of the Prime Minister overshadowed the Debate and dominates all our minds. I do not know when in my lengthening experience of the House of Commons I have heard—certainly not since the War—a statement so momentous, expressed in language of rigid restraint but giving the feeling of iron determination behind it.
Will my hon. Friend say what he means by "eventually reconstructed"?
The Prime Minister said "hasty decisions" not "rapid decisions."
