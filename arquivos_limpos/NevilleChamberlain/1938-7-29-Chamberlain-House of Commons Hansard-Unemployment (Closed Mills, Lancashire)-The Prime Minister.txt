Reports continually come to us from the Departments concerned, and we get full information as to the conditions of employment throughout the country.
I should not like to reply to that in the affirmative, because it might rouse hopes which could not be fulfilled. The opinion of His Majesty's Government is that the emergency work which has been put in hand for the purpose of dealing with unemployment has not proved in the past effective. The number of people who can be dealt with in that way is exceedingly small in proportion to the cost. There are several other ways in which something may be done to mitigate the fluctuations in trade, and I can assure the hon. Member that the Government have them very closely in mind all the time.
The hon. Baronet knows that the Government have throughout done their very best to direct expenditure  upon armaments to those areas where unemployment is most prevalent. We have, indeed, on numerous occasions taken action in cases where, if we had considered simply the desirability of getting the work out in the quickest time, we should have sent the work elsewhere, but it has been deliberately diverted to places where it was most required. There, again, I think the general question of trade is one to which we have to direct our attention. I deprecate any suggestion that we are on the edge of a slump or of a return to any such conditions as existed in 1931.
The Government are very conscious of the difficulties of Lancashire, and are anxious to do anything they can. The hon. Member has given me credit for greater powers than any wizard has ever claimed if he thinks that I can devise during the Recess some new industries to take the place of the cotton industry.
That is another question.
