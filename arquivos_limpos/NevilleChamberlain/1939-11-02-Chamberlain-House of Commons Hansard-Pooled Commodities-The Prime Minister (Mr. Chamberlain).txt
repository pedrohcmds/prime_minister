I am not sure what precise significance the hon. Member attaches to the term "pooled commodities." If he has in mind commodities which are pooled together and sold in one standard only there are two such commodities, margarine and dried fruits. The control of margarine is exercised by Mr. J. P. Van den Bergh under Mr. Herbert Davis, the Director of Oils and Fats, and the control of dried fruits by Mr. A. E. Gough. In the case of motor spirit, control is exercised by the Petroleum Board.
