asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the willingness of both President Truman and Marshal Stalin to meet, he will now offer to arrange such a meeting in London.
While appreciating that to be the situation, does my right hon. Friend not agree that the present international deadlock can now be resolved only by some top-level meeting such as has been proposed? Further, does not my right hon. Friend agree that the immediate obstacles, namely, the refusal of both Stalin and Truman to meet in each other's territories, and the desire of the President to bring Great Britain into the conference, would both be solved by the solution proposed in my Question?
Will my right hon. Friend at least bear in mind that even in this latter day a little energetic initiative might yet move mountains?
