At an earlier stage of the proceedings I said I would make a statement about business later in the day. I propose to make that statement now. Conversations have taken place through the usual channels with regard to the arrangement of business for the remainder of the week. We shall conclude the Debate on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House to-night, and a Motion with regard to Government policy will be moved to-morrow. That Debate will be resumed and concluded on Thursday. We propose that on Thursday the House should meet at 11 in the morning and  adjourn at 4 o'clock. At the beginning of business on Thursday I shall move a Motion for the Adjournment of the House until Tuesday, 1st November, and it will include the usual provision empowering Mr. Speaker to call the House together at an earlier date if the public interest so requires.
