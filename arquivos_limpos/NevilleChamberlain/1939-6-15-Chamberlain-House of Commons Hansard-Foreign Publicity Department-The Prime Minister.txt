My right hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will answer questions on the subject of the Department. As regards the second question, I do not think that any such proposal has been under consideration, as far as I am aware.
I think we had better set up the Department, and then consider it.
Yes, Sir, I tried to make it clear that the development which I had indicated for peace-time would not constitute the setting up of a new Ministry. That would be a war-time measure only. With regard to the peace-  time publicity which I have described, that would be concerned with overseas publicity entirely, and there will be no interference with the Press in this country by the Department.
Lord Perth was, of course, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and I think that in that capacity he had a great deal of experience in connection with publicity. He also has had a great number of contacts with the representatives of different foreign countries.
I do not think it is necessary to associate journalists directly with a Department of the Foreign Office. Of course, there must be intimate touch between the Department and the journalistic profession.
The work of the British Council is already controlled by the Foreign Office to some extent, and what further developments in the relation between them may be necessary will, I think, be worked out when the Department is set up.
I should think so.
