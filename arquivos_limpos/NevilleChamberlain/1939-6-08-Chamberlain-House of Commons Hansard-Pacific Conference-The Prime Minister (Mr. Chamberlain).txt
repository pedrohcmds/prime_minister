The report of the New Zealand Conference has been received, and is under consideration by His Majesty's Government. The proceedings were, from the nature of the agenda, confidential, and cannot be published. Moreover, the conclusions of the Conference are in the form of recommendations to the three Governments concerned, and it follows that no statement can be made until the Governments have had time to complete their Study of them. The Conference was very satisfactory, and afforded an opportunity for a frank interchange of views on matters of mutual concern in the Pacific.
