While emphasising that any criticism is directed towards the Minister, and in no sense towards their Royal Highnesses, may I ask the Minister two questions? First, in view of the strict economy which has been enjoined on all of us, is it right that at this time this large amount of money should be spent? Secondly, at a time when hundreds of thousands are desperately in need of homes, is it right that labour and materials should be spent on this object?
