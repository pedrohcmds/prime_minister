Surely that is not the only effect of this Amendment? It has been conclusively shown here that the effect is also to reduce to a mere £1 million the effect of the whole tax.
Or whisky?
The whole basis of this Bill has been fairly well discussed, but there are still a few things to which I wish to call attention, although I do not wish to detain the Committee long. I think it has been made clear by the Opposition—indeed, it was made very clear by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. R. A. Butler)—that they are bitterly opposed to the Bill and that the object of their Amendments is to wreck it, as the right hon. Gentleman in fact said. Those Members of the Opposition who have suggested that they are trying to make the Bill more balanced are overshadowed by the clear intention of the Opposition as a whole to kill the Bill.
The first Amendment dealt with a decrease in the tax on undistributed profits. The Opposition said that industry could not bear this additional burden. Surely I am in Order in advancing reasons why that is not so.
I was here throughout the Debate on that Amendment, and although it was rather wide, and hon. Members were constantly called to Order, I do not think it touched the point I am making at all. I think hon. Members will bear me out on that.
