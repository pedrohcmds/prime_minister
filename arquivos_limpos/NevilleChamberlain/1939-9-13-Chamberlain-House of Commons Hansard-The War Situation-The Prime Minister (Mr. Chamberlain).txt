The House will have learnt from the communiqu√©issued last night that the Supreme War Council met for the first time yesterday, on French soil. I think it is fitting that I should begin my progress report this week with an account of the meeting. It was attended, as the House knows, by Lord Chatfield and myself for Great Britain, and by M. Daladier and General Gamelin for France. The representatives of both countries were accompanied by a number of officials, but, as we were already in close touch with the French authorities on technical strategic questions, it was not intended to discuss such questions at the meeting, and the Chiefs of Staff were not, therefore, on this occasion summoned to attend. The object of the meeting was to make possible, at the earliest practicable stage in the war, a direct and personal exchange of views. The present situation was fully examined and the measures to be taken in the immediate future were discussed. Further meetings will be arranged as and when necessary, in order to ensure that the closest possible contact is maintained between our two countries on all major aspects of the conduct of the war.
