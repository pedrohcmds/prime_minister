The matters to which the question relates involve problems of very great difficulty. They have constantly been the subject of Government inquiries, including during recent years a Royal Commission and several Departmental Committees which have expended a great deal of time and trouble in an endeavour to carry out the objects which no doubt my hon. Friend has at heart. A number of things have been done in that direction in recent years, and, in particular, it may be mention that the County Court limit has been raised by an Act passed this year. Moreover, the questions which arise are constantly under review by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and his advisers, and, after consultation with him, I am not satisfied that the interests of the administration of justice would be served by the appointment of a Royal Commission as suggested by my hon. Friend.
