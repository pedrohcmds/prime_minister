It is not possible to give any accurate figures for the absorption of Jewish refugees in countries of refuge and settlement. In August last it was estimated by the High Commissioner of the League of Nations for Refugees that roughly 120,000 refugees from Germany of all categories had reached countries of permanent settlement. It may be assumed that several thousand more have done so in the last few months. As regards the second part of the question, the answer is in the negative, since the admission of refugees into any Dominion is a matter for the Dominion Government concerned,  but recent statements by Dominion Ministers indicate that they are fully alive to the importance and urgency of the question. With regard to the third part of the question, I would refer the hon. Member to the reply which I gave to a question by the hon. Member for Central Bradford (Mr. Leach) on 28th November.
