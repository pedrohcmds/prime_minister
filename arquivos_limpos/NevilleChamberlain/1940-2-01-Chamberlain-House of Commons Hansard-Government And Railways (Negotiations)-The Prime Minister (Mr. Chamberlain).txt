In connection with the prosecution of the war the Government is entering into a very large number of financial agreements of all kinds, and the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that it would not be practicable for the terms of such agreements, when still under negotiation, to be submitted for discussion in this House. The responsibility for such agreements must remain with the Government, although it is, of course, open to the House to debate the conditions of any arrangement, when made and published, if it wishes to do so. In the particular case to which the right hon. Gentleman refers I understand that it is the intention of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport to circulate in the form of a White Paper an outline of the agreement between the Government and the railway companies, as soon as it is finally concluded.
