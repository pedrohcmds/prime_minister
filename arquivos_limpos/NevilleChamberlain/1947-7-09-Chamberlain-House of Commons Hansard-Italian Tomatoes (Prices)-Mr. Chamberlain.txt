asked the Minister of Food whether he is aware that Italian tomatoes are being imported into this country at 2d. per pound and retailed at the maximum price of 1s. 4d. per pound; and what steps he is taking to prevent this profiteering.
May I ask the hon. Lady whether she is aware that the tomatoes were being brought here at the end of last week at between 2d. to 4d. a lb.? Whatever one may think of maximum prices when there is scarcity, it is not generally agreed that when there is a glut or a comparative glut is the time to take maximum prices off, because they at once become minimum prices?
Do I understand the hon. Lady to say that maximum prices are to be reduced?
