On 31st May, His Majesty's Government made representations to he Burgos authorities by way of protest against damage suffered by British ships in or adjacent to Spanish Government ports. In reply to these representations the Burgos authorities stated on 5th June that they deplored the loss of life that had occurred at Valencia and other ports and that it was in conflict with their policy that their aviators should single out British ships for attack. British ships were, however, liable to mingle with ships of other nationalities, and where they lay in the neighbourhood of military objectives the task of discrimination between ships and military objectives was rendered at times impossible. They were unable to renounce the use of the Air Arm inasmuch as the prolongation of the war was due to the importation of military supplies which they declared were being carried by British and other ships.
