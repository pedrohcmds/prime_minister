Yes, Sir. I am glad to say that on 9th March agreement was reached with the Italian Government on this subject. It now appears that the instructions issued by Italian authorities for some of the vessels in question to call after 1st March, in spite of our announcement of the date after which control would be exercised, was based on a misunderstanding. Recognising this misunderstanding, His Majesty's Government have agreed to release the ships which have been detained with their cargoes. On the other hand, the Italian Government have undertaken, on their side, that the remainder of the Italian coal ships now in port will leave in ballast, and no further Italian cargo steamers will be sent to those ports to load coal.
