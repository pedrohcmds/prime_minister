I was saying that we ought to know the real purpose of this tax. Is it to raise revenue? I do not think there is any shortage of internal revenue in this country. The purpose of the Budget was clearly stated to be anti-inflationary. Is this tax to curtail betting and betting tendencies? That might well have been the intention of the present Chancellor, but this move originated with his predecessor, and I cannot think that that was his purpose. In any case, thin proposal does not do that. It cannot be to reduce any kind of consumption, which was the purpose of many Budgets and proposals such as, for instance, the raising of the Tobacco Duty. This can only be an anti-inflationary proposal, and I fail to see how a small and only partially restrictive measure of this kind, even in embryo, can be an anti-inflationary measure. I should be glad if the Chancellor would state quite clearly what is the intention. I think that many of us would then, perhaps, appreciate his point of view. I reiterate that I think that the  proposal is one-sided and out of perspective; and the only proper way would be to withdraw it and have a proper and adequate measure, which I would fully support in April. I cannot see the force of rushing this in, in the one-sided way in which he has done it.
