asked the Secretary of State for the Colonies whether arrangements have been made to continue at least until the end of June the supply of essential foods, particularly bread grains and sugar, to Palestine, recently requested by the representatives in London of the United Nations Palestine Commission.
While thanking my hon. Friend for that reply, may I ask him for an assurance that, in spite of the present difficulties, His Majesty's Government will continue to do all that is possible to supply Palestine with food, so that starvation is not added to the other troubles?
