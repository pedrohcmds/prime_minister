I mentioned that the D notice was not issued, but the request was made that it should be treated as though it were a D notice. I imagine that it was thought that this was the best way of dealing with a very urgent case, and of emphasising the desirability of complying with the request, and nothing more than that. That does not alter what I have said as to the object of my action.
