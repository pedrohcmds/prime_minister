I have appointed a Departmental Committee to examine the practical aspects of the suggestion for a pension scheme for Members of Parliament, the necessary funds to be raised and maintained by personal contributions from Members (whether compulsory or voluntary) without any charge to the taxpayer, and to report to me what are the various alternatives. On receipt of this report, I propose to consult further with representative Members of Parliament on the matter.
