The hon. Member has asked me too many questions for me to be able to remember them.
He has not been deposed and Sir James Lithgow was considered to be the most fitting person and the best qualified person for the position to which he has been appointed.
There are two questions. Perhaps the hon. Member will allow me to answer the latter Question first. The question of finance, of course, will be the responsibility of the Admiralty. With regard to the first Question, the hon. Member has already forgotten what I said in my answer. If he will read it he will see that his inference is quite incorrect.
Yes, Sir; the Admiralty will be responsible for the building of these ships. When built the ships will be the property of the Government. As to the finance, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be good enough to put a Question down.
I think I must ask the hon Member to put that Question down, because I am not quite in a position to answer it.
I do not think that the hon. Member need be under any misapprehension or apprehension in the matter; but I did not want to give an answer when I was not fully equipped to do so.
I understand that he is not to get any salary.
I recognise that it is very important that there should be no suspicion that a man who is appointed to an important post under the Government should have other interests which might conflict with his duty as a servant of the Government, but I feel sure that that has been fully provided for in the present case; but, as I say, I am not fully informed of all the circumstances, and I think that the best plan would be to have a Question put down.
