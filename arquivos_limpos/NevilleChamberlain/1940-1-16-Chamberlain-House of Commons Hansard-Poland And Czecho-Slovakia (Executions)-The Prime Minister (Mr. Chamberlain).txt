The reports of executions of Poles in German-occupied Poland are, I regret to say, generally confirmed by such evidence as is available. Any estimate of numbers would be conjectural, though it seems clear that the number of victims is considerable. In those parts of Poland incorporated in the Reich, the German authorities are reliably reported to be pursuing a policy of deliberate depopulation,  and it appears that the intellectual leaders of the country in particular are being singled out. I understand that the Polish Government themselves propose shortly to publish a White Book on the subject.
