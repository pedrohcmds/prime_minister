The Minister responsible for the execution of the Groundnut Scheme described in Command 7030 is my right hon. Friend the Minister of Food. He will be responsible for the general control of the development of the scheme, including its finances, the appointment of agents and contractors, expenditure on the housing, health, welfare and education services provided for employees of the scheme, the provision of machinery, equipment, supplies and such new transport facilities as may be required, and for the disposal of the crops.  Questions which hon. Members may desire to put on such matters should therefore be addressed to him. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies will be responsible for the more general effects of the Scheme on the territories concerned, and especially for the effects on the welfare of the Colonial peoples, the connection of the scheme with wider projects of development and the relationship of the Colonial Governments concerned to its management.
That is so. I did not intend to reply to a hypothetical question.
Yes, Sir
