Does the right hon. Gentleman propose to visit Signor Mussolini before there has been a cessation of intervention in Spain and of attacks by Italian airmen on British ships?
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether that is a consideration he is bearing in mind, and whether he thinks that to promote appeasement he should visit Signor Mussolini until there has been some sign of appeasement on that side?
