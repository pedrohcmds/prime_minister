Does not the Prime Minister think it unfortunate in that case that statements should be made by a responsible Minister in the course of a Debate which are liable to arouse grave misapprehensions in the minds of the people?
Surely the Prime Minister realises now that there is some doubt about it, for he himself apparently did not know what his colleague said. Ought he not now to take the opportunity of making a statement on this matter?
I take it that the right hon. Gentleman will take an early opportunity when there is a suitable occasion to make a statement?
