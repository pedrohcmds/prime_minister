I have seen the memorandum referred to and have consulted my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. As at present advised, I am not satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into Scottish local government administration, but the views expressed by the association have been noted and a careful watch will be kept on the working of Scottish local government arrangements, particularly in their relation to central Departments and commissions.
