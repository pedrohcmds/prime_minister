(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make as to the future responsibility for merchant shipbuilding?
I had one or two Supplementaries to put after my hon. Friend had put his, in order to elucidate the exact nature of the Prime Minister's very important statement. May I be allowed to put a Supplementary Question?
Can the Prime Minister give us any further details in regard to this arrangement? Do I understand that the Board of Admiralty will be responsible for the actual building of the ships? To whom will the ships belong when they are built, and what will be the nature of the finance in this matter?
Does the Prime Minister understand that there is a feeling of disturbance in the mind of the public at the appointment of all kinds of persons who have special private interests, when it is not clear whether those gentlemen have abandoned their private interests in acting as servants of the Government or whether they are continuing to be representative both of their private interests and of the Government service?
