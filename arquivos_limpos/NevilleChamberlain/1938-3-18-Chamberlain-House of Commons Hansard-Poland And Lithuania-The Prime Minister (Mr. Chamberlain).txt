I understand that the Polish Government have delivered an ultimatum to the Lithuanian Government, including the conditions which they consider indispensable for the avoidance of future incidents, with a time-limit of 36 hours. His Majesty's Ambassador at Warsaw has pressed upon the Polish Government their hope that this question will not be used as a pretext for making wider demands. His Majesty's Government are in touch with both Governments concerned. They are not at present satisfied that the course the hon. Member suggests would be sufficiently speedy to be practicable or the best that could be adopted. They are, however, keeping close watch on developments.
