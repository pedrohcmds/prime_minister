I desire to support the Motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister in such fitting terms and to join, on behalf of the Opposition, in offering our sympathy to His Majesty and the Royal Family on their bereavement. The death of Princess Louise at the venerable age of 91 breaks one of the few connecting links with the middle years of Queen Victoria's reign. Born in 1848 in the year of the Revolution, married in 187o the year of the Franco-Prussian War, she has died in the midst of a disturbed world. Her death takes from us a great and gracious lady. Her marriage to one outside the circle of Royalty was typical of her refusal to be bound by obsolete conventions and outworn theories, and of her forward outlook. One recalls her interest, in days when such interest was not very popular, in the cause of women's rights; recalls her work in the fields of literature and art, and particularly in sculpture. And, too, as the Prime Minister has said, she was the first member of the Royal house to fill an important position in the Overseas Dominions. Canada, with us, will mourn her death.
