The number of inventions submitted to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research is not large, and the Department's existing staff is adequate to deal quickly with those which it receives. In any event, inventions such as those relating to munitions of war, or other military, naval, air or home defence problems are referred immediately to the appropriate other Department. The second part of the Question does not therefore arise.
The Question related to inventions submitted to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. There are not many inventions submitted to that Department. There are, of course, research departments in other Departments of State, to which inventions are submitted. Questions about those should be submitted to the Ministers responsible.
