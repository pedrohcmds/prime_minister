As I said in reply to the right hon. Gentleman on Tuesday, discussions on the various proposals and counter-proposals which have been put forward are still proceeding with the Government of the U.S.S.R. and other interested Governments. There has at no stage been any avoidable delay on the part of His Majesty's Government in pressing forward with those discussions. In particular, views on the Soviet proposals have been exchanged with the French Government. A communication was received yesterday on this subject from the French  Government, and it is hoped to be able to send a further expression of His Majesty's Government's views to Moscow in the very near future.
