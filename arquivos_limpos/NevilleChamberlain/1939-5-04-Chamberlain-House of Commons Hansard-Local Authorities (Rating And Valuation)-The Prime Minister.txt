No, Sir. There is already a Committee which is sitting on the question connected with valuation for the purposes of rating, and I think, at any rate, it would be necessary to hear what that Committee had to say before any other steps were taken.
I appreciate the fact that the two points are different, and in that case I think one has a bearing upon the other.
