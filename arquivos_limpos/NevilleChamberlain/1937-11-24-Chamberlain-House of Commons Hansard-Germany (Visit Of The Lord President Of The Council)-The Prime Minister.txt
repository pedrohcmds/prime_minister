As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the House on 12th November, the visit of the Lord President of the Council was entirely private and unofficial. It had, however, as the House is aware, been arranged that Lord Halifax should see Herr Hitler, which he accordingly did on 19th November at Berchtesgaden, being accompanied by Baron Von Neurath, the German Foreign Minister.
