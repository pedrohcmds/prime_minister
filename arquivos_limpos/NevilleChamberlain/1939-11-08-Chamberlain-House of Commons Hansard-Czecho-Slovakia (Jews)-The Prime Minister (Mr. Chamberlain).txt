The Munich Agreement was concerned only with the terms and conditions governing the cession to Germany of the Sudeten-German territory, and Article 7 was intended to provide for the position of the Jews and other minorities in the Sudetenland. The question of the protection of the Jews in the rest of Czechoslovakia did not arise at the time of the Munich Conference, and was, therefore, outside its scope.
