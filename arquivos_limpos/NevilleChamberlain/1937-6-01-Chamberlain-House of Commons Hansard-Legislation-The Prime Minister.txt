The main Bill, as I have already said, will be introduced next Session.
I cannot add anything about the contents of the Bill which will not be introduced until next Session.
I thought I had made it pretty clear in my original reply that the collection and registration of particulars concerning the units of separate ownership of coal and associated rights and of existing working leases will be dealt with in that Bill. That originally would have been part of the main Bill, but as we cannot get the whole Bill through, we are doing that part of the Bill now so as to save time later.
That is so.
I said that there was no change in the plan of the Government except on the point of time.
There is not any alteration in the position as it was last stated in this House, except on the point of time.
