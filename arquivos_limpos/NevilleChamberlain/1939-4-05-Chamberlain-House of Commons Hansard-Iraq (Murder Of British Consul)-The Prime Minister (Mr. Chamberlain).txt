His Majesty's Government have heard with profound regret of the tragic death of Mr. Monck-Mason. I understand that shortly before noon yesterday a crowd gathered in Mosul to mourn the late King Ghazi, whose death at an early age has aroused feelings of deep sympathy, which I know the House would wish me to express. The crowd was worked into a passion by agitators who declared that the British Government were in some way responsible for the King's death. Such allegations are, of course, without the slightest foundation. Our reports state that the British Consulate was stormed and the Consul murdered before the local authorities had time to act. Troops and police were called out at once, and four men, who are believed to be responsible for the murder, were arrested. Martial law was declared and order restored. In the afternoon the Iraqi Prime Minister called at the British Embassy at Bagdad and expressed to His Majesty's Charg√© d'Affaires the deep sorrow of the Iraqi Government at the tragic events in Mosul,  which he said had been a terrible shock to himself and his colleagues.
