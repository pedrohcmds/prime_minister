Has the right hon. Gentleman considered the danger in this acquiescence in breaches of international law—the sinking of ships where there is no question of belligerency and the indiscriminate bombing, which are breaches of international law—and is there no effective action which the right hon. Gentleman's Government can take in order not to acquiesce in this degeneration of warfare; and may I further ask whether he has considered that, in the circumstances, it would be well to allow the Spanish Government to import anti-aircraft guns to protect not only British ships, but to protect their women and children?
Has the right hon. Gentleman considered, in addition to making representations to General Franco, making representations to Governments that supply the aircraft, and which are friendly Governments?
Is not the Prime Minister in fact abandoning the cause for which this country has stood for years, in acquiescing in the kind of warfare which brought the United States into the field in the last War?
In view of the grave issues involved, I beg to give notice that we shall take an early opportunity of raising a Debate on this matter.
