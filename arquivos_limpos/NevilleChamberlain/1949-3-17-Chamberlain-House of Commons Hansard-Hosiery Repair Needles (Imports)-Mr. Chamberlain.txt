asked the President of the Board of Trade whether he is aware that hosiery repair needles are being imported for use in conjunction with machines manufactured by a French company established in this country; and whether, in view of the fact that such importation is detrimental to an all British manufacturing company which has been granted a limited production permit of machines and needles, and of the stated policy of his Department, he will reconsider the permission of this import.
Is it fair to this company, which is working on a very low quota, that there should be this tremendous flood of needles from abroad—because it is a tremendous flood—to fit machines manufactured by this French  company established in this country; and is that in accordance with the policy which has been laid down?
That answer is so unsatisfactory that I give notice that I shall endeavour to raise the question on the Adjournment.
