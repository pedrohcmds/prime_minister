Although the charge for board and accommodation of three guineas a week for husband, wife and child may not be oppressive in the case of a man earning £6, £7 or £8 a week, does not my right hon. Friend think that it is definitely oppressive in the case of a man earning £4 a week, especially when he has also to pay for all the other necessaries of life?
Would my right hon. Friend look into the matter again?
In view of the very unhelpful reply, I shall endeavour to raise this matter on the Adjournment.
