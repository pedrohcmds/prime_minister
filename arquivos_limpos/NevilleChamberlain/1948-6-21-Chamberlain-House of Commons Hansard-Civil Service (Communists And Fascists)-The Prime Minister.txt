I do not agree that there is any slippery slope in this matter. This is a matter in which every Minister must judge whether or not a certain person should be employed in a particular position. The general line which is laid down is the security of the State. That is a question for Ministers to judge, and I do not regard it as the slippery slope for democracy to defend itself against insidious attempts to overturn it.
