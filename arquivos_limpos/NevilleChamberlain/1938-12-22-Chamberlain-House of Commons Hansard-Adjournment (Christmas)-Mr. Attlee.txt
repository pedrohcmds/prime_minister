I think it is a wise precaution for an eventuality which we hope will not happen. I hope the Prime Minister will carefully consider the point as to when the public interest requires that the House shall meet, and that it will be called together in good time if there are serious matters on which the House ought to be consulted. In view of past events, many people considered that the House should have been called together earlier last time.
