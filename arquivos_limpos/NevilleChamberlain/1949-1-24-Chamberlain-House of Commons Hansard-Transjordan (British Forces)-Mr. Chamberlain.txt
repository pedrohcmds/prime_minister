asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether the despatch of British forces to Aqaba was based on consultation with the Government of Transjordan under the Treaty of Alliance of April. 1948.
If consultations took place, does my hon. Friend think that the decision was wise or in accordance with the Security Council decision of 24th May last?
Does not my hon. Friend think that it conflicts with Article Four of the Treaty itself, and has he examined it in that connection?
