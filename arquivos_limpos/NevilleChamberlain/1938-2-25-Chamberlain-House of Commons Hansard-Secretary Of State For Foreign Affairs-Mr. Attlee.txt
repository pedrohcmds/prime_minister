(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he can now state the name of the new Foreign Secretary?
Are we to take it, therefore, that the newspapers are entirely incorrect in saying that already it has been decided to appoint a Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who will not be sitting in this House?
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to realise that at the present time, as he knows, foreign affairs are a burning issue in this country, and that, if this House is to be shut down by not having a Foreign Secretary to answer on these important questions, it raises a very big constitutional issue.
May I give notice that, in the event of the appointment of a Foreign Minister who is not in this House, I shall ask for time for discussion.
