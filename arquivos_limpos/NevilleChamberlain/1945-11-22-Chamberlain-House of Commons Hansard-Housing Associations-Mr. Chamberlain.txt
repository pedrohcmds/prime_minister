asked the Minister of Health whether he will now give an assurance to non-profit-making housing societies and associations which are desirous of co-operating with local authorities in the provision of houses to let and are prepared to enter into suitable agreements with those authorities, that Exchequer subsidies will be made available to them on similar terms to those which will be applicable to local authorities, as in the case of the Act of 1930 and subsequent housing legislation; and that where such  arrangements are entered into, labour and materials will be allocated accordingly.
Is my right hon. Friend aware that a number of these very valuable associations have complete plans and technical assistance ready? Will he do all in his power to facilitate the immediate prosecution of their work?
