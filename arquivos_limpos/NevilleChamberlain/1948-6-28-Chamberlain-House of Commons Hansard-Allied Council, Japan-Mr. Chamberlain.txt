asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether in view of the fact that the only occasion on which business was transacted by the Allied Council for Japan from its fifty-fourth to its sixtieth meeting inclusive was at the fifty-eighth meeting of 26th May, 1948, when a dispute arose as to its powers, he will initiate a review of its activities in relation to its terms of reference and also in relation to the functions of the Far Eastern Commission and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers.
Is it not really fantastic that there should be a series of meetings at a time when most important decisions are being made about Japan and that there should be nothing whatever on the agenda, except on one occasion when the American chairman rated his colleagues for interfering in the realm of the Supreme Commander, and that was all that happened?
In view of the unsatisfactory reply, I beg to give notice that I shall endeavour to raise this matter on the Adjournment at the earliest possible opportunity.
