I should like to consider that question.
Yes, Sir. The Standing Orders will have to be altered in order to comply with our intention to accept the second recommendation.
I do not think I can give that assurance in that form. When the Standing Order is proposed to be amended there will be an opportunity for debate. It is not for me to lay down how far debate should be restricted.
I think that is a matter which would be best discussed through the usual channels.
