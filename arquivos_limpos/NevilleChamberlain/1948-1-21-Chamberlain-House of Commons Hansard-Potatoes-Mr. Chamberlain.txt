While I appreciate the fact that I should have put down the words "fixed prices" instead of "subsidies," may I ask if the Minister is aware that there have recently been very serious shortages of potatoes in my constituency of Norwood, and does not she think that there is some connection between these shortages and the increase in fixed prices on 1st February?
