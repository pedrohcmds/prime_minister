While I do not altogether accept the analogy suggested in the latter half of the hon. Member's question, I have reached the conclusion that primary responsibility for policy as to food reserves should rest with the Minister in charge of the Department which carries out that policy. I propose to take the opportunity to relieve in some measure the very heavy burden  which now rests on my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade, and to make arrangements whereby responsibility for the Food (Defence Plans) Department will be taken over by another Minister. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has agreed to take over this duty.
