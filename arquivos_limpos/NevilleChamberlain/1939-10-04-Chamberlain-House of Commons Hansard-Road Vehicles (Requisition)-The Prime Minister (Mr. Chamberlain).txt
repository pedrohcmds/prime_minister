At present all requisitioning of vehicles under the Defence Regulations for any Government purpose is carried out only by officers of the Ministry of Transport. The Fighting Services have powers of requisition as well as of impressment, and I do not consider that it would be in the public interest to deprive them of those powers. They have, however, both before and since the outbreak of war, operated in close contact with the Ministry of Transport and will continue to do so.
