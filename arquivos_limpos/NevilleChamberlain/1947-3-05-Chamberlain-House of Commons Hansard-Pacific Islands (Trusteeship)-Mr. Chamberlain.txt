Has my hon. Friend any idea why there is this unseemly haste in going ahead with the trusteeship proposal, and is he aware that it conflicts to some degree with Articles 82 and 83 of the Charter?
May I ask why the hon. Member was so sympathetic to this proposal, which puts these islands under the sole direction of America?
In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply, I beg to give notice to raise the matter on the Adjournment.
