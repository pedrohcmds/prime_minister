Friend has invited the trade unions in the engineering trades to meet him and is seeing representatives to-day of the executives affiliated to the Engineering Joint Trades Movement. The answer to the second part of the question is in the negative, but, as the hon. Member is aware, a statement on foreign policy will be made in this House to-day.
