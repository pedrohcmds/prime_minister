I am not aware of any such statement.
I do not think he said anything of the kind.
No, Sir.
If another opportunity presents itself, and if there is any doubt upon the subject I have no doubt that some Members of the Government will be able to make the situation clear.
I do not think that the opportunity to make a statement is in reply to a question. It would be of greater length than can be given in reply to the question.
I understand there is a Question on the Paper in regard to that. Perhaps we had better wait for it.
