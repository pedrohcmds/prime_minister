A plenary meeting of the committee was held yesterday, under the chairmanship of my Noble Friend. The committee had before them the text, prepared by the Chairman's Sub-Committee, of a proposed resolution reaffirming and extending the Non-Intervention Agreement, and providing for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain, for the grant in certain circumstances of belligerent rights to the two parties in Spain, and for the  observation of the Spanish frontiers by land and sea. I am glad to be able to report that the committee agreed to adopt the plan proposed and requested the United Kingdom Government to transmit it at once on their behalf to the two Spanish parties for their approval. In consequence of the foregoing decision, the Governments of the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy yesterday paid to the International Board contributions amounting to Â£12,500 each, to enable the next stage of the preparatory work to be undertaken. The committee further agreed to ask the United Kingdom Government to arrange for the publication of the text of the plan immediately after it has been communicated to the two Spanish parties. Arrangements have been made for the transmission as rapidly as possible of the plan to His Majesty's Minister at Barcelona and to the Acting-British Agent at Burgos, and it is hoped that it will be handed to the two Spanish parties on Friday. If so the text will be made available to hon. Members on Monday.
