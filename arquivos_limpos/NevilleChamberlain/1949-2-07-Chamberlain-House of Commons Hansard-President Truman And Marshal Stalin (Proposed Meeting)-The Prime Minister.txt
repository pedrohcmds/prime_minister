No, Sir.
That is rather a different question. I quite agree as to the desirability of doing all we can to encourage world peace, but I am not aware that the method which has been suggested by the hon. Member is the best.
There is no question of pride and prejudice.
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has taken the initiative again and again. I do not know why hon. Members always seem to think that all the initiative should come from this country. A little initiative from the other side of Europe would be an advantage.
