(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make on the progress of the negotiations with the U.S.S.R.?
Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that there is uncertainty as to whether the Government are really following the policy upon which we on this side have agreed, and that the delays and dilatory action are causing uncertainty? May I ask him whether, if I put a Question down next week, he will be able to give me definite information?
I did not ask the right hon. Gentleman for a date, but for an indication of when he though it would be possible, if I put down a Question, to get some definite assurance on this matter. May I ask him whether he does not realise that the uncertainty is caused by his own past record?
