A co-ordinating committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals in time of war was set up early in September. The scale of awards will be reviewed, and recommendations made, periodically by this body, which does not, of course, adjudicate on specific cases, selection for recommendation for the award of such decorations as the Victoria Cross being a matter for the Department concerned. I am not aware of any instance in which the principles of consistency and fairness as between the various Services and between all ranks within those Services are not observed, having regard to the differences in conditions. It is open to a Department to raise any question of this kind for investigation by the committee.
