I desire, on behalf of Members of my party, to support the Motion moved by the Prime Minister. We shall all hope that this voyage will be happy and successful, and that it will increase the close ties which bind this country to the people of Canada and to the people of the United States. In these days anything that can be done should be done to unite the great Democracy of the West to the sentiments of the people of this country and the other peoples of the British Commonwealth.
