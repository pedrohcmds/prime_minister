The hon. Member knows that an offer has been made that someone on behalf of the refugees should go to British Guiana to see whether the country is suitable. That, surely, will be the first thing to do, and then migration of refugees might come afterwards.

I see no need for the creation of the new Department suggested by the hon. Member.
No, Sir, I do not think so.
I am not clear as to that, but I will make inquiries.
