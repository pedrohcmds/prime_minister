Yes, Sir. The report has now been considered and it is the intention of the Government to bring forward by way of experiment proposals which will, I hope, secure the main objects of the committee's recommendations, and at the same time meet the somewhat divergent views expressed before the committee. Should the experiment not prove successful, the matter will no doubt require further consideration. I propose to circulate in the OFFICIAL REPORT an outline of the proposals.
