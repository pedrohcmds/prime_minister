The Government are already providing  assistance designed to increase the productivity of agricultural land, and I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by setting up a Royal Commission to inquire into lands now uncultivated. I would remind the hon. Member that any steps to bring unproductive land into cultivation must have regard to the probable cost of the foodstuffs which; it could produce.
