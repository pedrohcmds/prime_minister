I think we must be guided by circumstances. I am sure we shall be anxious to give the House all the news which we can possibly give at the earliest possible moment.
I cannot add anything to the statement I have made.
No, Sir. I cannot.
My information is that German forces have landed at Bergen. There have been some reports about a similar landing at Narvik, but I am very doubtful whether those are correct, and I am informed that there is another place with a very similar name in the South of Norway which it is very possible might have given rise to a misapprehension. As to the action of the Navy, I am sure the House will wish to reserve its judgment until it is in possession of further information and that it certainly would not wish to make criticisms upon the action of the Navy. With regard to the meeting of the League of Nations, no suggestion has yet been made to us about any meeting, and I would say generally that first things must come first. There are other things which I think would be more effective than summoning a meeting of the League of Nations.
I certainly hope that all members of the League will fully recognise their obligations to victims of aggression, but I could not at this moment bind myself to take any particular action about the League of Nations. As I say, first things must come first.
