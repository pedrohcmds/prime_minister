Since no duty or tax has been paid on any of the Royal wedding presents coming into this country, is it not extremely unfair that this girl should be prevented in this way from receiving a necklace from her aunt in Brazil?
Is it not correct that the right hon. Gentleman wrote to me recently and told me that no duty or tax was paid; and is this not a most unfair discrimination?
