I do not think the appointment of Government directors is intended to exercise general control over the companies, but is intended that they should have an opportunity of expressing Government views on matters which are of interest to the Government.
Government directors do keep in touch with the Government and report to them from time to time.
Perhaps the right hon Gentleman will put that question on the Order Paper.
