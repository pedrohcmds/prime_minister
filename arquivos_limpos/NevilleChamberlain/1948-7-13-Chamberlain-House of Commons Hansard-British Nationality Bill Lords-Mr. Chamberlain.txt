I was just calling attention to certain characteristics on the expression "citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies," which I think is a rather regrettable one. It has been pointed out, and quite rightly, that it is really a residual expression. After the other parts of the Commonwealth have been dealt with, these two have to be linked together because there is nothing else that can be done about it. It is extremely artificial, and I and many others know the Colonies intimately enough to know that the idea of citizenship means little or nothing to them, whereas the idea of "British subject" means a lot, indeed practically everything. The proposed expression is a very heterogeneous and artificial expression, and indeed rather an unfortunate one because if there is one thing which those who live in the Colonies want to avoid, it is any suggestion of a tie-up with Whitehall or Downing Street. They may exaggerate the danger and difficulties of such a thing but it is very real.
