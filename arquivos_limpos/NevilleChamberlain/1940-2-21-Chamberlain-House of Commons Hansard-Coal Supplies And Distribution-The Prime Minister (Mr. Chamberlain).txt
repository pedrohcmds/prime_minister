In reply to the first Supplementary Question of the right hon. Gentleman, certainly this is not a matter which concerns the Ministry of Transport only. I shall be in direct consultation with the Secretary for Mines, the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Shipping, all of whom are concerned in the matter. In regard to the second point, of course the immediate problem is to try to overcome the shortage which now exists and which is very serious, and to that, I think, our first efforts must be directed; but I fully agree that what we have to do, when we have overcome that shortage, is to try to take such measures that it will not be likely to occur again. As to the third Question which the right hon. Gentleman put to me, I appreciate very keenly the hardships which have, unfortunately, been inflicted upon the domestic consumer, and I know that, in many cases, they must have suffered very much, especially in the extremely hard weather—[An Hon. Member: "And still are"]—and I dare say they still are, although I hope that the milder weather may have mitigated the situation to some extent. I do not like to pledge myself to dates because one does not know but what we may have a recurrence of hard weather which might add to our difficulties; but I think, as my right hon. and gallant Friend has just said, that we are now in a position to assist the domestic consumer as well as the public utility companies. Barring accidents, that is to say, barring exceptional weather and other accidents, we may hope that the situation will be materially eased in the course of a reasonably short time.
