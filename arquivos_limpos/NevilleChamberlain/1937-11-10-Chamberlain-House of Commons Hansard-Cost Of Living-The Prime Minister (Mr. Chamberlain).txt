My right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour has replied recently to a number of questions on the subject of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance in relation to the cost of living, and has indicated certain action which the Unemployment Assistance Board are taking. I would refer in particular to the replies given by him to the hon. Members for Doncaster (Mr. Short) and Llanelly (Mr. j. Griffiths) on 21st October, and to the hon. Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) on 28th October. My right hon. and gallant Friend the Financial Secretary has replied to analogous questions as regards pensions, in particular on 28th October, to my hon. Friend the Member for West Leeds (Mr. V. Adams). As regards the last part of the question, in view of the discussion which took place within the last few days in the Debate on the Address and the references to this subject then made by my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I do not think there is  any ground for making arrangements for a further discussion.
