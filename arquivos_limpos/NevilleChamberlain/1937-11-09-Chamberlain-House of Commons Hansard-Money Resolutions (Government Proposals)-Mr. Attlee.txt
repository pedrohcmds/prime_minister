May I ask the Prime Minister whether any alteration will be needed in the Standing Orders?
As this is a matter relating to the procedure of the House, may I ask, Mr. Speaker, whether you would care to express an opinion on these suggestions?
On behalf of the Opposition I would echo what the Prime Minister has said with regard to the debt that the House is under to the Select Committee, and also I would thank the Government for the effort they have made to meet the situation in regard to this proposal.
