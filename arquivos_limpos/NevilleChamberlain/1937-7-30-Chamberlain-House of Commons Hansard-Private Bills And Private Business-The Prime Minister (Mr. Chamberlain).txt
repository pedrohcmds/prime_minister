The House will have heard with very great regret the terms of the letter which you, Sir, have read to us. I will not say anything further about the contents of the letter at this moment, but I desire to give notice that when we meet again I shall, in accordance with precedent, move a Motion expressing the thanks of this House to Sir Horace Dawkins for his long service to us.
