While I appreciate what my hon. Friend has said, and also the great difficulty and complexity of the situation, may I ask him if he could add a word with regard to two points: first, is everything being done towards the demilitarisation of Jerusalem? Secondly, is anything being done for the protection of the oil refineries at Haifa?
Can we be assured by the Minister that the strong line by the Security Council asked for by Count Bernadotte will be supported by our Government? Could I have an answer?
