Whilst appreciating what the Foreign Secretary says, may I ask him if he will bear in mind that there are still very great psychological and moral values in initiative of this kind even though it is not accepted, and also that the Council is to be called the Council of Europe and not of Western Europe.
Will my right hon. Friend keep an open mind on the question?
