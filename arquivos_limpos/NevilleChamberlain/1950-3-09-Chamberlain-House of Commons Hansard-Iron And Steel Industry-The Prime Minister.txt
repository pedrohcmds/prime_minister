It is a curious thing that the right hon. Gentleman put this to me very solemnly: that there is no wish to repeal the Iron and Steel Act, only to postpone it. There is to be, so he says, yet another election on this issue. How many elections are we to have? The right hon. Gentleman has had two elections on this. He has been beaten both times. Is every industry to be kept in a state of suspense until the right hon. Gentleman wins a General Election? What about the position of the road transport industry? Is it to wait in absolute suspense until the right hon. Gentleman has had another election? Or perhaps he will win a third, and divide up the coal industry again. Has that to wait?
