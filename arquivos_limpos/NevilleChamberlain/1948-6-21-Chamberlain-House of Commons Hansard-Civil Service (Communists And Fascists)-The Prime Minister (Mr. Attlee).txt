I am aware that my right hon. Friend has ruled that all employment in the Air Ministry Headquarters establishment must be regarded as employment in connection with work the nature of which is vital to the security of the State. My right hon. Friend informs me that the statement in the second part of the Question is inaccurate. The position of Air Ministry outstations is still under consideration. I cannot accept the view that the action taken by my right hon. Friend constitutes any extension of the policy announced to the House on 15th March.
