I do not wish to prolong the matter unduly. I think I have made my attitude and views very clear. I was merely quoting what the right hon. Member seemed to be thinking 10 years ago. He is now apparently standing on his head.
I did not suggest that. I referred to State expenses, other than domestic and personal expenses, which should be a rational charge to an expense account.
I did not attempt to fix any figure. My suggestion was entirely elastic. The point was that there should be economy and I was hopeful that it would be a very low figure for expenses. I did not fix a limit and my suggestion was more elastic than anyone else's.
I did not suggest that the persons concerned should be  rationalised; only that the system should be rationalised.
