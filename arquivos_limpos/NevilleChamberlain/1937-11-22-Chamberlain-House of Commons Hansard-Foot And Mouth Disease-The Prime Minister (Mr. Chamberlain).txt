The present situation with regard to foot-and-mouth disease in this country, although serious, is not alarming, and there is no reason to suppose that the measures which have proved successful in the past in preventing the spread of the disease and eventually in securing its eradication will not again achieve that end. I do not think, therefore, that any useful purpose would be served by having a discussion at the present moment. My right hon. Friend is carefully watching the situation. He appreciates the desire of the House to be kept fully informed, and will be glad to take such opportunities as are afforded him at Question Time to give hon. Members full information.
