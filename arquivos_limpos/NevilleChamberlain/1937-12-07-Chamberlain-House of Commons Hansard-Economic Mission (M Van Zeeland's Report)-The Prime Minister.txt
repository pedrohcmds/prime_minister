I cannot say when the report will be received, but I have no reason to think that it will be long delayed.
That is rather a different question. I was asked whether I would make a public statement. I said I would consider the question when the report was received. The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the question of the publication of the report is not a matter for me to decide alone. It  is a matter also for M. Van Zeeland and the French Government. Perhaps I may add that I have no reason to suppose that either of them will object to the publication of the report.
