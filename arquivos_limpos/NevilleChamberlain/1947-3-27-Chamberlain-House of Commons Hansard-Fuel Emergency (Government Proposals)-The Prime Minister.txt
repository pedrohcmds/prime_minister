I propose, with Mr. Speaker's permission, to make a further statement on the fuel position.
indicated assent.
I was not aware that my right hon. Friend said anything  derisory. I believe that he said that the matter was under review, which does not sound very much like derision. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that we are pursuing, with the utmost intensity, the question of getting more coal.
I am quite sure that the hon. and gallant Member knows of the difficulties about allocation of coal from the Ruhr, and also of the demands of France and other countries. In these matters we have to work with other countries. I am well aware of the suffering caused to domestic consumers, but we have to appeal to everyone in this matter, because industrial production is essential to the country.
As I was a Member of the Government of that day I should not like to discuss domestic details like that.
I will certainly consider whether a statement made on the wireless would be useful.
It is quite easy to put up that objection to every kind of economy, by saying that it will not fill the gap, and that it will be troublesome, but in this matter one cannot go on political theory. We have to take steps to see that we can get the coal we want. If conditions improve, so much the better.
That is not a question which should be put to me; the matter should first be taken up with the supply undertakings, and then perhaps with the appropriate Minister.
