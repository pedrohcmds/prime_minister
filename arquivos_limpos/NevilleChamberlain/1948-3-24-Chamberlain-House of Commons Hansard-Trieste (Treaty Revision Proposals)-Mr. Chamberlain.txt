Since my right hon. Friend stated in this House that Trieste is directly under the control and protection of the Security Council, would it not have been wiser, from every point of view, first to have submitted the proposal through the Security Council, even if there was an election going on in Italy?
Would my right hon. Friend at least bear in mind that the demise of the League of Nations started when its machinery was by-passed?
