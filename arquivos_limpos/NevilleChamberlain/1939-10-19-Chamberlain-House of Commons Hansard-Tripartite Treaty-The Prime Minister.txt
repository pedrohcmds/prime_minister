The House will remember that I made a statement on 12th May in the House to the effect that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Turkish Government had agreed to conclude a definitive long-  term agreement of a reciprocal character in the interests of their national security. Pending the conclusion of this agreement, His Majesty's Government and the Turkish Government declared that in certain circumstances they were prepared to co-operate effectively and to lend each other all aid and assistance in their power. It was subsequently decided, as a result of conversations between His Majesty's Government and the Turkish Government and the French Government, that this long-term agreement should be in the form of a Tripartite Treaty between Great Britain, France and Turkey. Though the negotiations which have been proceeding since I made the statement on 12th May have been protracted, they have never shown any material difference in views and they have throughout been conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust and confidence.
I do not know what the hon. Member means. The full terms of the Treaty as signed will be published to-morrow.
