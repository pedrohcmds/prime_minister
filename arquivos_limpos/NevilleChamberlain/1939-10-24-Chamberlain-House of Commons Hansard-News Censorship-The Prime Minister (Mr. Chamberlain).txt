As I stated on 3rd October, the censors in dealing with particular items of news will be guided by the directions of the Departments concerned with the subject matter of such news. To facilitate the giving of such directions members of the staffs of the various Departments have been specially attached to the Press and Censorship Bureau. The expenditure of the bureau will be accounted for by the Home Office; and, subject to the arrangement just described by which each Minister will remain responsible for the handling of news concerning his own Department, the Director-General will be answerable to the Home Secretary.
