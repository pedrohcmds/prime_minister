Yes, Sir. I have for some time been in correspondence with my fellow Prime Ministers with a view to arranging an early discussion between us in London on broad general questions of common concern. As I have explained to the House before, there is a standing difficulty in finding a time at which all the Prime Ministers, with their heavy domestic responsibilities, are able to leave home. For this reason, it has not been possible to arrange a meeting, as I had hoped to, during the summer
I could not make a statement on exactly what will be the extent of these discussions. Obviously, it is a matter which I have to discuss with the other Prime Ministers.
I think that is obviously quite impossible at the moment. My hon. Friend will realise that, at this very moment, they are engaged in a plebiscite for the future Government of that country.
That hardly arises.
Certainly; that is always understood.
