While also congratulating the Minister without the reservation of the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Lewes (Major Beamish), may I also ask, when the details of the scheme are announced, that a guide be given to the people as to the particular foods which are required, and which should be sent? Will he also say a word with regard to Austria? He mentioned the subject of a scheme for Germany. Does it also apply to Austria?
