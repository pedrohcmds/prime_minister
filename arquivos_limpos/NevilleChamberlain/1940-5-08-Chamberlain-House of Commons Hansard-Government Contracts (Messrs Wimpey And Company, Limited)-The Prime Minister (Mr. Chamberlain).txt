No, Sir. As stated by my right hon. Friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in answer to the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Davidson) on 9th April, it is not considered to be in the national interest to disclose the number and value of contracts placed with individual contractors, but I may add that the figure mentioned on that occasion by the hon. Member for Maryhill as being quoted commonly in Scotland has so little relation to the truth as to be utterly fantastic.
