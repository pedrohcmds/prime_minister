While one realises that a Minister may be called away for some particular purpose connected with his Department, there are other Ministers; and very often lately the Front Bench has been left represented by an Under-Secretary or two, and a few Whips, and the Patronage Secretary has been in charge. The point I am putting is that there ought to be some Cabinet Minister,  responsible to this House, to conduct the business of the Government.
