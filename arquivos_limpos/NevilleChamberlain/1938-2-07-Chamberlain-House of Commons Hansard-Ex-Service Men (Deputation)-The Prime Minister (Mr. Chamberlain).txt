I have now received reports from both the British Legion and the Scottish section of the Legion, the second of which only reached me on Saturday, 29th January. I am intimating to both parties that I am prepared to meet a joint deputation from them on any date which will be mutually convenient. Until the proposals of the Legion, which are very far-reaching, have been fully considered by the Government, I am not in a position to say what further action may be found desirable.
