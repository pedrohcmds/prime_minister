Can my hon. Friend say why, after this very lavish and extravagant award of £32 million, which has delighted the City, he should follow it up with a further award of £1,148,000 in interest after payment of tax, which has made the City delirious with joy?
Although it is in accordance with the Act the rate of interest was decided by the Treasury. Is not this wrong treatment of the national finances?
