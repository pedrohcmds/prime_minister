I think, if I may say so, the hon. Member is not looking at  this matter from the right aspect. This is not a favour to be offered by this Government to the Governments of His Majesty's Dominions overseas. It is a question of the best possible co-operation between the various Governments concerned, and I can tell the hon. Member that we are in close co-operation with them and we should have their agreement, I have no doubt, in any steps that we may take.
