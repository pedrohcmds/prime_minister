Is it not extremely undesirable that high ranking officers like Field-Marshal Montgomery should be allowed to make highly inflammatory and warlike speeches, such as he made recently. Is that a desirable practice?
Will my right hon. Friend read Field-Marshal Montgomery's speech, made ten days ago at the Hague, and consider giving him some kind of guidance as to what to say?
