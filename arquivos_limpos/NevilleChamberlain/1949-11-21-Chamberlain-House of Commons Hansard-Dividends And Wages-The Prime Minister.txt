No, Sir. It is not possible in tabular form to give a true indication of the results of the Government's White Paper policy although, in fact, the response to my appeal has been most satisfactory. I am well satisfied with the co-operation which the Government has so far received from both sides of industry in this matter.
No, Sir. I very much deprecate this attempt to play off one side against the other when both sides are co-operating. The hon. Member should realise that there were a number of claims which were already in, when that statement was made, which came to arbitration and in which increases were awarded. It is quite true, I am glad to say, that a very high percentage of dividends have not been increased, but in my view, both sides have made great efforts.
