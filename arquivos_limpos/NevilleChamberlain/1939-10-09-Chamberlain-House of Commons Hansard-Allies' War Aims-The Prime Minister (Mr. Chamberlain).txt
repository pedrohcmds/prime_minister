His Majesty's Government and the French Government are in complete accord as to the purposes for which we entered the war and these purposes have more than once been already stated by both Governments. No doubt as time goes on both Governments will consider whether their war aims should be stated in more specific form. In any case the hon. and learned Member may take it that any such statement would be made only by agreement between the two Governments.
