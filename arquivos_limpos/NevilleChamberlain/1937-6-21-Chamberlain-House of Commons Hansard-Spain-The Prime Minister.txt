We have not at the moment sufficient information to enable us to say what is the best method of dealing with this problem. I think everybody desires to do everything he can to help in a humanitarian work, but the situation is at present very obscure. We do not know at this moment what the numbers of the refugees are, or what sort of refugees they are, or what possibilities there are of helping them. Those are the things we are trying to find out.
Certainly, and I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman.
We have, as of course the right hon. Gentleman knows, given the protection of British warships to British and other ships carrying Basque women and children, and in similar circumstances we shall be prepared to give the same protection.
I think that was because the French authorities were not at the time ready to take the children.
I understood my Noble Friend to specify women and children. In that case, certainly.
The right hon. Gentleman knows that the situation in France is not such as to be conducive to the speedy obtaining of information, but we will do all we can.
