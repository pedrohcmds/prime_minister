The new problems concerning both the supply and the distribution of food created by the war are being dealt with by the Ministry of Food, which was set up expressly for that purpose. There are, of course, certain aspects of food policy which fall within the sphere of other Departments. It would be impracticable to combine responsibility for all these in the functions of a single Department. Close contact is, however, maintained between Departments, and the necessary co-ordination of the broad lines of policy is secured through the Food Policy Committee of the War Cabinet, presided over by my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal.
