No, Sir. It is, however, the practice of His Majesty's Government, in order to provide opportunity for Parliamentary consideration in ordinary cases, to lay treaty engagements for 21 Parliamentary days before ratification by His Majesty in all cases when the continuance of the Parliamentary Session makes this course practicable. When it does not, or when considerations of urgency require ratification without this preliminary, action would be taken accordingly and Parliament would be notified as soon as may be afterwards.
