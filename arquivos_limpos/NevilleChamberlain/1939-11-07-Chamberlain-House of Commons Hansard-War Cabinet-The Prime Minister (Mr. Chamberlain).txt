My attention has been called to a statement recently made in a newspaper to the effect that there is now an Inner Cabinet composed of the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal, whose decisions are withheld from the Defence Ministers until they come before the War Cabinet in the form of recommendations. The statement is entirely without foundation. I cannot too strongly deprecate the publication in war time of such malicious inventions which, while they may do little harm in this country provide enemy propagandists with precisely the kind of material for which they are constantly seeking.
