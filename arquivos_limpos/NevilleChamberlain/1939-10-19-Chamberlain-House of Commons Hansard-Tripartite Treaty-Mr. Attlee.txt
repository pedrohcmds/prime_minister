I am quite sure that I shall be expressing the views not only of Members on this side of the House but in all parts of the House, in welcoming the statement made by the Prime Minister that we have brought to a successful conclusion these negotiations for a tripartite agreement between Great Britain, France and Turkey, and to express the hope that it may long endure and that our friendship with Turkey may be strengthened for many years to come.
