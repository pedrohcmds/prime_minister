There are many opportunities for discussing this matter in the House, in the ordinary round of the Parliamentary Session. The Government are considering the matter, but we are not convinced, nor likely to be convinced, that a Select Committee would be the best way of dealing with it.
I can only say that these matters are constantly under the attention of the War Cabinet and of the Ministers especially concerned. The House may rest assured that the matter is not being left to slide or being overlooked. I am not in a position at present to offer a Select Committee.
I am not able to give an indication as to when a decision will be reached.
I am afraid I cannot reconsider a decision within a very few moments of its having been announced. We will consider the matter.
