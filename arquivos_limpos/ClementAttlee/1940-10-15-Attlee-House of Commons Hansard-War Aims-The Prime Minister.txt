I do not think anyone has the opinion that we are fighting this war merely to maintain the status quo. We are, among other things, fighting it in order to survive, and when our capacity to do that is more generally recognised throughout the world, when the conviction that we have about it here becomes more general, then we shall be in a good position to take a further view of what we shall do with the victory when it is won.
I think there is great danger in making statements which are not of a very general character upon this subject. Take, for instance, the attitude which we adopt towards the enemy when he is defeatedâ€”you will find very different opinions prevailing about that.
Certainly I bear it in mind, and, having borne it in mind, I have ventured to give the answer which I have given.
I think world opinion, as far as it is free, is thoroughly behind us.
I have seen the announcement from the Ministry of Information, and I have no doubt that very interesting discussions will take place, but that is quite a different thing from a statement by His Majesty's Government.
