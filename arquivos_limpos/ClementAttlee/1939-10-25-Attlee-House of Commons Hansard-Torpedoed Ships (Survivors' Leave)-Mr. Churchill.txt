It is the intention of the Admiralty that the survivors of any of His Majesty's ships which may be sunk during the war, should be granted a period of leave before they are drafted to other duty. Leave was so given to the survivors of His Majesty's Ship "Courageous" and His Majesty's Ship "Royal Oak" and this practice will be continued, provided the manning situation permits.
