The House, without distinction of party, is endebted to the Foreign Secretary for the clear, temperate and able statement he has made upon the disappointing events which have taken place. I suppose that the House will wish, on some convenient occasion, to debate the general position of our foreign affairs, but we on this side of the House should be very ready to consult the Government's convenience in the matter as to whether it should be next week or the week after. I would suggest, if it were agreeable, that discussions should proceed through the usual channels with a view to determining what time would be most in accordance with convenience and the public interest for the discussion on this matter to be resumed.
