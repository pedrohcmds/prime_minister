As a general rule and guiding principle it may be assumed by the Opposition that complete agreement reigns among the Members of Her Majesty's Government.
The House is going to be informed of the very serious measures which are being taken in all fields in order to enable us to pay our way and live on our earnings and exports, but of all the suggestions which have been made to be helpful in this matter none has been more far from the truth than the one with which the right hon. Gentleman, with the least excuse in the world, has identified himself.
I should be trespassing on the rules of the House and  altogether under-rating the complexity of the statement I should have to make if I attempted to do such a thing at Question time.
If the Question simply asked me to make a full statement about the changes which would have to be made in every branch of our expenditure, I should certainly ask the right hon. Gentleman and the House to wait until the two days' debate which, I understand, is being arranged before we separate.
I have not the text of what Lord Swinton said before me, but I have no doubt that we are viewing the scene through the same eyes, or through eyes which are harmoniously converging.
We have not very much time before we are condemned to go on holiday, but we are going to have a two days' debate at which very grave and far-reaching matters affecting every branch of our national life, both domestic and defensive, will have to be brought into a new survey and presentation of our present position.
