I am already devoting particular attention to this question, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned.
I do not think a board is necessary, because there is the closest working between the organisations on both sides of the Atlantic.
My information does not suggest that security officers require further powers; and, in view of the wide variety of establishments to which the hon. Gentleman refers, I doubt whether it would be practicable or desirable to impose a greater uniformity of  practice. I am, however, asking the Ministers responsible to give special attention to the need for vigilance regarding the security of these establishments.
Yes, Sir, I am doing my best to ensure that that shall not happen.
I have myself made inquiries into this from time to time and I shall give continuing attention to the possibility of adapting the methods in use to meet changing needs and circumstances.
It seems that in the process of recent years we must have returned to the 17th century interpretation of the word. That is how it is used today.
I am well aware that there is some uneasiness, but in these matters, while we have to take the utmost precautions, we also have to preserve the general conditions of the rights of the individual and the liberty of the subject in this country. We cannot employ, and we will not employ, the kind of methods employed in totalitarian countries.
No, Sir.
Because at a certain time there has been what has been called "screening" in the case of a person engaged in high security work, it does not mean that care is not taken thereafter from time to time to follow up any possible danger. I should not like it to be thought that necessarily because someone had been "screened" at a certain time, no steps are taken thereafter. They are, from time to time.
