Certain of my right hon. Friends and I have had three meetings with the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and other Privy Councillors on the subject of defence. As the House is aware, the object of these meetings was to enable certain right hon. Members, who are in a special position as members of His Majesty's Privy Council, to be put in possession of information which it would not be in the public interest to make widely known. There was, of course, no idea of reaching specific agreements or decisions at these talks, and the second part of the Question does not therefore arise.
