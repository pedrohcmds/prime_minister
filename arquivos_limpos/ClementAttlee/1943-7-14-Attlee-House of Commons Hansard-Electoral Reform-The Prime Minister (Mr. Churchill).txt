The first point raised in this Question has been carefully considered, and it has been decided not to reduce the age qualification below 21 for the next General Election in respect of Service or ex-Service men and women, since any such step would operate harshly on those other young persons who, by virtue of their essential war work, have been unable to join the Forces. Since the other points raised will be open for discussion during the opportunity to be afforded to Parliament to discuss questions of electoral reform in good time before the next General Election, I do not consider it necessary for these matters to be investigated at this time by a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry.
