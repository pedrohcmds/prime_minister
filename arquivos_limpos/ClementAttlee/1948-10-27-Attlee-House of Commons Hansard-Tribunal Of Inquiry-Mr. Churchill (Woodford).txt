It is refreshing to feel that there is no difference of any kind between the two sides of the House upon the statement which the Prime Minister has just made. Whatever differences we may have, there is no doubt that this House of Commons has shown itself most vigilant in matters affecting the honour of Members or Ministers in questions of breach of confidence or questions of breach of privilege, or in questions of the character which are now brought to our notice. No Parliament has shown itself more vigorous and forward in this matter, and we have no complaint whatever to make of the course which the Prime Minister has proposed.
