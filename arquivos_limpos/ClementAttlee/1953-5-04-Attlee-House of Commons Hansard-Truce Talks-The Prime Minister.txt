I take it that there is permission, as it would be for the convenience of the House. Both these Questions overlap.
I would be delighted to answer any question that comes to me in the ordinary course of Parliamentary business.
I should have notice of questions like that, which raise considerable issues. We are in close touch with the United States on these matters. We have a most sincere desire, which is shared in all parts of the House, to see this obstacle of the prisoners' forcible repatriation removed. That is a matter of honour, but we earnestly hope that it may be overcome. It certainly is very near to being overcome and I think we may hopefully await the further development of events.
I think that the matters of principle have been settled. It is now a question of method. I really do not see why there should not be an  agreement on this and why we should not move forward pretty quickly to larger topics and aspects in Korea. But it does not rest entirely with our side, as it were, in this war that is taking place in Korea. I am sure of thisâ€”that if agreement on method cannot be reached now it is not because of any difficulties arising out of the specific issues, but because of extraneous considerations which may be in the minds of those with whom we are arguing.
I am sure that we would have a much better chance of getting a satisfactory solution under the conduct of General Harrison, who has been acting in accordance with instructions he received from higher authority, than we should have even if the hon. Lady volunteered herself to go.
