May I ask the Prime Minister what will be the business for next week, and also how far it is proposed to go to-night in the event of the Eleven o'Clock Rule being suspended?
With regard to Tuesday's business, it is obviously difficult to judge how long the Debate on Members' salaries will take, but I take it that it will not be proposed to take the Third Reading of the Factories Bill, which is very important, at a very late hour that night?
May I further ask the Prime Minister whether the Government propose to give a day for discussion of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference?
