May I, by the indulgence of the House, ask the Prime Minister if in view of certain statements which have just been made on the one o'clock Broadcast he has any statement to make to the House?
I did not listen either but I am informed that it was stated that there was reason to believe that the Soviet Government had delivered an ultimatum to Yugoslavia. Have the Government any statement to make? It is not right that such rumours should go long uncontradicted.
