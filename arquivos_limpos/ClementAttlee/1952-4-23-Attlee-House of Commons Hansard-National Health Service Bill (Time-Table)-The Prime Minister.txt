I do not want to do anything to prolong the proceedings, but it may be that a statement will be made tomorrow on business and on agricultural prices. But those are not statements which should give rise to a debate. These always have been matters which the House has disposed of smoothly at the time and has discussed when opportunities for debate have offered themselves; in my long experience, never have they been advanced in connection with the use of the Guillotine. When I was a member of the Liberal Party these matters of business and announcements for the convenience of the House were not made reasons for subtracting from the time given to the various compartments into which discussion under the Guillotine was divided.
The way the right hon. and learned Gentleman is using it now?
No.
