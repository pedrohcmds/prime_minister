We are entirely in accord on this side of the House with the proposal which the Prime Minister has made. We think that such a gathering here in January would be opportune and that the discussion which will take place may be fruitful for the purposes in hand; and the visitors who come to carry it out will be warmly welcomed by all parties in the State.
