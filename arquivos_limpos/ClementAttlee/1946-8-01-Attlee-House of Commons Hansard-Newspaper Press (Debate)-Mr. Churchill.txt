May I ask the Leader of the House before we separate a Question of which I have given him private notice, namely, whether he proposes to give time for an early Debate dealing with the Press of this country, and before any inquiry or commission is set up, in view of the statements which have been made by Members of the Government on this subject?
In the meanwhile, before the Debate takes place, will the acting Prime Minister—or the Leader of the House, or the Lord President—will he in all these capacities endeavour to restrain the Attorney-General from prejudicing the issue by all kinds of disordered public statements before any question of an inquiry is decided?
