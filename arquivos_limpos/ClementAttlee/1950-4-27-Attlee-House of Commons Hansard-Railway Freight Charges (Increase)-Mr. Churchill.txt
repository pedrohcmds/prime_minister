May I ask the Lord President of the Council on the question of debate in connection with this matter whether he will consider the following: We are now informed or given notice, that on 15th May a new tax of £27 million a year will be put upon the public and upon industry by raising the rates of freights on the railways—£27 million a year which is almost half the tax we voted on yesterday. Is there any reason why the House of Commons should not have an opportunity in Government time and on Government responsibility of debating so heavy an additional charge on the life and activity of the nation?
They were.
It is the taxpayer's money.
Does this not constitute a very great abrogation of Parliamentary liberties and of the duty of the House of Commons to deal with burdens laid upon the public and money extracted from them? Here is the right hon. Gentleman. imposing a tax of £27 million in a year. [HON. MEMBERS: " It is not a tax." It is in all except the name a tax on the public, and the right hon. Gentleman does not even feel that the Government have the responsibility to give some opportunity for discussing it.
And if the steel shareholders lost their money they had no means of coming to the Government and the House of Commons to recoup themselves.
Everything is bias. except what the right hon. Gentleman says.
Before that question is answered, may I ask what redress railway shareholders would have had if, owing to the misfortunes of the enterprise in which their money was invested, their dividends were reduced?
Was this arrangement made by a Conservative Government or by the Socialist Government?
May I assure the right hon. Gentleman that it was from no prejudice on my part—on the contrary, I had a predisposition in that direction—it was from no prejudice that I opposed the nationalisation of railways at about the most unsuitable time that the State could have embarked upon such a step.
Let us pray.
