I think a debate on this subject might well be useful, but we have no time at present for it, and, in any case, all questions of that character must be addressed to my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal.
I think all these things should be considered, and there is no reason why friendly discussions should not take place, not only through the usual channels but through any channels which may be open. But while such a close balance exists and such bitterly developed party differences rule, it might be very difficult to arrive at any advantageous solution to our present difficulties.
