Here is a local paper, published in English, which is owned by an Egyptian registered company and the controlling interest among the shareholders is held by an Englishwoman resident in Alexandria. This paper has only been presenting the Egyptian side of the case, and I do not think it fair that troops should be left for several days at a time before news arrives in the papers of all the parties in this country and only receive this anti-British dope.
Certainly, it really would be necessary to allow that. That is why the "Egyptian Gazette" has been allowed to be circulated to the troops but, of course, the British papers sent out, from the "Daily Herald" to the "Daily Express"—from one side of politics to the other—are all in favour of the British point of view, oddly enough.
