Could we have an answer to the question as to what flag it was sailing under?
How is it possible for one of His Majesty's ships to approach another ship at very close quarters and not be able to discern the pattern of the flag which that ship is wearing?
Do I understand that the hon. Gentleman said he cannot because he has not got the information with him, and not that there is any serious reason against it?
Will the hon. Gentleman give the information?
May I press this point about the flag? I understand that the hon Gentleman can quite easily ascertain the answer to that question, and in the event of its being decided by the Prime Minister or the Leader of the House that that question had better be answered by the Colonial Office, we shall make no objection to it, but we think that this simple point about the flag should be cleared up at the earliest opportunity.
