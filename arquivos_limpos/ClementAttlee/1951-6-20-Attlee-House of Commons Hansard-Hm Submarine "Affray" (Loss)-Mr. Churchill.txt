Apart from these extremely important moral and scientific issues, what is the actual cost of a submarine of this type?
So that a certain amount of expense would be justified merely from that point of view of endeavouring to recover it?
If the "Affray" were salvaged, apart from all other considerations, it could very quickly be made ready for service again, and that, as the hon. Gentleman said, would replace a vessel which would otherwise cost £1 million. I should have thought myself that it was a little more than £1 million.
I am not so sure. Would it not be a great feather in the cap of the Admiralty if they achieved the great process of salving this vessel?
