Is it not a fact that the Governor-General of India was notified in the time of the late Government that Great Britain reserved her full rights to present a counter-claim on account of the effective defence of India by all means—land, sea, air and diplomacy—by which the freedom of India from foreign invasion was secured?
Is that point going to be made? How do we accept the great concessions made on Lend-Lease by the United States and yet divert a large portion of our remaining assets to-payment of an exactly similar war debt to the Indian Government?
