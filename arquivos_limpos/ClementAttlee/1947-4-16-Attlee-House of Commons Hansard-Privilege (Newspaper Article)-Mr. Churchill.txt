On a point of Order, Mr. Speaker. You, Sir, have ruled that this is a prima facie case. Does it not now rest with the Leader of the House?
I always understood, Mr. Speaker, that on your giving a Ruling that there is a prima facie case the Leader of the House moved that the matter should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. If, however, a Private Member can do it, that is quite agreeable to us. At the same time I think it should be seconded—[Horn. MEMBERS: "It has been"]—Are we then to understand that His Majesty's Government have no views on this matter? I think it is important that His Majesty's Government should be associated with it.
