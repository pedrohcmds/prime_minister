In view of the appeal made by the hon. Member who raised the matter, I submit that any statement made by the Chairman of the Select Committee might be considered as part of the statement made by the hon. Member who raised the  matter and not require the immediate moving of a Motion. If, however, there is to be any discussion, I would, of course, move the necessary Motion.
