While I fully appreciate the advantages of my hon. Friend's proposal, it is not within the power of the Admiralty to delay publication of such information unless there is a security reason for so doing. Even so publication is often made abroad.
Yes, Sir. In regard to His Majesty's ships, we do not publish losses until we have informed the relatives, and I should like to see that practice applicable to the Mercantile Marine, but there is nothing like the same control there, and the possibility of publication abroad must always be borne in mind.
