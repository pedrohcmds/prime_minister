As a result of the conference to which my hon. Friend refers, certain steps have been agreed upon for the immediate assistance of the fishing industry. A standing committee has been set up to advise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland on questions affecting the industry as a whole in time of war, and in particular the maintenance and distribution of supplies. It has been possible to return a number of requisitioned vessels to the industry as they have been relieved by other vessels. The question of purchasing and building further trawlers for the industry is being actively pursued.
