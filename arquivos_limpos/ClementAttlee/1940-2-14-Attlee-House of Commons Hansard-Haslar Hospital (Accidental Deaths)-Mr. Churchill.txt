I am aware of the very regrettable accident to which my hon. Friend refers. The fullest investigation is being made into all the circumstances, but in the meantime immediate steps are being taken to prevent the recurrence of such a case. For the purpose of payment of pension these men's deaths will be regarded as attributable to Naval service. The question of further compensation will be considered when the inquiries have been completed. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my sympathy with the relatives of the deceased.
