I think the OFFICIAL REPORT will enable the hon. Member's solution to this question to be placed on record and given full publicity.
The problem is complicated enough as it is.
I think that as we went in wholeheartedly and unitedly with the Americans under the authority of the United Nations and undoubtedly saved Mr. Syngman Rhee and his Government from destruction, we have a certain right.
When the Minister of Defence comes back with my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, statements will have to be made to Parliament, and it seems to me very probable that requests will be made for opportunities of debate, and the great facilities which the Opposition have in regard to Supply Days may be invoked as well. At any rate, we should certainly wish to lay the whole position frankly before the House.
Yes. When Lord Alexander comes back I am sure we shall want to hear everything he has to tell us in the Government; and also a statement on this, I think, valuable mission of his must certainly be an important feature in our discussions here.
