Officers and men who have lost service effects as a result of enemy action and are then invalided from the Navy are paid compensation by the Admiralty on the basis of the value of the articles at the time of the loss.
There is no valid grievance, because if application is made to the proper quarter compensation will be paid. On the other hand, statements to the effect that compensation cannot be paid and attempts to obtain money from other quarters would also be deserving of inquiry.
