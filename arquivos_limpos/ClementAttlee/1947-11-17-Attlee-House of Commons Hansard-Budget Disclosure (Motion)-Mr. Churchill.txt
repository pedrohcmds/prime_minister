May I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a Notice of Motion which stands on the Paper in my name, and in the name of other hon. Members, on the subject of a Select Committee to inquire into the circumstances of the disclosure of Budget information last week, and  whether he has any statement' to make upon the subject?
I am very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. I think it is in the general interest and in the interests of the House, and also in the interests of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the facts of this matter shall be put upon record by a responsible Committee in such a way as to put an end to any slanderous rumours which may be in circulation.
There is a formal demand for the inquiry from the Opposition, and I believe that the demand is also supported by the party below the Gangway.
