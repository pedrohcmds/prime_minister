I think that I will leave the hon. Gentleman, in regard to this important matter, which I think is very satisfactory, to rest on the word "shameful."
Let me answer one question at a time, please.
When the right hon. Gentleman announced that the Supreme Command in the Atlantic should go to an American admiral, I thought it a pity, because I thought that we knew most about the reception end, as I have called it. I would have preferred at that time to have had the Supreme Command in the Atlantic for Britain, and would have welcomed the Americans in the Mediterranean, because it was very desirable that they should intervene in force and with a fleet there. However, the right hon. Gentleman had his way. When I went to Washington, it was already settled. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Yes. I had to deal with a matter which had been effectively decided, but arrangements were made then, which I described in the House in as much detail as was possible, which did secure the effective control of the reception end of the Atlantic, and that we have now. That was all as a result of modifications agreed to then.
I am aware of that. When I talk of the reception end, I am not speaking only of the Iberian sector. I am speaking also of the entire Western approaches to the English Channel and all of the spheres which are open in the North.
With regard to all of this, very practical working arrangements have been made which satisfy the dignity of the nations concerned and, which is far more important, will enable the Admiralty to make their contribution as effectively as before.
I expect they will help each other, but I think that if my hon. and gallant Friend reads the answer, he will see that that is effectively provided for.
I think that my time-table ought to start from the formal decisions of N.A.T.O. rather than from casual paragraphs in the Sunday newspapers.
