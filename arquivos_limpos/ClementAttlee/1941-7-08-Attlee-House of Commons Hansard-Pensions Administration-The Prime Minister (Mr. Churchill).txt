Several Debates on the Motion for the Adjournment have been arranged this year, and another is impending, for the discussion of particular aspects of pensions administration. Moreover, I do not rule out the possibility of finding time for the Minister to present to the House the Estimates for his Department, in. which event hon. Members would have a further opportunity for more general discussion. Meanwhile the Statutory Advisory Committee to the Minister of Pensions, which contains representatives of the three principal parties, is meeting regularly, and I see no sufficient reason for a special Debate or a White Paper at the present time.
