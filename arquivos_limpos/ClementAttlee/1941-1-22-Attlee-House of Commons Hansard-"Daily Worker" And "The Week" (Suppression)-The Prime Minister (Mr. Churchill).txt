If there is a sufficient desire to debate this matter, and if that is made known, the Government will, naturally, give an opportunity for a Debate. I suggest that the usual processes should be set at work. Then, it would be necessary that the Debate should take place at the earliest possible moment, namely, on the next  Sitting Day. That would mean, of course, the postponement of the War Damage Bill; but the House must accept that as a consequence.
