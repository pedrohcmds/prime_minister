As the House is aware, the constitutional position in the Council of Europe is that the Assembly is a purely consultative body, on which representatives of the various member States speak and vote in a personal capacity without in any way committing the Governments of those States, or necessarily reflecting their views. Experience has shown that in an Assembly of this kind, private Members can more appropriately take part than Ministers who will naturally be assumed to be committing their Government to a particular course of action.
