As I stated in the course of the debate in the House on 14th December, there was a war-time partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada for the development of the atomic weapon. By agreement between the three Governments, the nature of these war-time arrangements has not been revealed on grounds of public policy. The position of the United States Administration in many of these matters is now regulated by legislation enacted in the United States since the end of the war, and the war-time arrangements have been modified accordingly. But partnership between the three countries for certain purposes in the atomic energy field continues.
If the hon. Member had listened to my reply—
—I said that the partnership between the three countries for certain purposes in the atomic energy field continued.
That would be a matter which would have to be agreed with the United States Govt.
I could inquire into that, but at the present time I am  precluded by that agreement from announcing what those arrangements were on the grounds of public policy as agreed with our co-signatories.
I am prepared to inquire. I would like perhaps to have a word with the right hon. Gentleman on this matter. It is, as he knows, rather complicated and rather delicate.
I am not aware of that statement.
This was not a treaty.
I have tried to explain twice that there was no treaty—it was a question of agreement. That agreement—[Interruption.]—there is a great deal of difference between an agreement and a treaty. There was an agreement, but the agreement has been changed and altered and new agreements have been made.
