May I ask on what grounds the statement which the right hon. Gentleman has made makes an exception in the case of the Japanese? Must we not, in this matter, be very careful not to draw distinctions between the status of East and West?
But, supposing, at any moment, the right hon. Gentleman was informed that some British soldier wished to marry a Japanese, are we to understand that he would make a great gulf of principle between that permission and the decision he has already given?
