Field marshals are always in the Army, and I am surprised that an Army schoolmaster did not know that.
I was answering the Question on the Order Paper.
I am bound to say that I thought it was rather unworthy—[HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I am going to say why when I have an opportunity—to put on the Order Paper of the House of Commons a suggestion that an officer of this distinction should be considered for prosecution, and to spread that all about the world where his name is known, and when he has a large and important international duty to discharge. Therefore, I thought it perfectly right to make a retort which, I am glad to see, has struck home.
All extremely secret messages, of which there were a great number, which were sent to commanders at the front, were, by order, destroyed immediately they had been orally imparted.
At the same time, I thought it right to pursue every channel which might yield information on a point about which I have been anxious, and, consequently, I asked whether, among private papers or diaries, there was any record. I was not aware when I began my inquiries that this strict order for destroying all documents at the moment in the headquarters at the front had prevailed, but it seems to me that it is very obvious why orders of that kind had to be destroyed.
Now that we are nine years from the war, I see no need to alter the procedure which has hitherto obtained.
