The Report of the Departmental Committee on Electoral Machinery did not deal with by-elections. That Report is under consideration by the Government; it involves complicated and important issues, and no statement can yet be made. When the Government has come to its conclusions on the Report it will consider whether any inferences can be drawn as to modifications in by-election arrangements in war-time. While it is the wish of His Majesty's Government that all possible eligible persons should have the right to record their votes, I think it proper to warn the House that the technical and practical difficulties may be formidable. It is in any case not possible for the Government to reach any conclusion as to by-elections meantime, so that I am not able to give an answer of a favourable character to the hon. Member's request. In the meantime constituencies without the services of a Member will naturally expect us to take the usual steps to enable the  vacancies to be filled, and I therefore trust the House will assent to the Writ being issued. I gather that the hon. Baronet has volunteered to offer some assistance in these matters to the Home Secretary. That, of course, is a matter which should be settled between the hon. Baronet and my right hon. Friend.
