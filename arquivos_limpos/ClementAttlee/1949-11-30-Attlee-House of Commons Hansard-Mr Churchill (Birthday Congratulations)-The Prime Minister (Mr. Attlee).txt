With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and the permission of the House, may I offer the congratulations of the House to the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition? Although in these days 75 is not a venerable age—people seem to be able to continue for several decades after that—yet 75 does mark a distinct stage in one's life, and I am quite sure that we all rejoice to see the right hon. Gentleman in full health and activity and wish him many more years.
