Sir, the Prime Minister carries the whole House with him in what he has said. The late Mr. Beaumont discharged the difficult and delicate duties in the Chair at the Table with complete impartiality, with great knowledge of the rules of the House, with much indulgence and courtesy towards Members, and with a full understanding of the traditions of this House which are not contained in any book or code of rules. On this side of the House we felt indebted to him for the necessary services which he rendered, and we share with the Prime Minister and the Government party, to the full, the deep regret with which we have learned of his untimely death. He died in harness. The interval between his presiding over the Debates in this House and the ending of his life was very short indeed, but at any rate all his days, of which we have so much knowledge in the House, were well spent and were to the credit of those great institutions on which in this difficult period the life and freedom of Britain depend.
