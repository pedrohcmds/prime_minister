Her Majesty's Government are considering this recomendation of the Select Committee. On the assumption that the existing House of Commons Commissioners are retained, it would, I am advised, be for the general advantage that they should present to the House each year a report on their work. Her Majesty's Government also favour the compilation of a code to govern the conditions of service of the staff of the House.
