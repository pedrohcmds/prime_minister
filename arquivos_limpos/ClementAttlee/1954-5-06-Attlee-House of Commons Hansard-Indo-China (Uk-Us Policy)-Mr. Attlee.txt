Why should the right hon. Gentleman assume that a Question of  this kind is mischief-making when it is quite clear that there has been trouble in the United States as to exactly our attitude, and when a little clarification might make for better understanding and not mischief-making, which is far from the wish of those on this side of the House?
But if there is a difference, it is just as well to clear it up. It is not emphasising a difference to try to get rid of it.
