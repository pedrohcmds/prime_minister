We are in general agreement with the statement which the Prime Minister has made upon this subject. I am glad that this matter has been terminated in a manner which reflects on nobody in any matter of personal honour and, at the same time, fulfils the sagacious recommendations of the Select Committee. It might well be that in the future when a reconsideration of these matters is possible, even stricter regulations might be propounded.
