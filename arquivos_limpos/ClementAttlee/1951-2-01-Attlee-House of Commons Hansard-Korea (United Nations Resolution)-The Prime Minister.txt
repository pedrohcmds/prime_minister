In reply to the right hon. Gentleman, I would say that we have already voted in the Political Committee of the United Nations. The vote will then come up in the plenary meeting. I gather that the relation between them is rather like that of a Committee of the whole House in this place and the House sitting. I am quite sure that if the right hon. Gentleman has read, I have no doubt he has, the very admirable speeches made by Sir Gladwyn Jebb at Lake Success, he will have seen very fully the meaning of these resolutions.
We have throughout all these matters kept in close touch with India and with all our fellows in the Commonwealth, and we shall continue to do so.
Yes. We are keeping in close touch with them on all these matters.
If the hon. Member is correct—and I do not know what his sources of information are—as to the very large number. I regret that there should be a large number of people who are unacquainted with the basis and the principles of the United Nations, which we are obliged to support.
No, Sir. The Good Offices Committee consists of the President, M. Entezam, and two other persons selected by him.
I think that if my hon. Friend will read the statement I have made, he will see that every endeavour is to be made by the Good Offices Committee to bring about cessation of hostilities. I think the words used in the statement were: 
As our position has been made perfectly clear on that important point, it is, perhaps, not helpful to have further questions on this rather delicate matter.
I always thought that Persia was an Asian country. M. Entezam of Persia is the President of the Good Offices Committee.
I do not think it is much use going into the legal niceties today.
