The many questions involved in the future of atomic energy, including that of the international handling of the subject and its possible development for industrial purposes, are, of course, already engaging the attention of His Majesty's Government. In my statement published on 13th August, I declared the intention of His Majesty's Government to devote all their efforts to making the new discovery serve the purpose of world peace and to co-operate with others to that end.
Yes, Sir.
The appointment of an Advisory Committee, obviously, puts no bar on Members asking any ques-  tions on this subject that they choose, but it is quite clear that, on this very far-reaching weapon, we obviously have to discuss it with our Allies and I would prefer not to make any statement.
The policy, of course, has to be decided by the Government, but this Committee will advise us both with regard to the scientific progress and the possibilities and the general background of the whole subject.
