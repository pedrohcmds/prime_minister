I am aware of the activities to which the hon. and learned Member  refers in the first part of his Question and the Admiralty is most grateful to the organisations he mentions and others, as well as to the civic authorities and individuals at Greenock for their splendid work in welcoming the naval men who are at Greenock from time to time, and in providing emergency sleeping accommodation when necessary. Arrangements for providing extra sleeping accommodation for naval personnel who exceptionally are prevented from returning to their ships, are in hand.
I must apologise that my answer does not cover that point, and may I ask the hon. and learned Member to put the Question down again?
