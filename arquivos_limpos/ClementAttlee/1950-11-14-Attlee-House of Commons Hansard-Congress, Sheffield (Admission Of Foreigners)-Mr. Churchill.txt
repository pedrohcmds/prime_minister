What was the object of the right hon. Gentleman in volunteering to us this statement at this juncture? Would he not be wise to disabuse his mind of the possibility of this occasion and the manner in which it has been handled bringing him any large measure of compliments and congratulations from  the country as a whole? Has it not given the greatest advertisement to those whom he describes with so much just severity and has it not exposed us to a very great deal of inconvenience and laid us open to much abuse? I personally am not attacking in any way the hostility of the right hon. Gentleman and the Government towards the peace conference, but if he thinks that he has handled this matter well—or that the Government in general have, for I do not blame him in particular—if he thinks that he has handled the matter with tact, skill and discretion, he is very much mistaken.
By whom?
May I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we on this side of the House are in full general accord with his purpose and intention? But we are far from being convinced that the best way and most convenient method of achieving that purpose were chosen.
Supposing that we do have another case like this coming up while conditions are in their present difficult state, would it not be right to consider as an alternative asking for special legislation from Parliament and allow the opinion of the country to be expressed upon the matter by its representatives?
Might I venture to ask you, Mr. Speaker, to make clear your Ruling on the point of whether it is a matter of a point of order for a Member to claim the special privilege when he gets up to give notice that he will raise a matter on the Adjournment or later? I am sure it would be of great interest to hon. Members who wish to act in accordance with the rules to know exactly what we may or may not prefix by saying "On a point of order."
