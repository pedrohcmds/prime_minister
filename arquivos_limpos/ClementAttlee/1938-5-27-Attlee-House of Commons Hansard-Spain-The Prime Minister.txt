The British Government have considered this matter. A good many difficulties arise in connection with it, and I am informed that the fitting of merchant vessels with antiaircraft guns would require structural alterations.
No, Sir. That is not the reply.
I did not say it was impossible. I said that it could not be done without structural alterations.
As I informed the hon. Member for West Leyton (Mr. Sorensen) on 14th June, His Majesty's Government will be ready to propose mediation either alone or in conjunction with other countries at any time when the prospects of successful action appear favourable.
