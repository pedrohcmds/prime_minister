The hon. Member is repeating a very old slander. Everybody knows that the vote against the Estimates was a vote against Government policy and not for disarmament.  If the hon. Member will look back, he will find that that attitude was taken by prominent Members of most parties. It was never intended to register a vote for disarmament. I think it is unfortunate that such a statement, which was put about for party purposes, should be repeated now.
