(by Private Notice) asked the Minister of Works whether he has any statement to make about the removal of the statue of General Gordon from its place in Trafalgar Square?
I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the concluding sentence of his reply. Might I submit to him that this is a question to which considerable sentimental importance attaches? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that General Gordon was not only a military commander, who gave his life for his country, but, in addition, was considered very widely throughout this country as a model of a Christian hero, and that very many cherished ideals are associated with his name? Would not the right hon. Gentleman consider whether this statue, which, I am told, is a very fine work of art, might not receive special consideration, even though the monuments to some famous admirals were put in some different place? General Gordon was a figure outside and above the ranks of military and naval commanders.
