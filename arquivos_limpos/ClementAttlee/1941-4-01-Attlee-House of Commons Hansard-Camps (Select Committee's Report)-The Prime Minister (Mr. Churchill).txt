In the opinion of His Majesty's Government the criticisms and recommendations of the Select Committee do not support the contentions of my hon. Friend, and I am not prepared to adopt the course of action he suggests. I may add that the Minister of Works and Buildings is now considering the Report in detail, with a view to taking the necessary steps, wherever practical, to give effect to the Committee's recommendations, some of which have already been adopted, and the Minister's observations on the Report generally will in due course be submitted to the Select Committee.
