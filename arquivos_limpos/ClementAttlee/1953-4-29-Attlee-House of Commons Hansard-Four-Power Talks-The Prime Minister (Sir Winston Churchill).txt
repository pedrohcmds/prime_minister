I have read the editorial which appeared in "Pravda" on 25th of April. I should be very glad to learn that informal talks could be held at the highest level and that they would lead to "serious businesslike discussions." I may be able to deal with these issues more fully in a debate on foreign affairs in the near future. I do not wish to anticipate any statement which I may make on that occasion.
