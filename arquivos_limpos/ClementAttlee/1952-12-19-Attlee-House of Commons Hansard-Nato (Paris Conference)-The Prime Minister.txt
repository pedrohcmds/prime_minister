As to the last part of the question, I can certainly give that assurance. As to the more general issues involved, it is quite clear that these matters have to be fully discussed when we meet again, but certainly no justice could be done to topics of such wide scope and variegated character in the closing hours of the Session.
The right hon. Gentleman's suggestion is helpful, and when the Minister of Defence and the Foreign Secretary return later in the day, I will represent the matter to them so that a statement can be carefully prepared over a few days which will give the full effect, as we see it now, of what has occurred as far as it can be made public, and so that that should be brought out before we meet againâ€”if not before Christmas, immediately afterwards.
The matter is one which affects not only the Foreign Office but, indeed, in bulk the Ministry of Defence; but I will give my personal attention to the matter in order that a full statement can be laid before the House, which can be meditated upon and which we can debate at the first convenient opportunity when we return.
If a White Paper is issued, I see no reason why we should not have a map, but I will see whether that is necessary and whether it would warrant the additional expense involved.
