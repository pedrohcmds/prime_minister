Oh, well, the hon. Member for Orpington is still well back in the 19th century.
The right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong, because he has not taken the trouble to follow the course of events. We were well aware of a certain trend, and I may say that the late Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a very full account of it at the Mansion House. We saw that trend and we stated what that trend was. If the right hon. Gentleman did realise it was serious, it is all the worse that he and his friends went round making optimistic speeches. If the right hon. Gentleman did know, why did he allow Lord Woolton to go round the country?
Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman does not know what the position was in 1945 that we had to face.
What I said wasâ€”and here is a quotation from the "Manchester Guardian": "The Economic situation is serious." That is exactly contrary to what the right hon. Gentleman said that I said. I did say so. I pointed that out.
The Prime Minister does not dissolve Parliament. He only gives advice on it.
Does the hon. Gentleman think, then, that when a Prime Minister goes to the country he is evading responsibility or seeking responsibility? I did exactly the same as the right hon. Gentleman opposite did in 1945. He went to seek a mandate from the country to deal with a difficult situation.
And at the first moment of it the hon. Gentleman's right hon. Friend said we must have a decision from the country and not go on with eternal bickering and a small majority; and, when I accepted what the right hon. Gentleman wanted, the hon. Gentleman now says I ought not to have done it.
