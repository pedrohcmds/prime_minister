Are we to understand that in this matter the right hon. Gentleman derived his information from the Secretary of State for War?
How can the right hon. Gentleman explain the fact that the Secretary of State for War had handed out, both from the War Office and, I understand, locally, a textual report, which is confirmed by the Press Association, who took it down, in which the passage referring to the plot, as actually delivered by the Secretary of State for War, was as follows: 

On what grounds can the Prime Minister dissociate the word"plot" from"these schemes" and the Schuman scheme, which was the one before us? May I earnestly hope that we shall have better treatment from the Prime Minister, on a matter of this very important personal kind, than we have received so far?
What did the right hon. Gentleman say?
If that be so, does not the text of the document, supplied beforehand on the authority of the Secretary of State for War to the Press, show that he completely misled the Prime Minister, and that this led the Prime Minister to mislead the House?
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he will not go into this matter more in detail and examine carefully the text which the Secretary of State followed in his speech, and give, if I may say so, a candid and true opinion as to whether the mere assertion by the right hon. Gentleman, contrary to the text, that the word"plot" did not refer to the Schuman scheme, cannot in any way be possibly sustained?
What proposal?
Exactly.
is not the essential point whether the word"plot" covered the Schuman proposal? What other proposals were there before the public at the time, except the Schuman proposal we had just been debating? Surely the right hon. Gentleman will consider his own position very carefully in this matter.
