This particular publication is one of a series which gives accounts, which I believe are of great interest to the public, of the different campaigns. The passages referring to particular changes of command were not written in any controversial style and do not, in my opinion, in any way alter the answer I gave against publication of despatches in time of war. They do not reflect upon the officers concerned in any manner which would require any further official statement. Of course, if I were pressed to make a further statement, I should be ready to state the reasons why I made certain changes, but I should deprecate it, in the interests of all concerned.
Yes, Sir, certainly, Despatches are referred to the Defence Committee and are otherwise examined, but we are not making a practice of publishing them at the present time. As to this booklet, which was written by the War Office, I had not myself seen it until attention was drawn to it by this Question, but, as I say, it is one of a series of an  informative character. I do not consider that it reflects upon the officers concerned in any manner which would require a special departure from the practice we have adopted.
Certainly; of course they will be published. I have not actually re-read them but I have looked through them, since this Question was put on the Paper. They are extremely lengthy, and I am not sure that they do throw very much light upon the position of these particular officers.
I do not think the Government are responsible for anything in these particular publications.
