I should not like to go into this matter, but I am quite sure that German criminals have no right to escape merely by suddenly embracing the Communist faith.
I really could write quite a short brochure on the subject.
I think it is not at all helpful or useful to put a number of complicated hypothetical questions on these matters. I think we had better get on with our work.
