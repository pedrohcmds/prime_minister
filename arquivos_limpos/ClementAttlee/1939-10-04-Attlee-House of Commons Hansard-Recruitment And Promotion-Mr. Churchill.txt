We do not attempt to draw the slightest distinction of public status or of honour between the age groups and the volunteers, but in computing the share which the Navy have of the age groups, the volunteers who like the life on the sea will be given the preference, and as there are a great many of these, the question will be one of picking them out.
I am naturally dealing with war time promotions at the moment, but we have to deal with the regular services of the Royal Navy, and I do not  propose for a moment that the 75 should be the maximum. I intend it to be the minimum, but, of course, we have to consider the number of officers who will be on our staff after the war is over.
Commissions to the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve will depend upon the Royal Naval Supplementary Reserve through whom they pass.
