May I ask you, Sir, whether you have anything to add to the statement which you made yesterday concerning HANSARD and the OFFICIAL REPORT?
Your explanation, Mr. Speaker, makes matters very clear. I should like to say we all have great confidence in HANSARD. Its early publication is an immense convenience to Members, who are glad that there is, as it were, a further check, in case large questions of law are involved.
