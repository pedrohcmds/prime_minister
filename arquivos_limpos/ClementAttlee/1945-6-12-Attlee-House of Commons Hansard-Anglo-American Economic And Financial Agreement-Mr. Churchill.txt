rose—
I was about to ask you, Sir, on a point of Order, whether I am not entitled to put a further question to the Leader of the House on the Business statement which he has made?
I would like to ask the Leader of the House whether We may take it that, in regard to the outline of Business for next week, in connection with the statement made by the Prime Minister—a suggested outline but one which will, of course, be interpreted in accordance with the general wishes and desires of the House—if more time is required, we shall not be held to be agreeing at this moment to the allocation that has been proposed.
On Business, it is always possible for the House to sit Saturday, Sunday or Christmas Day if we need extra days, and feel that our duty cannot be discharged without those extra days. If the House decides, it is fully in our power.
I hope, before the question is answered, the right hon. Gentleman will not deny us the opportunity of an interval for consideration of these tangled matters before we come to a decision.
