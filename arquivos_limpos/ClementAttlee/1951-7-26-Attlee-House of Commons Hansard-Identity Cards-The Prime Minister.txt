No. Sir. This matter like emergency legislation generally is already kept under review.
Obviously, where this card is used by a particular Department, the Departmental Minister is responsible, but the general matter is, naturally, considered by Ministers acting together.
I cannot connect that supplementary with the Question which has been asked.
I am not taking a conservative view, but this is a matter which requires great consideration. There are a number of occasions on which the use of this card saves the general public a great deal of trouble. The matter has to be reviewed very carefully.
That matter concerns passports and perhaps my hon. Friend had better put a Question down to the Foreign Office.
I think it is very likely.
