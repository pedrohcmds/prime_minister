May I ask the Leader of the House a question on a matter of business, which has some urgency? As he is aware, a debate took place on the Motion for the Adjournment on 15th November, when the hon. Member for Luton (Dr. Hill) raised the question of the decision of the Durham County Council to dismiss any employees who were not members of a trade union. In reply, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health indicated that he would draw the attention of the council to a Ministry of Health circular issued by this  Department which was in conflict with this decision. It is now reported that the Durham County Council intend to adhere to their decision. This raises the urgent question of whether the employees of the Durham County Council may not be, at this moment, under pressure to join a union against their will. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman when we can have a statement on this question?
Perhaps, however, a little later, we can raise the question whether the matter should not be discussed in the House at some convenient opportunity. Naturally, we are not discontented with the course the Government have taken.
