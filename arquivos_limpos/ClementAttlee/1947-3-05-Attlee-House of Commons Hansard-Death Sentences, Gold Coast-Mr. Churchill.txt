I apologise to the House. I was not aware that this matter was to be raised, and I did not hear the opening discussion. I presume that it is understood on all sides that these men will not be executed until there has been a further Debate in this House.
I should like to know what is the answer to my question. I have ventured to put this point, that people ought not to be brought up to execution, or believe that they are to be executed, time after time whether innocent or guilty, however it may be, whatever their crime. That is a wrong thing, and I trust we shall have an opportunity  of testifying in that matter before an irrevocable act is committed.
