Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman satisfied in his own mind that this perfectly unintentional typographical error into which he fell did not exert an influence upon the decision which the House took on Tuesday last when it allowed the writ to pass?
May we assume that the learned Attorney-General will take special care to avoid repetition of errors so serious that they can confuse nine days with 49 days—[HON. MEMBERS: "Thirty-nine days."]—when majorities are so uncertain and when a balance on that sort of point might sometimes count?
