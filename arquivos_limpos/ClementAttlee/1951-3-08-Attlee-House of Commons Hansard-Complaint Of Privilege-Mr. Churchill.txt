Do I understand you to say, Mr. Speaker, that you would be glad if the Motion to refer this matter to a Committee of Privileges could be adjourned?
I am very glad indeed to receive your Ruling. It is a matter for the House to decide, no doubt after  debate and if necessary after a Division, whether this matter should be proceeded with immediately or not.
I am only endeavouring to ascertain what the Rule is on the matter. If the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne moved a Motion it would be open to anyone else to move that the debate should be adjourned in order that the House may decide.
I wish to follow the line you have indicated, Mr. Speaker. I beg to move, "That the debate be now adjourned."
Another point which seems to me to make it important that the debate should be adjourned and that the House should consider precedents before they submit the complaint to the Committee of Privileges is that a member of another place is involved. The Right Reverend Bishop of Rochester is a peer. Surely it would be only reasonable and decorous for us to be sure that we had not in any way infringed the privileges of another place before we decide offhand to remit the matter to the Committee of Privileges in which the conduct of a member of another place will be directly involved.
I can only speak again with the indulgence of the House. I would point out that there are many precedents for matters of Privilege having been discussed in the House before being remitted to the Committee of Privileges.
I shall be quite willing to withdraw the Motion for the adjournment of the matter on the understanding that the Motion of the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) is also withdrawn. Then, Mr. Speaker, we shall await your Ruling on the subject.
