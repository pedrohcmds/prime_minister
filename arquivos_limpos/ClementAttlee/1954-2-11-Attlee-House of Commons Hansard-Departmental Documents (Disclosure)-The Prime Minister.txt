We have discussed that matter in relation to the actual occurrence. As I said, we were accused of what is a very grave offenceâ€”the shameful betrayal of the vital interests of the British soldier. In those circumstances, it certainly was interesting to see that in the past this matter had been discussed on very even conditions without any of these formidable accusations being associated with it in any way. But, as I have said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War tells me that he wished he had had the time and the opportunity to draw the attention of the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) to it. Certainly, it would have been advantageous because he might have persuaded his neighbour, the hon. Member for Aston (Mr. Wyatt) not to cast the Motion in such a deeply dyed depth of villainy.
I am certainly very content with the treatment which was meted out to me during seven or eight long years of opposition. I am not aware of having departed in any way from the general method of conducting our affairs which was maintained by the party opposite. I earnestly hope that nothing we shall do in our tenure will lead us to fall below the standard which was set.
No. I think the matter is very well grasped by the House and set in its proper poise and balance.
