rose—
On a point of order. We cannot hear a word. Mr. Speaker, might I ask you to intercede with the Prime Minister to read this statement a little less rapidly and a little more plainly?
Was it at all necessary for the Minister of Defence, who is by way of animating the general effort and sacrifice required from this country demanded by the Government, to make a statement of this character at this moment; and does the Prime Minister associate himself with that statement or not?
The actual words that the Prime Minister has to deal with are: 
What precautions are taken to make sure that this slight sign, if any, that is given is not a means of deceiving the Allies?
rose—
Does the Prime Minister not consider that this particular statement which has been made is likely to weaken the efforts which are being made at his request, and the request of His Majesty's Government, throughout the country, by people of all parties to sustain and develop the defences of the country; and does he not think he would be better employing his power and authority to get some discipline and order among his principal Ministers—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—than in flinging across the House insulting insinuations that the party on this side of the House is not as devoted to peace as he is?
