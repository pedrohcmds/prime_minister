Will the right hon. Gentleman give the reply to the second part of the Question?
The House, I am sure, will defer to the wish of the Foreign Secre-  tary that this matter should not be carried further at this moment, and I should like to thank him for the full, calm and factual statement which he has made. May I ask the Leader of the House whether he will consider, in discussion with the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, when it will be convenient to have a Debate on Foreign Affairs, which has become necessary, although, naturally, the opportunity must be carefully selected.
