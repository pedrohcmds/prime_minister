May I express, on behalf I think of the whole House, the satisfaction with which we have learnt of the decision of His Majesty's Government and of the Foreign Secretary to hold this conference in Moscow and of his resolve to  proceed there himself? I personally think it would be a very grievous thing if impediments grew up in the way of meetings of what have been called the Big Three—the three major Powers—because, although we all want much larger organ isms to come into being, without the agreement and accord of the three major Powers there may well be an obstacle to all future development. I, therefore, wish to compliment the Foreign Secretary on his resolve to go, and to wish him the greatest possible success in his mission. These personal contacts are of very great value and I trust that they will, in this case, result in the settlement of a great many difficult points and also in the re building of the sympathy and good will between the three major Powers without which we should never have got to this satisfactory conclusion.
