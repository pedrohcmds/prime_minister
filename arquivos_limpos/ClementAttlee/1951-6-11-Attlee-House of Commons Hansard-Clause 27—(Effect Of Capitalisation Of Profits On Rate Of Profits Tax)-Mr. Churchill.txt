This frivolous performance gave me the strange impression, perhaps not altogether inappropriate to the hour at which we are sitting, that we were listening to a sleep-talker. I would ask the Leader of the House to reply to the request that has been formally made to him by my right hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton).
Might not the House have been informed of that fact before the decision was taken, because it certainly might have made a difference to the decision if the machinery of the House has broken down under the strain put upon it?—[Interruption.]—On a point of order, might I ask the Minister whether we could be informed what time it was known that this was broken down? Is it not rather a serious matter that Members should not have the bells ringing in the regular way?
I should be very churlish if I did not make my acknowledgment to you, Major Milner.
