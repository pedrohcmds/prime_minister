It was arranged last February for Her Royal Highness to visit British Forces in Germany, in particular the members and families of regiments of which she is colonel-in-chief. The detailed arrangements were made by the Service Departments. It was natural that the President of the Federal Republic should receive and honour Her Royal Highness and arrangements in this connection were made through the Foreign Office.
