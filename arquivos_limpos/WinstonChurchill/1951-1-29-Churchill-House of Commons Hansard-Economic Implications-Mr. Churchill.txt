We are all obliged to the Prime Minister for the terse and evidently deeply considered statement which he has made to the House upon these grave issues. Needless to say this is not the time for us to debate them. I hope that an opportunity may be found not even next week but the week after for a debate upon this subject of defence, which should have at least two, perhaps three, days' discussion. We must all do our best to measure these matters as carefully as we can in the interval.
As there have been so many questions on a subject we are not proposing to debate for a certain number of days, I should not like the conversation to be closed without giving the Prime Minister the assurance that these proposals will be examined with fidelity, candour and good will by us. We shall speak our minds upon them with no other thought but what is the best method of securing the safety of our endangered country.
