Would it not be a matter of very great convenience to have a common copper coin which took the place of the old ld., even though we have to pay much more for it, and which we should at any rate want available for an enormous number of basic transactions—a myriad of basic transactions—which are of great common useage amongst the masses of the people? Surely that ought to be considered. The ld. now really does not cover anything that we are confronted with under the present dispensation.
I was not speaking at all about decimal coinage—that is another  question altogether. The idea is that a coin should be made which takes the place of the penny, which, since the end of the war, has ceased to play its normal, natural and, I believe, necessary part in the ordinary life and transactions of the great mass of the people.
Surely the coins in common usage ought to bear an effective relation to the value of money?
