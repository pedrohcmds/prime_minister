What does my right hon. Friend mean by "structural protection"?
Does that include the strengthening of basements?
Can my right hon. Friend say what has been done in this matter in London up to the presentâ€” actually done? Are large areas surveyed, and are a great number of basements furnished, with approved plans and so forth?
Could my right hon. Friend indicate the type of projectile that he has in his mind against which underground protection should be provided?
Not an arm our-piercing bomb?
How many could he carry over?
My right hon. Friend used the expression "all over the country." Is this question of shelters to be judged by whether it can be applied all over the country, or applied only in the target areas?
Do they need them in Little Peddlington?
