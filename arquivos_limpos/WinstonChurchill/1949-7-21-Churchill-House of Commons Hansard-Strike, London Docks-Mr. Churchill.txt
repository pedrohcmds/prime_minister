Surely the British writ runs in the British Isles, and citizens from other parts of the Empire have to conform to the laws of the mother country, just as our people conform to their laws when they are abroad? Could the right hon. Gentleman explain what he meant yesterday when he said that if he had the power to deal with a few individuals he could bring the strike to an end at once? Why not tell us what it is he wants, because Parliament will not deny the necessary powers when a good case has been made.
Does the right hon. Gentleman mean to suggest that after all these weeks in which he has been engaged in intimate study of this matter, he is not effectively informed on this simple point which has been put to him?
Is the Home Secretary himself, then, not able to answer the question which his colleague has referred to him?
