The initiation of this project took place before I had to assume the burden of responsibility for public affairs.
I really think that is not a matter which particularly affects the present Administration. We followed  the course which was being pursued, I think a beneficial course, a very right and proper course. I am by no means sure on the spur of the moment that the Minister of Defence, among other Departments, was not consulted in the final stages.
I think I might have notice of that question.
A great deal of material is published here and also abroad on these delicate matters, on disputable matters, and it was thought right by the late Administration—and we fully share their views—that a truthful and substantive account of what had taken place should be put out in the form and manner which has been described. I must say that in Alan Moorehead—who I understand was at one time publicity officer to the Ministry of Defence—one could hardly have had a more trustworthy author.
