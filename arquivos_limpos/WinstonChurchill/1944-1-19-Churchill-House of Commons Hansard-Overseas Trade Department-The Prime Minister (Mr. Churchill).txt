I would refer my hon. Friend to the full statement on this subject which my right hon. Friend the Secretary to the Overseas Trade Department made in the course of the Debate on Overseas Trade on 27th July last, and also in reply to a Question by my hon. Friend, the Member for West Birmingham (Mr. Higgs) on 16th December last. To these I have at the moment nothing to add.
