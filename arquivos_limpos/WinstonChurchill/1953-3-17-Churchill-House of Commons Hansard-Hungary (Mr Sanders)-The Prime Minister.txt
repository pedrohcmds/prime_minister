The answer to the second part of the hon. Gentleman's supplementary question is in the affirmative. We shall continue to persevere, but I do not think I ought to take up the time of the House in dealing at length with arguments as to the balance of reasons which have led us to take our decision.
As I say, I do not feel that Question time is the opportunity for dealing at length with questions of this kind, on which, quite naturally, opinions may differ. I should really be standing in the way of other hon. Members who have put down Questions on the Paper.
The hon. Gentleman is well informed about the procedure of the House of Commons.
I do not think I could undertake to do that without an opportunity afforded for debate.
As is, I think, well known, very severe curtailments have been made in the trade between Hungary and this country, which are costly to us, but are also, I believe, effectively severe upon Hungary. That is at work at the present time. If there are other methods by which pressure can be brought upon them, they will certainly be carefully studied.
