I cannot, without notice, say what arrangements took place in the tests in the Pacific; but at any rate it would not affect the substance of the answer I have just given to my hon. Friend.
I am very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for refreshing my memory upon this matter, and indeed furnishing me with information, but I have nothing to add to what I said.
I should be very much obliged for any assistance of that character.
In view of the fact that important experiments are to be made in the autumn of this year, I have felt that this is not the appropriate moment to make radical changes in the existing arrangements or to create a new organisation on a long-term basis. It has therefore been decided to make no change for the present in the statutory responsibility of the Minister of Supply in regard to atomic energy. As indicated, however, in my reply of 15th November, to the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Philips Price), the Paymaster-General will continue to advise me on atomic energy questions and to exercise general supervision over work in this field.
A very wise one? I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his compliment, which is also a compliment to himself.
