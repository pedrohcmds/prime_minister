No, Sir. There have been important changes in the constitutional relations between the various parts of the Commonwealth since the Committee of Imperial Defence was established in 1904; and in the conditions of today other methods of Commonwealth  consultation and co-operation in defence are more effective and appropriate.
There was an occasion, or a period, in which there was a Leader of the Opposition on it, but if the hon. Gentleman will study the composition of the Committee of Imperial Defence, he will see that it is not really very suited to present conditions, especially from the point of view of Imperial co-operation.
That is quite right. I think he was only a Member of the Opposition. He was not Leader.
