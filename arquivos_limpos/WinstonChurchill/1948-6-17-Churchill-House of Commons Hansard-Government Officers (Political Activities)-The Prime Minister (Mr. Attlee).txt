Civil servants are expected to maintain a reserve in political matters and not to put themselves forward prominently on one side or the other. They are required to resign as soon as they issue an address to electors or in any other manner announce themselves as Parliamentary candidates. A committee is at present considering whether any change is necessary in the existing limitations on the political activities of civil servants.
