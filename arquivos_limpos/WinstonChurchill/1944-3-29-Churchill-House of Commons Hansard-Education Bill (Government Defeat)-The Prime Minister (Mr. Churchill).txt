The event of yesterday requires an alteration in Government Business. It would not be possible for His Majesty's Government to leave matters where they stood when the Motion to report Progress was accepted. At this very serious time in the progress of the war, there must be no doubt or question of the support which the Government enjoy in the House of Commons. Accordingly we have decided, as the first Business on the next Sitting Day, to resume the Committee stage of the Education Bill, and to delete Clause 82, as amended, entirely from the Measure. This act of deletion will be regarded as a Vote of Confidence in the present Administration. If the Government do not secure an adequate majority, it will entail the usual constitutional consequences. Should the House agree to the deletion of the Clause, the Government propose to move to reinstate the original Clause, without the Amendment, on the Report stage, and to treat its passage throughout as a matter of confidence.
