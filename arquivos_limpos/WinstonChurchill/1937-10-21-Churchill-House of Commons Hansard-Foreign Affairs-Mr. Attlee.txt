The Foreign Secretary in his closing sentences expressed a desire for a unity of attitude in this country on foreign affairs, but the speech which he has just delivered has widened the gulf which existed between this party and the party opposite. I have heard a number of speeches by the right hon. Gentleman, but I have never heard such a cynical pronouncement as that which he has just made. In his earlier speeches in this House he used to uphold the ideal of the League of Nations and the ideal of the rule of law. He seemed to have some idea that there should be at least a distinction between right and wrong in foreign affairs. Throughout this speech he has emphasised all the time that the only thing which affects His Majesty's Government is the interests of British Imperialism. He has emphasised that it  is the only thing on which a risk should be taken. By doing so, he has illustrated very clearly the entire difference in outlook between the Government and the Members of this party. I want to develop that point a little later, and I shall show how, in every sphere of foreign politics on which he has touched, that prime difference comes out that this party stands for the rule of law and for the development of a commonwealth of nations, and that the Government are back in pre-war days, considering only, and narrowly, what they consider—I believe quite falsely—to be the interests of this country.
I am very glad to have that assurance. I sent a message to the right hon. Gentleman which I hope reached him, asking him to deal with this subject in his speech. I hope that this will be done for the women and children, despite any opposition from General Franco, because the slaughter of women and children is not a legitimate act of war. In the same way, there is the question of the surrender of troops, and whether they can be taken to be unarmed in order to save their lives. If there were a land frontier, the troops could reach it and be interned, as happened in Holland in the later days of the War but in this case they are faced with the sea. The fact is that there is a danger that the whole of these brave men may he slaughtered because it happens to be a sea front and not a land front. Here, again, I believe it is of the utmost importance that our Government, in conjunction with other Governments, should do the utmost to save these people, not only because of the people themselves, but to prevent the exacerbation of the whole civil war position in Spain. A civil war is a horrible one at any time, but if an atrocity of this kind takes place it might lead to other  atrocities. I am sure the Valencia Government will do all they can to stop it, but they will have this terrible exacerbation of strife, and I do ask that our Government should show as much resolution when they are dealing with a question of humanity as they would for the interests of British shipping.
—which has helped to make the strength of Russia. I do not think he has realised the strength of the national feeling in Spain any more than he realised the strength of the national feeling in India, and I do not think he realises yet the national feeling in China. But I think we ought to recognise here and now that you can have no possible  judgment between the combatants in Spain until there has been a complete withdrawal of foreign troops.
I think the place to make statements is in this House. I made the same speech twice in Trafalgar Square as I made here. I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the attitude of the United States is of the very first importance, and the fact that they are going to meet with us in this Nine-Power Conference is of vital importance. I believe this adventure of Japan's is only undertaken because of the attitude of this and other Governments in always letting the aggressors get away with it. I believe there is great opposition in Japan. Japan's financial position is extremely weak and Japan's economic position is extremely weak. If one tithe of the consideration which is shown about British shipping in the Mediterranean was shown about the Japanese invasion of China, I believe this invasion would stop. This is a deliberate piece of aggression by one Power against another, and all through the Government wash their hands of the matter. Either they say "it is a matter in which we cannot take sides" or else, as was hinted in a speech by the Foreign Secretary, "we are too weak to do anything."
That is just the weakness of the right hon. Gentleman. He always believes any kind of propaganda that is put out against us. Japan also says that she is out for peace. Does he believe that? I do not believe for a moment that Japan would challenge the world. The world has given its verdict at Geneva. A verdict like that, followed by no action, is perfectly useless. The Prime Minister has said that the question involved is the sanctity of treaties, but the Government has torn up a number of treaties. So far from this Government having brought this country into safety and security, I believe it has jeopardised our security, and the right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong when he believes there is any kind of unity behind this Government. There will be no unity behind this Government so long as it pursues a policy which is entirely divorced from the realities of the situation, entirely divorced from any idea of collective security and the rule of law, and is directed only by a short-sighted view of Imperial interests. We can assure him that he will meet with opposition from this side so long as he and his Government pursue the kind of policy they have pursued over the last five years.
That was not stated in the Italian Note. Is the Commission to go on and make arrangements for a total withdrawal? The Italian suggestion was that first there should be a withdrawal of man for man on each side, and what I was asking was what would be the  amount, because if I am correct, or if the general reports are correct, there are four or five times as many on the rebel side as on the Government side.
That is exactly what my point was—what kind of amount is meant by a token withdrawal.
I suggested there were certain technicalities with regard to territorial waters that had not been objected to when it was a question of rescuing Franco, but which were said to be standing in the way of rescuing the supporters of the Government.
