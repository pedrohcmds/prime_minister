It is very difficult indeed. I felt there was a good deal of force in the suggestion made, but when you come to apply it is is very difficult, because some of the matters touch tremendous secrets which are being actively examined at this time, and it is not possible to come into consultation with outsiders about them. There are many difficulties of that kind. We are most anxious to examine any suggestions of a reasonable character, and a good many that come from the public can be attended to by the Department to which they are sent or transferred to the proper Department. If there is no particular Department, there is always the Lord President of the Council's general committee of scientific research, and application to him will be attended to.
