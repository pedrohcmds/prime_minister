How many copies of this volume containing these 60 additional pages would it be necessary to print in order to give the information? Why should the names of new factories not be made public? What is the secrecy about it?
When we are asked to pass legislation in order to produce enormous census of production returns and details of all kinds in every direction, why should not these broad, simple, practical facts be made known?
Why could not the 60 pages containing information of new factories be published once, and then merely additions published weekly after that? What have the Government to hide in this matter?
May I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should jettison some of this exceptional modesty, and let us have the simple facts for which we ask?
Am I right in assuming, at the end of this colloquy, that the Minister is going to consider—[Horn. MEMBERS: "No."]—yes, he said so. Is he going to consider the giving of this simple information?
Thank you very much.
