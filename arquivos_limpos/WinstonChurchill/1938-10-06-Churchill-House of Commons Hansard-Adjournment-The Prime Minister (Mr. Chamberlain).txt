It will be remembered that the original plea of the Leader of the Opposition was that Parliament should continue to sit and that it was based on four considerations which he put to me. I gave him an answer to those four questions. It was to the effect that I did not think any of them could reasonably be discussed in the immediate present. The request to-day has been put to me on entirely different grounds. Let me say first of all that I have not asked that the House should rise now and not sit again till 1st November on the plea that I wanted a rest. I am not so exhausted that I cannot carry out my duties, whatever they may be. I do not pretend that I am not as fond of a holiday as anyone else. But on this matter, this suggestion that in the next fortnight or three weeks something might happen which is of importance and which this House should have an opportunity of speaking its mind upon—upon that hypothesis I do ask hon. Members to look at the terms of the Motion. The Motion provides for the usual procedure, under which the House can be summoned by Mr. Speaker to meet again if such a situation should arise.
