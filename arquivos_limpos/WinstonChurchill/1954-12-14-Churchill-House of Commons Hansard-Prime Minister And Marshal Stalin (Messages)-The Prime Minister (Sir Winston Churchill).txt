The text of the telegram which I sent to Marshal Stalin on 6th January, 1945, asking whether we could count on a major Russian offensive during January, 1945, has already been published, with the reply and my further message of 9th January, on pages 243 and 244 of my Volume VI of "The Second World War." The Russians opened an offensive in January, as Marshal Stalin had said in his message they would, and I am arranging for the further message on this subject which I sent to Marshal Stalin on 16th January, not hitherto published, to be circulated in the OFFICIAL REPORT.
