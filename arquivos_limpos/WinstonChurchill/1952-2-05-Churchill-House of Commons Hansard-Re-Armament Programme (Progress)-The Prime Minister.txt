It is hardly a question of admission on my part. This was a set of decisions, with which I do not in principle disagree, left us by our predecessors. I may say that I have heard it reported that the re-armament programme of £4,700 million agreed to by the late Government would now probably cost something in the neighbour-hood of £5,200 million owing to the ever-increasing lack of purchasing power of the £ sterling, and that is a factor to be taken into consideration. We shall do our best to meet all these difficulties.
There does not seem to be any difference between us on this point.
We are pushing ahead to the best of our ability, but it is not possible to say exactly what delays  will be involved. Undoubtedly, there is a certain lag, and we shall do our very utmost to limit that as much as possible.
I think the hon. Gentleman would do well, if I might make a suggestion, to discuss this matter with the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan), who was, I believe, responsible at the time when the proposal to spend £4,700 million in three years was proposed.
I think that is entirely irrelevant to the Question that is now asked me, but I will certainly devote my attention to it if the right hon. Gentleman will put down a Question.
We are all deeply interested—
Mr. Speaker, may I have a ruling from you as to which of the two right hon. competitors I am to reply to?
To the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) I say that I can quite understand his conscientious anxieties about the course he took. I am sure he will receive the most charitable consideration from the House in any exposition which the Rules of Order permit him to make.
