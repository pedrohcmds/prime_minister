It is rather difficult to follow exactly in detail the full statement which the right hon. Gentleman has made without having the documents referred to paragraph by paragraph before us, and it is not very clear, from what we have heard, what the whole of this statement amounts to. But I presume we are right in assuming that the representatives of His Majesty's Government will vote with the United States on the resolution declaring China to be an aggressor in North Korea—[Interruption]—I am only asking. I would like to know—and that this agreement will be maintained, though after a great deal of discussion, with the United States on these cardinal issues? If that is so we are very glad indeed, and we are particularly relieved to feel that no breach between Great  Britain and the United States, even though concerned with a tangle of words, would occur at such a grave juncture in our joint fortunes.
