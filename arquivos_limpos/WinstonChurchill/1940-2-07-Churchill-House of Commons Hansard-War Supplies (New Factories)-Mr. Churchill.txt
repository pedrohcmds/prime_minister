As was stated in reply to my hon. Friend's Question on 23rd January, every consideration will continue to be given to the North-Eastern Area when new Admiralty factories are to be built. Before a new Admiralty factory is established the Ministry of Labour and National Service is consulted in order to ensure both that the requisite labour will be available and that the claims of areas with a high degree of unemployment are given due weight in deciding upon the site.
Virtually even/body will be drawn in.
