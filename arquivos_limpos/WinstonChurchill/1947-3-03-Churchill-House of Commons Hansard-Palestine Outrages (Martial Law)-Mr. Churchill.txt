(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make on the latest outrage in Palestine.
Why is it that the measures now proposed to be taken are likely to be more effective than other measures which have been taken at various times in the last 12 months following on similar outrages?
How long does the Secretary of State for the Colonies expect that this state of squalid warfare with all its bloodshed will go on, at a cost of £30 million or £40 million a year, keeping 100,000 Englishmen away with the military forces? How long does he expect that this will go on before some decision is reached?
How long is this to go on? Is there no means of accelerating the appeal to the United Nations organisa-  tion, or are we just to drift on month after month, with these horrible outrages and counter-measures which are most necessary but none the less objectionable—necessary but painful? Can nothing be done to accelerate the appeal to the United Nations organisation?
When does the Minister expect to be in a position to announce that the United Nations will be able to give prompt attention to this urgent matter? When?
If I ask a Question in about a week—
—or perhaps even the Prime Minister might do his best to answer it.
