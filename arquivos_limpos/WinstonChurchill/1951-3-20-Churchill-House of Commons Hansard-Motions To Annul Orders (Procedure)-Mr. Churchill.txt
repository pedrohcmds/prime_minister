May I ask the Leader of the House what steps he proposes to take as a result of his intervention last night on the question of Prayers?
With great respect to the usual channels—that valuable institution—might I ask the right hon. Gentleman how it was that the usual channels were not informed beforehand of his intention to make a statement of that character late last night; and how it was that full information was given to all his supporters, including the Prime Minister and others, whereas the Conservative Party, and I believe the Liberal Party, were not at all informed that any statement of that kind was to be made? Having regard to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman's statement was intended to be of a conciliatory or deprecatory character, surely it would have been better to extend the usual courtesies.
Are they not the right hon. Gentleman's friends?
I am all against cruelty to animals, whether we are talking of hares or rabbits. But may I say to the right hon. Gentleman that I am not at all sure that ordinary discussion through the usual channels will deal with the matter of grave constitutional importance which he has raised. I think it would be better if the discussion took place between himself and me; or himself and some other colleague, and me and another colleague. I do not consider that this is a matter for settlement, as it were, through the two Whips' rooms, excellent and admirable as are their representatives on  both sides. But of course I should be quite ready to receive the right hon. Gentleman—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—my room is on the ground floor anyhow. If there is any point to be made of it we could, of course, meet on neutral ground—accompanied by seconds—to have a discussion on this matter. Certainly it would be very wrong that anybody on either side should refrain from or refuse fully to discuss these matters. Perhaps the point of how, and where and when such a discussion should take place might well be relegated to the usual channels; while the merits and the general decision must be done on a different—I must not say higher—but a different level from that.
I hope I shall get the reasonable fair play we expect on this side of the House—[HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."]—I have no intention of withdrawing. Hon. Gentlemen really make a great mistake in thinking they can intimidate me. I know what my rights are. I have the greatest respect for the Chair—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—and I believe that I shall be accorded the rights which anybody else in my position would have been accorded in former Parliaments. I ask, is not it an obstacle to the beginning of these talks—I quite agree I should put it in interrogative form—that a threat should be used of maltreating, contrary to the merits of their cases, the traders of many different classes in this country as a means of putting pressure on Members of the House of Commons to refuse them their Parliamentary rights and privileges long established by practice and custom of this House? And how does the right hon. Gentleman reconcile such a situation—I am asking  the question—with the proposal for friendly conversations—personally friendly and on general grounds I trust—which the right hon. Gentleman has come to us asking us to begin?
I feel great difficulty in these meetings beginning until the threat—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—of the President of the Board of Trade, as I said, to subject to great hardship large and important sections of manufacturers and others in the country, by denying them their rights and treating them severely, is withdrawn. I do not propose that we should enter into any conversations of a friendly character—[Interruption.]—I do not fear hon. Gentlemen opposite half as much as they fear their fellow countrymen. I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether we can have a withdrawal by the President of the Board of Trade as a prelude to this conversation——
This is really a serious matter. [Interruption.] Is not this really a serious matter, and would it not be a great disadvantage to the House if the possibilities of friendly personal contact came to an end? May I hope that I shall hear from the right hon. Gentleman in the course of the afternoon—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO."]—that I shall hear from him before he expects me to meet him, with or without companions? I hope I shall hear from him that the President of the Board of Trade has withdrawn his threat.
May I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I could not have expected a more decent answer than the one he has given—nor did I. I shall await any further communication he has to make to me.
