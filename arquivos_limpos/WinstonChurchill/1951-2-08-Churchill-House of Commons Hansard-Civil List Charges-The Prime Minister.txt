No, Sir. The charge on the Consolidated Fund fixed by the Civil List Act of 1937 has remained unchanged, but the increase in the cost of wages, goods and services provided from the Civil List has resulted in deficits in recent years, causing heavy demands upon His Majesty's Privy Purse, which have been met by His Majesty from savings accumulated during the war. These savings are now exhausted and His Majesty's Government have decided as from 1st April, 1951, to relieve the Civil List of the cost of certain services.
