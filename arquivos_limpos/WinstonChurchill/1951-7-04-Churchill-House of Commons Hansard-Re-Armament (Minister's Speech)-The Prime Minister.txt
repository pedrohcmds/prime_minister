I think the right hon. Gentleman might wait until I have concluded my reply.
I will read the answer again.
It is, of course, very easy to pull a phrase or two from a speech. My right hon. Friend was explaining the necessity for our defences,  and for increasing the defences of the freedom loving nations. It is perfectly relevant to suggest to people that our whole end is peace and that we do not want to spend all our efforts in piling up armaments. I would say that, when there is a genuine acceptance of the need for peace and genuine co-operation by others, we shall certainly join in. I think that it was a perfectly reasonable and sensible thing to say.
I do not think there is any danger of that. Of course, it is easy to be meticulous about phrases. I could be meticulous about other people's phrases. The general tenor of my right hon. Friend's remarks is perfectly clear.
I do not agree with what the hon. Gentleman says. I think that the policy of the Government is perfectly clear.
It has been fully expressed, and was expressed in this speech. It really is doing an ill-service by taking one phrase from a considerable speech to try to impugn the motives of a Minister.
The statements made by the President and myself are perfectly clear on that point. We want strength, but we also want peace.
I have flung no insinuations across the House. I do not think that anyone thinks so but the right hon. Gentleman. I flung no insinuations. I was pointing out, and I thought the right hon. Gentleman agreed, that we are increasing our defences for the purpose of preserving peace. I think that a statement of this kind is quite useful, because there are people who think that because we are piling up defences we are solely interested in piling up defences to make war. It is just as well to counter that kind of propaganda.
