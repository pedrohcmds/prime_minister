In the earlier years of the war there was very good reason, on security grounds, against disclosing our food stock figures. In view of the present military position that objection no longer holds. I read in the newspapers that there is an impression in some quarters in the United States that our stocks in Great Britain amount to 700,000,000 tons. Actually they are now rather less than 6,000,000 tons. They are in process of being reduced, by aid to the liberated countries, to about 4,750,000 tons by the end of June. This latter figure is no more than is necessary to maintain a regular flow of distribution under present conditions. I thought it was worth while mentioning these facts about our stocks of food, which have been built up by foresight and self-denial over five years of strict rationing and frequent bombardment.
