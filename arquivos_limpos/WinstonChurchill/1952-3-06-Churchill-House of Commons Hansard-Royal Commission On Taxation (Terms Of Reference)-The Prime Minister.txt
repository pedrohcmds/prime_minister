It is hardly possible to misrepresent the facts more thoroughly and more patently. The former Chancellor of the Exchequer was addressed in writing by the late Chairman, Lord Justice Cohen, who said that certain things required amplifying and clarifying, and he wrote back expressing his agreement; but no special action was taken then. On a new Chairman taking over the amendments were introduced in accordance with what had been agreed beforehand.
I see no objection to the correspondence being published, but it will be necessary to ask the other parties concerned. I have it here. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman may care to refresh his mind with it before he requires publication. I shall be very glad to have it handed to him after Question time is over.
This is all an elaborate step to fabricate another mare's nest.
