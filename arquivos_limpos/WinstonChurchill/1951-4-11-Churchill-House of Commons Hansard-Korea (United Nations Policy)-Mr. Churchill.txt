May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he is aware that there is general agreement on this side  of the House with what he calls the traditional view that the constitutional and civil authorities should control the actions of military commanders? May I also associate us on this side with what he has said about the brilliant services which General MacArthur has rendered throughout the Great War and since in the direction of affairs in Japan, and say that we do not feel that these troubles which have occurred recently in any way diminish the great quality of the services which he has rendered?
