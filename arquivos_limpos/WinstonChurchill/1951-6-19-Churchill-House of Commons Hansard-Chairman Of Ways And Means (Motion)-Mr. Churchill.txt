May I ask the Leader of the House whether he has come to any conclusion about the Motion standing on the Order Paper in my name and the names of my right hon. Friends on this bench on the question of a Ruling by the Chairman of Ways and Means?
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman—I have to adhere to the interrogative form—whether he is aware that the statement he has made will, I think, give general satisfaction, because undoubtedly it represents the proper and  correct conduct of the House in these difficult and delicate matters. I am very glad indeed—perhaps I ought to say, am I not very glad indeed—to hear that the right hon. Gentleman will have this matter cleared, in one way or the other, from the Order Paper. I cannot refer to it without saying that there is nothing personal about the Chairman of the Committee; it is a constitutional issue which is involved, and which we think ought to be cleared out of the way. The longer it remains in its present indeterminate position, the more danger there is of people in the country reading these words and using them perhaps with an undue freedom. Therefore, it seems desirable that the matter should be settled, and I am glad to have the assurance of the right hon. Gentleman.
That is absolutely right.
Yes.
I should like to thank the right hon. Gentleman for the admirable manner in which he has dealt with this issue, and I earnestly hope that any suggestion of patronage will not get him into trouble in his own family.
