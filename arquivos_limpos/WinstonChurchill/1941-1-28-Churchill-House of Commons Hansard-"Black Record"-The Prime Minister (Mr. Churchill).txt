Civil servants are required by the terms of a Treasury circular, of which I am sending a copy to my hon. Friend, to obtain the previous consent of the head of their Department to publication of a book or other work the subject matter of which is connected with their official duties or those of other public servants, and to submit to him in advance the version which is to be published.
