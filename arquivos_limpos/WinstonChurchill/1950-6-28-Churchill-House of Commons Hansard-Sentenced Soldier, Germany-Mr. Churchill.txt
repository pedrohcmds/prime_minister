Is the right hon. Gentleman sure that it would not have been possible to reduce the period of 16 days, not in respect of confirmation or otherwise of the verdict, but from the point of view of the non-execution of the  death sentence? Have the military commanders no powers similar to those which reside in the Home Secretary to mitigate a death sentence in cases where it appears obvious that it would not, in fact, be executed?
