I would like to say on behalf of the Government that we are prepared to accept this Motion. If the House sees fit to accept this Amendment, I think it will be agreed that it is desirable for the Select Committee to begin their inquiry without delay. With your consent, Mr. Speaker, and the consent of the House, I am prepared forthwith to nominate hon. Members to serve on the Committee. I am aware that notice is normally required of Motions to nominate members of Committees, but I hope that it will be possible on this occasion to waive this requirement with the consent of the House. Perhaps I should inform the House that the hon. Members whom it is proposed to appoint have been approached and express their willingness to serve on the Committee.
