I hope I am in order in seconding the Motion. At any rate I give it my wholehearted support. I agree with the Prime Minister that we cannot easily or lightly add words to those which were spoken yesterday under the promptings and spur of this loss, but it is a very great loss. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Our feelings grow. Not only is it a loss to our country but to millions of people who live in the Middle East, and it is very fitting that the Prime Minister should have moved, and be supported, as I am sure he will be, by the whole House, this Motion recording our grief and our sympathy. I have no doubt that it will carry far and wide throughout the Arab and the Israelite world and to wider regions our feelings of admiration for the great Arab statesman who has gone, and our earnest hope that his memory will be preserved, and his work not found to be in vain.
