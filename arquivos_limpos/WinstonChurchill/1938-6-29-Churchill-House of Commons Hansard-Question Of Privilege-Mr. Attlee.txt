This matter has arisen very suddenly, and is a matter, I think, of very grave concern to every Member of this House. The Prime Minister has moved that it be sent to the Committee of Privileges, but this seems to me to be a very unusual case of breach of privilege. It appears, prima facie, to be an affront to this House. This House has taken cognisance of certain incidents, and there is on the Order Paper a Motion to set up a Select Committee to deal with the matter. I understand that notice has been given that the Prime Minister himself will move that a Select Committee shall be set up to consider this matter. We now find that, under a Department of the Government, a tribunal has been set up to inquire into these very same matters, and that a Member of the House has been summoned, as an officer, to appear before it. It seems rather strange that this should be done under the authority of the Government, when the matter is to be considered by a Committee of Privileges set up by this House to protect the privileges of the House. The  very people who are the subject of inquiry in a cognate matter out of which this has arisen have taken the responsibility for setting up this tribunal, an action which seems to be in conflict with the authority of this House and its privileges. That seems to me to raise a difficult question. I do not know whether the Prime Minister will have anything to say with regard to the position of the Committee of Privileges.
Was that disclosure of secret information based on the statement made by the hon. Member for Norwood? Is that the reason for the summoning of the inquiry?
Is it not obvious that the inquiry at the War Office is inquiring into precisely the same question as this House is to inquire into, and that they are seeking to obtain through another channel the information which was attempted to be extracted by other methods from the hon. Member for Norwood?
