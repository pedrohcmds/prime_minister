Does not the hon. Gentleman realise that Dr. Weizmann and King Abdullah have both, over the vicissitudes of 20 or 30 years, shown themselves always staunch friends to this country, and will he avail himself to the full of the possibilities of bringing these two eminent men into the closest harmonious contact? Am I right in assuming that that is the general path upon which the Government are embarked and which is expressed in the statement to which we have just listened?
In view of the statement which has been made, will the hon. Gentleman and the Government reconsider the decision to give or sell 110 jet aircraft to the Egyptian Government?
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will bring it to the notice of the Prime Minister, who may possibly have heard the question? It is a very important one. Might he not discuss with the Egyptian Government the stoppage of tankers passing through the Canal, which are deeply needed to get the Haifa refinery into working order?
