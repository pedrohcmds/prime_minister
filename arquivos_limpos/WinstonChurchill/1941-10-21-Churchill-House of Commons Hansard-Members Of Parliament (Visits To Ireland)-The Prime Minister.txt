I really must state that the Home Secretary does not arrogate to himself the right. These duties have been placed upon him by the House. The House may be right or wrong, the House may change its mind, the House is all  powerful, but to say that the Home Secretary has arrogated this to himself is most unfair.
That is part of the discretionary functions which the House has laid upon the Home Secretary.
I am not complaining, because I think that the whole character of the Debate has been upon a high level and has been of value and importance. I do not think there are such very great differences between us. Certainly I must say, as I have been referred to in the Debate, that there is no part of the powers conferred on His Majesty's Government in this time of trial that I view with greater repugnance than these powers of exceptional process against the liberty of the subject without the ordinary safeguards which are inherent in British life. Those high-sounding familiar phrases like "Habeas Corpus," "petitioner's right," "charges made which are known to the law," and "trial by jury"—all these are part of what we are fighting to preserve. We all care about them and understand them, and we are determined that they shall not be in-roaded upon by anything except the need of self-preservation which arises in time of war.
I am glad that there are those differences because I think that my hon. Friend will find that his reference to using Fascist methods will be a large part of what will survive of his oration. I find that while I have been making an appeal to the House I have been drawn myself into prolonging the Debate, and I hope that will not be found any reason for not following the suggestion I have made.
