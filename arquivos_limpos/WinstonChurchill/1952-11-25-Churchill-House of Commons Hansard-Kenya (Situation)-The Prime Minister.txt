Might I suggest that it would be better for a debate to be arranged through the usual channels instead of on a precise, specific mattes  of this kind? The usual channels can be a medium for arriving at an occasion when a debate on the whole situation in Kenya can take place and—though this is hardly relevant and I ask the indulgence of the House—is it not really dangerous at this critical moment to do anything which weakens the confidence of the handful of Europeans in the discharge of their duty, upon which the prevention, perhaps, of the massacre of large numbers of white people depends?
