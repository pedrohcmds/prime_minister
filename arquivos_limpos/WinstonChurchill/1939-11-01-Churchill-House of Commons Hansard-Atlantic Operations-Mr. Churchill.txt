Two German warships of the "Deutschland" type have been reported as operating in the Atlantic, one in the North, the other in the South.
Evidence on this matter, as on other matters in this sphere, is conflicting, but I think that we may be sure that at least one vessel of "Deutschland" type has been abroad on the ocean.
Oh, yes Sir. We have people who have been held prisoner on board the "Deutschland" and we have reports from sailors of a ship captured by the "Deutschland" who were kept on the "Deutschland" for some time and who had an opportunity of making sure that it was that vessel.
I do not think that I ought to try to make any forecast of that kind.
