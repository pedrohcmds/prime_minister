I gather that the Minister of Defence wishes to make a statement, so may I ask him whether he will make one, on the work of the eighth meeting of the Consultative Council of the Brussels Treaty.
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he will not mind my saying that we do not feel much wiser for what we have heard. We will study it with great attention and endeavour to see what meaning, if any, can be extracted from it. May I ask him whether he would consider, on the first page of his statement, altering the word "merely" —" not merely a military alliance "—to "not only a military alliance," because his statement deals almost entirely with military matters. "Merely" seems, I will not say a disparaging, but an inadequate term to use. As to this new word with which he has dignified our language, but which perhaps was imposed upon him internationally, I can only say that we must have full opportunity to consider it and to consult the dictionary.
