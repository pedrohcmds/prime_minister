Could not the right hon. Gentleman at any rate make it quite clear that his Government have no intention of committing either of the two improprieties mentioned in the last part of my Question, of trying to monopolise representation of this body by members of the Socialist Party or by nominees of His Majesty's present Government?
Which I have already asked and to which the right hon. Gentleman refuses to reply. The right hon. Gentleman will, perhaps, be so kind as to tell us how long he expects this present procedure which he has described, to delay the settlement of this issue?
All the other Governments have already taken the particular decision to which I have referred and are not monopolising, through a Government majority, the entire representation upon this body. I was hoping to relieve the right hon. Gentleman and the Government, of which he is the head, of the reproach and stigma which rests upon them of being unable to give an assurance which any decent and honest-minded Government would give.
I would inform the House that we shall not be able to await this dilatory procedure without a Debate in the House. May I give the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House notice now, that tomorrow, on the Business, I shall ask him whether the week after he can provide an opportunity for a full day's Debate upon this subject? We do not mean to be kept waiting about, and, besides, we wish to relieve the Government of the shame that rests upon them.
Is it not possible to come to a decision on the simple question of decent behaviour or impropriety?
