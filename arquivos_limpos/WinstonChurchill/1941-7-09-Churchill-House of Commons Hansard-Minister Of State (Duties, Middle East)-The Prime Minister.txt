The Minister of State has authority in matters which are not concerned with the conduct of operations, but that authority is derived from his position as a member of the War Cabinet, and will no doubt be exercised in harmony with that fundamental principle.
:We set up some two months ago a new officer in the Middle East, General Sir Robert Haining, to whom I have applied the somewhat rare title of Intendant-General. His business is to serve the Commander-in-Chief with the largest possible measure of supplies in accordance with the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief and the needs of the Army, and also in accordance with the practical business of handling the great mass of supplies arriving from this country and the United States, and the Minister of State will have the benefit of the advice of Sir Robert Haining in anything which may touch this part of his duty. I would say that the kind of relations which I hope to see between the Minister of State and the Intendant-General on the one hand, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army on the other, are very largely the sort of relations  which prevail in the matter of supplies between the War Office and the Ministry of Supply in this country and General Sir Alan Brooke, commanding the Army in the United Kingdom.
Yes, Sir. Nobody in this country has plenary powers, except in accordance with the constant supervision of Parliament, exercised through the War Cabinet.
I am not certain whether it has been announced, but a charge has been made in the responsibilities for the defence of Iraq, which have been transferred to the Indian Command, and will be exercised by General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief in India.
No, Sir; he does not control any of these areas. He is in the closest touch with the Government of India, and he can communicate with them direct if he wishes, reporting at the same time to us, and I have no doubt that the closest contact will be arranged by him.
Yes, Sir, the relations will be of close contact with them and continuous courtesy and good will.
