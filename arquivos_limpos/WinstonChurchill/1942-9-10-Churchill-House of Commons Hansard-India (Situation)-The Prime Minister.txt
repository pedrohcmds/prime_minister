This, however, does not end the matter. The Indian Congress Party does not represent all India. It does not represent the majority of the people of India. It does not even represent the Hindu masses. It is a political organisation built around a party machine and sustained by certain manufacturing and financial interests. Outside  that party and fundamentally opposed to it are the 90,000,000 Moslems in British India——
—who have their rights of self-expression; the 50,000,000 Depressed Classes, or the Untouchables as they are called because they are supposed to defile their Hindu co-religionists by their presence or by their shadow; and the 95,000,000 subjects of the Princes of India with whom we are bound by treaties; in all 235,000,000 in these three large groupings alone, out of about 390,000,000 in all India. This takes no account of large elements among the Hindus, Sikhs and Christians in British India who deplore the present policy of the Congress Party. It is necessary that these main facts should not be overlooked here or abroad, because no comprehension of the Indian problem or of the relations between Britain and India is possible without the recognition of these basic data.
I have thought that the accounts in British newspapers have been very full of what has happened in India. I have endeavoured to give the House a considered statement of the facts, every one of which is established, in order to add to the information which has appeared from time to time. It is very necessary, I agree, that information of the real facts should be made public, not only here, but also in the United States.
When we come to the Adjournment any hon. Member can raise any topic, if he catches the Speaker's eye, and should anyone raise the question of India, we will see that the Minister responsible is here in order to deal with any point which may arise.
It is my business to speak in the name of the War Cabinet, and I have every reason to believe that I am doing so. I do not mean by that that I submit every word of a statement and go through it line by line, but the general policy is the policy of His Majesty's Government.
Of course, it is very unusual to seek to inquire what are the details of the discussions which prevail in any Government, but I have every reason to believe that my colleagues approve of the statement I have made, as I think does the House in general.
The hon. Gentleman is a merchant of discourtesy. I was about to answer his question, and I can do so by saying that up to a very late hour last night my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I were at work on the actual words of this statement.
I have made it perfectly clear in my statement that those proposals, which were solemnly undertaken, in their broad principles stand.
I have no information which would lead to that idea, and, of course, in the present state of affairs in India, with invasion not far off, these constitutional solutions and agreements are very difficult to come to.
There was a feeling in a great many quarters that the Debate on the Adjournment might prove the occasion for some reference to Indian affairs, and, no doubt, opinions will be expressed on both sides on this matter as the Chair may call Members. I entirely agree that we must look forward to an opportunity in the future, in the not distant future, for debating the general issue that is open now in India. Personally, I think that when we come back such an opportunity might well be found, though one must see what is the exact situation in that country as to whether it would be a good moment for a very extended Debate. But the Government have a perfectly plain and clear policy upon which they are united, and we are quite ready to stand any Debate or discussion which the House may wish to raise, having regard to the general interest.
The reinforcements have been sent to protect the great masses of the Indian people from Japanese invasion. The fact that they are in the country undoubtedly does add to the general stability which happily prevails in India. What was the other point raised by the hon. Gentleman?
It is not within my power to improvise Parliamentary procedure.
On the contrary, I may have learned something about it from 40 years' experience, but I would not attempt to improvise. As a matter of fact, a vote can take place only on a Resolution, and Resolutions require proper notice and so forth, but it may well be that there will be a vote when we have a full-dress Debate on India at a later period.
On the policy of His Majesty's Government.
