Mr. Speaker, I am sure that everyone in this House will have learned with regret of the death of Mr. Hubert Beaumont. I do not think that we realised, when illness forced him to give up the position he was holding in this House, that that illness would so soon terminate fatally. I think that during his tenure of the Deputy-Chairmanship he had commanded the respect of the whole House. He was courteous, he understood the duties of the Chair, he was impartial, he served the House faithfully. I am sure that we are all very sorry that he had no time to rest after those arduous duties, and the sympathy of all of us will go out to his wife and son.
