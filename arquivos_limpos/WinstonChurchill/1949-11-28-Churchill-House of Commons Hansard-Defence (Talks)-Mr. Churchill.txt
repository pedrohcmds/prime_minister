I presume that I may take the last sentence of the right hon. Gentleman's answer as making it clear that the Opposition in no way accept any responsibility for the state of national defence by the fact of these conversations. At any rate, it seems most necessary to emphasise that. We have not thought it right to have a Debate for some time upon national defence, and I find great difficulty in coming to any conclusions upon that without knowing for how long this Parliament is going on. It certainly would not be worth while addressing the present House on the subject unless its sittings are to be prolonged into the late summer. The right hon. Gentleman must not take it, and it must not be taken by the public outside, that the fact—[HON. MEMBERS: "Speech."] I am asking the right hon. Gentleman a question.
Am I right in assuming, Sir, that the right hon. Gentleman will not take it that this absence of Debate and anything that he has said in his statement, in the slightest degree commits us to approval of or agreement with the Government?
