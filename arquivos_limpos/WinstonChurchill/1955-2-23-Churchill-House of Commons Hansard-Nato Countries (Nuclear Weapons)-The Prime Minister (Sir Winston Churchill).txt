A country such as ours with world-wide commitments could not accept control by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation over non-N.A.T.O. activities. We could not therefore propose that other countries should submit to such restrictions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation can therefore only impose restrictions on the actions of member Governments when they are acting as members of that Organisation. I may add that it is public knowledge that American Air forces based in Britain will only be used with the consent of Her Majesty's Government.
