(by Private Notice) asked the Lord President of the Council whether he is aware that, following on his statement of 4th December, Questions from Members relating to the various industries that have been nationalised during the present Parliament are not accepted at the Table, and whether, as this situation affects the rights of Parliament in respect  of large spheres of public business of widespread concern to the nation, he will allow an early opportunity for a full discussion of the far reaching issues involved.
The right hon. Gentleman will, I trust, agree with me in the general principle, that Members should have the freest possible right to put Questions on the Paper without prejudice to the undoubted right of Ministers to refuse to answer them if they consider the public interest is involved and if they are supported by the general feeling of the House? That is the only principle that I am wishing to assert. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, at the present time, whole blocks of very important topics, in which enormous numbers of people are interested and concerned, are ruled out because it is thought that Ministers do not wish to have those Questions answered, and because it is alleged that Ministers have no particular power over the nationalised industries in question, whereas, in the case of a good many of the industries that have been nationalised, specific powers have been retained by the Government both in regard to the securing of information from the industries and in regard to control over them? Will he bear this in mind, that there is no question at all of denying the ultimate right of a Minister to refuse to answer Questions provided he can carry with him the support of the House of Commons, but that there is grave objection to whole  classes of Questions being excluded even from being placed upon the Order Paper as a result of some Ministerial utterance? On the question of the Debate upon this subject, we gladly receive the right hon. Gentleman's assurance that conversations may take place with a view to fixing a date; but I must submit to him that this matter is not a party matter, that the Questions come from all parts of the House, that it concerns the Procedure of the House of Commons, and that, therefore, we consider most strongly that it rests with the Leader of the House to offer reasonable opportunity for this discussion in the Government's time.
With very great respect, I am a little taken aback by the extent of the Ruling which you have given on this matter, Mr. Speaker. For a great many years, Sir, I submit to you, there has grown up the custom that the Table—and we have the greatest respect for the manner in which the Clerks at the Table discharge their duties—have only refused, say, questions of a particular class affecting individuals, and reflecting sometimes upon them. This has grown up by custom of the House. But now, suddenly, a vast mass of topics—whole series of topics on vitally important business affecting millions of people—has come under this bar.
Why does the right hon. Gentleman suppose that in the war the  Minister of Information "got away with it "—to use his own colloquial expression?
Was that not because he was supported by the majority of the House of Commons? Is that not the right foundation on which Ministers can rely for the endorsement of their discretionary powers as to whether or not they should answer a Question? If Parliament, by a majority, supports them, and if it is the general feeling, no one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and feelings—[Interruption.] Just listen. No one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and the majority of the House in these matters. But with regard to putting a Question on the Paper, surely the presumption should be that any Question may be put on the Paper unless barred by those long customs of good taste and non-assailment of individuals, which have been accepted by the House for generations. The presumption is that anybody may put a Question on the Paper. Does the right hon. Gentleman not realise that we are not objecting at all to the power of the Government, supported by the House of Commons, to refuse to answer Questions? What we are criticising is the institution of an arbitrary and mechanical bar to the placing of those Questions on the Paper.
Oh, yes.
