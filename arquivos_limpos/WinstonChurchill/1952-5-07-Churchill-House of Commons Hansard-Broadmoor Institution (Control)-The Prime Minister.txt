I have no doubt that all relevant matters comprised within the scope of their reference, which has not yet been announced, will be taken into consideration by the Committee. But that does not in any way preclude the general consideration of the whole position by Her Majesty's Government.
I think that is a decision which is obviously one for the Government.
I have not the terms of reference in my mind at present; I might, therefore, mislead the hon. Gentleman if I tried to guess.
I cannot pretend to be conversant with all these details, but the whole matter is to be examined by an inquiry.
