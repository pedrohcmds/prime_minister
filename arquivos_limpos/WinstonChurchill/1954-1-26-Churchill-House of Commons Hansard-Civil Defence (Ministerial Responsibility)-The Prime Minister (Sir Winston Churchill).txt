No, Sir. Experience before, during and since the last war has shown conclusively that the main Civil Defence work is so closely linked with the maintenance of law and order and the work of local authorities that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland must be the focal points for preparations and for operational control in the event of war. There has, of course, to be close liaison between the fighting Services and  those engaged in Civil Defence, but this can be effectively secured, in our opinion, by consultations between Ministers and the services concerned.
