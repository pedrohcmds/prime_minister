I think I have given a rather important answer on this matter, and I certainly do not think we should be pressed at this moment upon a detail like the actual time that should be allowed.
In the main, we are only proceeding on the same lines as were adopted by the late Government. A somewhat new version of the dispute has come up, but, nevertheless, the legal powers at the disposal of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Education, and the duties devolving upon her are unchanged.
This is supposed to be a reasonable country, and if people want to come on deputations, and so on, to parley with Ministers and to discuss matters, that is not a matter which should be turned down at all. But, on the other hand, there are certain principles which have to be upheld.
There are various powers possessed in different degrees by the Ministries who may be concerned, but the Minister of Education has most clear and definite powers, and uses them.
I think that is a matter which ought to be considered by all parties.
It happens that the sick pay is the only matter on which, in view of the previous agreement, it was open to the Durham County Council to act, but they are raising exactly the same issues on the only point left open to them after, as I understand it, the agreement made with the late Government.
