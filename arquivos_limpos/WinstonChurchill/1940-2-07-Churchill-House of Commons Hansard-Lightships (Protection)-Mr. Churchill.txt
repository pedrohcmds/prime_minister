Lightships have never heretofore been specially protected because they have always been regarded by civilized nations as outside the scope of hostilities and immune from attack. Consequently the lighthouse service has never assisted us in reporting enemy activity. I think that should be noted. In view of several recent savage anarchic attacks by German aircraft upon lightships round our coast and the murder of some of their crews, special measures will be taken to provide protection for this service; and where possible, light floats will replace lightships in outer positions.
