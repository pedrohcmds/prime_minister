I think there is a general feeling in all parts of the House about the serious character of these events and also of the difficulty of measuring beforehand the consequences which it may have. In these circumstances, I would ask the indulgence of the House not to press me to try to say anything until we have further and fuller information.
I was both shocked and grieved to read this report. I think that is felt in every part of the House. I still think that there may be a hope that the truce which is so nearly arranged will not be prevented.
That is a hypothetical question. Naturally, if there is any necessity to make a statement, I will have one made.
Before you give your ruling, Mr. Speaker, I most respectfully submit that it is not a matter of Ministerial responsibilty here. We have absolutely no control over the immediate course of events.
