Anybody who has read carefully the Memorandum which accompanies the Estimates must, I think, pay tribute to the energy and ability of the Secretary of State and his staff for all that they have done in carrying out that programme. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman opposite would like us to imitate Germany in the methods which she has employed in regimenting the country for the production of armaments.
The hon. Member says we may have to, but at any rate, we are not going to do so until we are convinced that nothing else will serve our turn. While, as I said, at any time I should find it very difficult to accede to this request, which in fact amounts to instituting a court-martial upon the Air Ministry, I put it to hon. Members that they could not find a more inopportune moment than the present to institute an investigation which must distract the attention and occupy the minds of those who are engaged, not only in administration, but also in the production of our programmes. This is not the time to harry them to answer questions which do not sound to me as though they were based on any very competent authority. Let us all put our efforts together, get on with the job, and supply this country with the Air Force which it requires in the shortest possible time.
Surely, the hon. Baronet must have read the passage of the report in which the Committee point out that we cannot entirely separate the military from the civil side.
May I reply to what the hon. Member has just said? The passage which he has quoted deals with civil aviation and civil aviation alone, and the censure of which he speaks, of neglect of responsibility, is in relation to civil aviation. That is specifically mentioned.
I know. That is the sentence which the hon. Member has quoted already, but that is not the passage which the hon. Member for Berwick-on-Tweed (Sir H. Seely) quoted. He quoted a passage from paragraph 23, whereas what the hon. Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague) has quoted is paragraph 26. I am speaking of paragraph 23. I say that the censure upon the Secretary of State had reference to civil aviation and that the answer to that censure is that it is true that this matter was neglected, but the reason is clear and obvious to everybody, namely, that the Secretary of State was obliged to give his whole attention to the question of military aviation until that, at any rate, had been put on its feet.
I must not be interpreted as saying that the Secretary of State was to blame. What I said was that civil aviation had necessarily been neglected while our whole resources were being devoted to military aviation.
