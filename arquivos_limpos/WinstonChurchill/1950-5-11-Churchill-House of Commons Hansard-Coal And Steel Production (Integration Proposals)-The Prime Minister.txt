I think that probably it will be realised that it is a little early for me to give a definite reply at the moment. I should like to look into that very carefully. The matter should be discussed through the usual channels  to see just how things are going and how this matter can be arranged most conveniently for the House, and in the public interest.
I do not want to tie myself down to a specific date at the moment. On the general principle, I agree that this is an important matter which should be discussed. I am quite sure that it would be best to discuss the matter through the usual channels.
So I understand.
I will consider that. I understand that the full text has been published, but I will consider whether it is useful to lay a White Paper.
Yes, certainly, but this is a question of considering whether a statement which has, I understand, been put out very fully in the public Press, is necessarily to be circulated as a White Paper before it has been considered whether or not any comments, and the rest, should be put out with it. Sometimes, it may be a waste of time. I will certainly consider in what way we can assist the House best in this matter.
I agree.
