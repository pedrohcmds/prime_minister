I do not propose to deal with the various criticisms which have been made by the hon. Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague), but the hon. Member concluded his speech by repeating the request for an independent inquiry into the work of the military side of the Royal Air Force, and it is for the purpose of dealing with that point, and that alone, that I have risen. The hon. Member based his request on what he represented to be virtually the demand of the Cadman Committee. I must say that I find nothing in the report of the Cadman Committee which justifies any statement such as that. One casual observation in a single paragraph out of the 124 paragraphs in the report was taken by the hon. Member, and he put on it a weight which was evidently far greater than it was in itself intended to bear. If, indeed, it had been in the mind of the Committee that an inquiry of this kind, or of the kind described by the hon. Member, were necessary in the public interest, they would certainly not have dismissed it in that brief sentence, but would have supported that demand by an adequate buttressing of evidence.
