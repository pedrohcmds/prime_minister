May I answer the first one now?
Every effort is made to what I might call dovetail these arrangements and to utilise labour not immediately needed for defence purposes for the export trade, but there are some gaps which cannot be immediately filled.
In regard to the second of the three questions which the right hon. Gentleman has put to me, it is a fact that, if the three-year re-armament programme drawn up by the late Government had been carried through in full, considerably heavier Estimates would have to be met by Parliament than those which we shall now present. One of the important causes of that is, of course, the rise in prices, but it is not the only cause. The cause is that, as production gets on the move, there is an acceleration and expansion, and very often things are achieved on a somewhat larger scale at an earlier moment than perhaps was estimated for; but, broadly speaking, if we had gone on with that programme which we found on arriving in office, there would have been considerably heavier expenses to meet, and it might have affected the balance of payments adversely.
I am not sure of that. I do not think there can be any debate on this before Christmas, but when the White Paper is produced we come into the whole process of examination of Estimates, and not only of Estimates of the Defence Vote, which carries with it the general discussion of the whole field of public defence.
No, I could not do so in detail without notice; I would not be able to remember at this moment. But sometimes it is better to slow down the production of weapons which are being superseded by newer and better types in order to be more ahead a little later on. The fact that we have felt able to do that indicates, on the whole, that we do not think that the worst emergencies with which we might be faced have approached any nearer to us.
These are difficult questions to answer on the spur of the moment. The original £4,700 million programme carried with it three years of maintenance. Now it is spread over four years, and we have advanced in time, so  it is spread over four, and, in part over five years in which there are new maintenance charges running each year, and, in addition, there is the rise in prices.
I think I said some time ago that it would be £5,300 million at the value then prevailing, but it is more than that now, and if we take a fourth year it may be well over £6,000 million. I do not think we can be reproached with not taking a serious view of the financial aspect.
No, Sir. As I have said, we always guard ourselves upon the point of solvency and capacity to produce, because these estimates were originally produced to meet a great emergency. It had to be done very quickly indeed, but now it comes home in much more detail. As far as manpower is concerned, I can undertake that we shall not call up a single man who is not absolutely necessary for the discharge of our obligations, but I think that at this critical juncture above all others, for Great Britain, if we, instead of setting an example as far as we can in terms of service to the Continental Powers, were to make a violent reduction in our manpower or in our terms of service, the result could not be estimated merely by any reduction in our own strength. It might bring about an almost complete collapse of the great organisation which grew up under the previous Administration and for which its  leading Members have the responsibility and the credit.
Oddly enough, and without further investigation, I should imagine it would be the Admiralty itself. It always used to be. All these matters will require and deserve the searching attention of the House next year when the Estimates are presented for each of the Service Departments. Also, I can say now that, once the White Paper has been laid, be shall be anxious to afford the fullest facility for a debate on the subject which, however one looks at it, ought to be a non-party affair.
Certainly. They are actually engaged in combat in both those theatres, and obviously they have the first claim on the supply of munitions of war.
