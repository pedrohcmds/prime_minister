No, Sir. No official reply has been received to the message in the name of the President and myself, unless the disappearance of Mussolini is to be construed as his own reply to it. As regards the second part of the Question, His Majesty's Government have not made any apology for bombing the marshalling yards near Rome. On the contrary, if they are repaired and hostile military traffic is resumed, they will no doubt have to be bombed again.
