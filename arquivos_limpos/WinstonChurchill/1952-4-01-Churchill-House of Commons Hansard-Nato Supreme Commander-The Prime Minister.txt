I really do not think it would be advisable from any point of view for us to express very strong opinions upon this matter.
We have had controversies on this point on another subject. It seemed to me quite natural that the British should have the command of the Atlantic, and I am bound to say that when we think of the great American Army and all that they are doing to support the front in Europe, if they have the slightest wish to have the command we should certainly support them.
If I remember rightly, the decision about the Admiral of the Atlantic was announced without the House being told about it beforehand. The right hon. Gentleman must be very careful not, by a refinement of unreason to manage to be wrong both times.
