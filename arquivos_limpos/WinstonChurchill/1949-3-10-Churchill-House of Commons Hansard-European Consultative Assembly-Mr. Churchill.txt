May I ask the Prime Minister a Question of which I have given him private notice, namely, whether his attention has been drawn to the Motion referring to the European Consultative Assembly which is on the Paper? It is supported by a large number of Members, almost 100, belonging to all parties in the House. Will he now make a statement on this matter?
Can the right hon. Gentleman give any indication or idea of how long this will take?
But what does "long delayed now" mean? A month or two months, or what will it be?
I hope the right hon. Gentleman realises that I am anxious to rescue him from the very uncomfortable and invidious position in which he lies in the meanwhile when he appears to be denying that each representative of Great Britain shall be free to speak and vote as he or she thinks fit at any meeting of the Consultative Assembly; and, secondly, that the British representatives at the first Consultative Assembly should reflect the relative strength of the political forces in the House of Commons and should be appointed from Members of both Houses by a Resolution of this House. The point I am going to put is whether the right hon. Gentleman can afford indefinitely to go on denying, or appearing to deny, recognition to these obvious democratic truths and principles?
