Will my right hon. Friend say how often it meets?
We are debating a Motion for an inquiry into the state and condition of air defence, and I must say that the various postponements, and the changes which have taken place, have introduced new features into the argument. The inquiry was demanded for two purposes—first, to fix responsibility for the failures of the past; and secondly, to stimulate more vigorous action in the future. The second of these purposes must be assumed, to some extent at any rate, to be fulfilled by the appointment of a new Minister. Everyone wishes my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air success. He brings, as the Prime Minister said, high administrative experience, abilities that we all know, and House of Commons experience—he brings it all to his difficult task. We are all sure that he will try his best, and that he will not spare himself in any way. The very fact of appointing a new Minister means that the whole structure and work of the Department will be  surveyed and scrutinised from a new point of view, and the public and Parliamentary criticism, which is rife at this moment, must necessarily be extremely effective at the time when this new survey is being made.
The date is 7th March.
With great respect, the Prime Minister must not use arguments that are not relevant to the issue. The Government have promised air parity with Germany. What relation has that got to the Anschluss? The question of our air strength is not influenced from day to day and hour to hour by the accidents and changes that take place in Europe. Let me read to the House—for I think we have some grievance in this matter—a statement made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Coordination of Defence: 
I think that makes it worse. It is one of those statements which, apart from the purport, you can just claim to be literally true, but when it is presented to Parliament it has just the effect complained of in the statement of the Secretary of State for War yesterday, of having a thoroughly soothing, reassuring effect on the general public, while, at the same time, it in no way represents the actuality of the position. Everybody listening to that would have thought that the trouble was over, and that the great flow of new machines was coming forward 22 months ago. Yet it is not until 31st March, 1939, that we are to have even 1,750 first-line aeroplanes. I have dealt with the interruption made by my right hon. Friend.
By committees of the Council.
