Are we right in understanding that these are in fact arrangements for the repayment to these countries of British debts which were incurred by us in the process of defending them from invasion by Japan?
Surely some consideration should also be given to the fact that these debts were incurred for the defence of these countries, and that our right was always reserved until quite recently to make a counterclaim for the immense expense to which we were put? Surely these matters should be considered with a view to thinking sometimes of the interests of our own country?
Is it not a fact that we have always reserved the right to put in a counterclaim for the expenses or a portion of the expenses to which we were put, and that these counterclaims need to be considered not only against these countries but also against Egypt at a time when these settlements are being made?
Is it not a fact that until quite recently that has always been maintained as the British position?
Was not the Prime Minister a Member of the Government which definitely laid down the principle of reserving the right to make a counterclaim?
Will the right hon. Gentleman recognise that this is by no means an agreed matter between the different parties in the House?
May I say that I should have hesitated a long time before making such a filthy charge?
