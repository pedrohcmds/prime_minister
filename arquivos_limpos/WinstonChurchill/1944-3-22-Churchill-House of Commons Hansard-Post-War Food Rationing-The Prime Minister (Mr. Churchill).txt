The full text of the speech of my right hon. and gallant Friend the Minister of Food shows clearly that he is no advocate of rationing for rationing's sake and in particular that he is a firm believer in the fact that we are down, in this country, to the minimum ration diet which will enable it to realise its full war effort in the field and in the factory. It is obvious that rationing will have to continue for some time after the end of the war. I do not, therefore, consider that my right hon. and gallant Friend's speech raised any new issue. I am sending a copy of it to my hon. and gallant Friend.
