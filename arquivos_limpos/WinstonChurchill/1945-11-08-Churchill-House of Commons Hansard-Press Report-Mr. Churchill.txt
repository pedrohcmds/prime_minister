(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the public anxiety aroused, he is now in a position to state the decision reached by His Majesty's Government as to the future of the hospitals, both voluntary and municipal?
:Will the Prime Minister take into consideration that considerable harm has been done by this statement, this unauthorised statement, from many points of view, and that the springs of private charity may be dried up before the tides of public benevolence begin to flow? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that literally from day to day people are giving large sums to the voluntary hospitals or are leaving them, under bequests, and that great disturbance has been caused by this unauthorised publication? Has he made or taken any steps to ascertain how this leakage occurred and what is the foundation of it?
Is the Prime Minister aware that the "Daily Herald," the official organ of the Socialist Party, published a statement beginning, "The Cabinet have decided," and so on? Can he not use his influence, which I trust is greater under present conditions than it was in the late Administration, with that organ? In any case, will he not say something to give stability to the position until he is prepared with the proposals for changes?
:Whilst they are keeping up their courage, may I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether we may now take it that these are idle and unauthorised rumours, that when the Government have a plan they will announce it and that they will try to keep their own secrets till the proper moment comes?
In the "Daily Herald."
