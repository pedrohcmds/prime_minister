I should warmly welcome a meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers should this be found possible, and I am, of course, in constant correspondence with them. The House will, I am sure, realise that each Dominion is differently circumstanced in this matter, and that it may not be easy to arrange for all the Dominion Prime Ministers to visit this country at the same time.
