The whole question of the capacity required for merchant shipbuilding is under investigation. The first task will be, of course, to see that the fullest possible use is made of all yards which are immediately available to undertake new construction. I am afraid that I can, at present, hold out no hope of the re-opening of yards which are now totally dismantled.
Certainly we are opening up every facility for building merchant ships of which our labour and materials enable us to take advantage.
Circumstances alter cases.
Everything will be done to produce the greatest possible volume.
