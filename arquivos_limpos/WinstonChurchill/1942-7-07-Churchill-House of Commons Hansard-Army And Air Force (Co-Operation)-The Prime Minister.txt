I have carefully considered this matter and taken a great deal of different opinions on the subject, and the result, as I believe, has been satisfactory.
The joint training of the Army and the Royal Air Force is already proceeding on a considerable  scale and is being continually extended. The aircraft of Army co-operation command, which is itself being substantially expanded, are occupied solely on such training. Squadrons of Bomber and Fighter Command are also regularly used for this purpose.
Of course, this subject is capable of extensive discussion, but we have to try and find the true and proper course between, on the one hand, not having aircraft attached to the infantry, which would be a misfortune, and, on the other, keeping large masses of aircraft which are required for major purposes standing by on specialised functions.
I would not say it is quite satisfactory, but it is being pressed forward with the utmost energy, in complete accord with both the Services concerned and the technical branches which are at their disposal.
The whole question of air-borne troops, whether it concerns the gliders which may be attached to machines with power, whether it concerns parachute troops themselves, or whether it concerns the aircraft which are power driven and tow the gliders—all these are under one organisation and are being studied as a whole.
If my hon. Friend read my statement at leisure, he will see that I go further than that. The entire  Air Force is subordinated to the purposes of the military commander; he says what he wants them to do, but naturally you must not interfere with the characteristics of a particular arm. How the purposes are carried out is a matter for the Air Officer Commanding.
I should be glad to consider it, but I should not like to answer the question without having had the benefit of that process beforehand.
