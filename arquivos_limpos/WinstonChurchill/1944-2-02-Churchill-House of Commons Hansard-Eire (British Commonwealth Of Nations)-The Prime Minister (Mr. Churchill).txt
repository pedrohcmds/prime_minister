My hon. Friend will note that the speech to which his Question refers was made, not by a member of the Government of Southern Ireland, but by one of the Opposition leaders. I am not aware of any alteration in the standpoint of the Southern Irish Government. So long as the attitude of that Government remains what it is as regards the war, our relations  tions with them in all matters must take account of that dominating fact.
