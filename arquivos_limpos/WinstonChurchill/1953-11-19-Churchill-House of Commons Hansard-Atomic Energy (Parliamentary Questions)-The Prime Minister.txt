I have said that, after 1st January, the Minister of Works will answer Questions here on this subject on behalf of the Lord President of the Council. [An HON. MEMBER: "Not good enough."] You do not like that; you do not like the House of Lords at all. That will be the arrangement which will be made, but, with regard to the making of atomic weapons by the Ministry of Supply, Questions on that subject will, as hitherto, be answered by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply.
No, Sir. We have considered that a line should properly be drawn in this case, though not in every case, between research and supply.
I think that the arrangement which has been made is the most convenient.
