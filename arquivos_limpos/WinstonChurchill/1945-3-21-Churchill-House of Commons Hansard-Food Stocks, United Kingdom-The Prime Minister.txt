The hon. Gentleman is quite right. The American Government have been continually informed. The statement I was quoting did not emanate from the American Government, but I think it is a mistake to get widespread misunderstanding in these matters, which are going to be settled in the most friendly and considerate manner by both sides.
No. I should deprecate the Debate being carried on on the basis of invidious comparisons. I believe that the usual processes of patience, good will and interchange of fair argument will have the effect of enabling us to reach a full agreement about what is best to do in the common cause.
I hope myself that we shall remember the old saying that "comparisons are odious."

That is quite true, and large portions of Europe may be faced with varying degrees of famine—in some cases, total famine—in this forthcoming winter. That is a reason for accelerating the military operations to the utmost of our intensity.

I really think that that may be left to the intelligent organs of public guidance and opinion which are such a feature of our national life.
