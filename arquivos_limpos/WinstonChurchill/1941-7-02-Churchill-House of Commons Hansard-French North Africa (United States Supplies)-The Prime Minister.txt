Yes, Sir. I think it would be a difficult question to thrash out in public, from various points of view. I think that there is a good deal to be said on both sides of the argument. On the whole I have become convinced that it is an advantage to the United States to have contacts which in our case no longer exist.
A question of this kind begins over the matter of shipping or of economic warfare.
I cannot possibly answer that question. Is the hon. Member discontented?
Then, in that case, he should take the opportunity of raising this matter in Debate.
The whole tendency of this Question pays too little attention to the gravity of the situation.
Perhaps if the Debate took a certain turn I should have to draw the attention of Mr. Speaker to the fact that there were Strangers present.
The whole matter has been most carefully discussed and is a matter of high policy. I am of the opinion that the views of the United  States should be treated with the greatest respect. I am certain of this, that any action which may at this time be taken by the United States is conceived only with a sincere desire to aid the war effort of this country.
