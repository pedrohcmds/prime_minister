I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not leave us in any doubt about this point as to the Dominions. He has assured us they were consulted, and no doubt there were discussions, but is it the fact that they were consulted before the decision was taken, or was the decision taken and they were just told of the decision?

The troops were to go as soon as the barracks were made along the Canal.
It was an Egyptian obligation.
The war came within two years. The Treaty was signed in 1936, the barracks were to take several years to build, and, very quickly, came Munich, and, the next year, the war came. It was not a case of blaming the British for bad faith.
I have no knowledge of what the hon. Gentleman says.
Yes, I see. Then the negotiations are for the purpose of securing a satisfactory defence of the Canal zone in a manner most agreeable to Egyptian sentiment. If they break down, then we revert to the 1936 Treaty. That is a very important admission, and I am bound to say it relieves my anxiety to some extent, but it in no way improves the view which we take of the method by which the Government intend to handle this matter. They begin by saying, "We will withdraw the troops." They go on to say, "If the Canal zone is not properly defended, we revert to the 1936 Treaty with the troops on the Canal zone." But who has ever suggested that there is any method of safeguarding the Canal except by troops in the Canal zone? You will not get any military man of eminence and responsibility to say that the Canal can be kept open—because that is the whole point; it is to keep the Canal open. Anyone can close the Canal from hundreds of miles away; it is to keep it open that we require  troops on the spot, not only when danger has come but in the months before the storm has burst.
If the right hon. Gentleman cares to read the speech, he will see that I prescribed a minimum of 1,000,000 men with the Army for the service of the year, and the Government cut down that number to 600,000.
