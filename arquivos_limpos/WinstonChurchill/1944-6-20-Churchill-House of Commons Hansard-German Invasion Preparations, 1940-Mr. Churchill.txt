Well, Sir, it is a matter on which I should not like to take people off other current jobs in order to use their time to-day. I do not know what my hon. and gallant Friend means by "set in motion." "Set in motion," in the sense of crossing the Channel, no; "set in motion," in the sense of making very heavy concentrations, both of troops and ships, to cross the Channel, yes.
Yes, Sir.
Not to my belief. A great deal of it was smashed in the ports, and then they changed their minds.
