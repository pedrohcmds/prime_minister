Yes, Sir. Reports were received yesterday indicating that forces from North Korea had crossed the 38th Parallel at a number of points, in the course of the invasion of the Korean Republic. At the request of the Government of the United States of America an emergency meeting of the Security Council was held, at which a resolution was passed to the effect that the action of the forces of North Korea constituted a breach of the peace. The resolution called for the immediate cessation of hostilities, and called upon the authorities of North Korea to withdraw forthwith their armed forces to the 38th Parallel. The resolution further called upon all  members to render every assistance to the United Nations in the execution of this resolution and to refrain from giving assistance to the North Korean authorities. The delegate of the Soviet Union did not attend.
Certainly, Sir.
This is a matter which is before the Security Council. It is not a matter of opening discussions with the Russians. The situation has arisen between North Korea and South Korea.
No, Sir. We only have a Consul, I think, in Seoul. We are keeping in contact.
Yes, that is what I said.
