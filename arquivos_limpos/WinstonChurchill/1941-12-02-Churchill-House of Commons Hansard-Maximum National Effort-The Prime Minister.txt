I shall come to that presently. Those not granted deferment will of course retain their individual rights under the National Service Act concerning conscientious objection, postponement of calling-up on account of exceptional hardship, and other mitigations. They will have the full protection and rights which are enjoyed by those called up by the National Service Act.
If the House releases the Government from its undertaking, that would follow, but it is entirely in the hands of the House.
No. I have not said so. I said they would be encouraged.
I am coming to the point which the Noble Lady has uppermost in her mind—the subject of women. In order to put as many minds at rest as possible, let me begin by saying two things. First, we do not propose at the present time to extend compulsion to join the Services to any married women, not even childless married women. They may of course volunteer, but they will not be compelled. Secondly, as regards married women and industry, we have already the power, and my right hon. Friend has already been given the power and has been frequently reminded of it, to direct married women into industry. This power will continue to be used with discretion. The wife of a man serving in  the Forces or Merchant Navy will not be called upon to work away from her home area; nor will women with household responsibilities be moved from their home area. But there are some married women without children or other household responsibilities whom we may have to call upon to go to another area where their industrial services are needed.
