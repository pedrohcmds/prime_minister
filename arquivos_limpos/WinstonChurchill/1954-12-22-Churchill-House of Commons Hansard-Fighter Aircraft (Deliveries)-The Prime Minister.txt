No, Sir. I am not proposing to hold any special inquiry, but a continuous examination of the whole subject is proceeding.
All these matters will have to be considered if any changes such as those at which I hinted were actually brought into force.
Yes, Sir. I shall. I hope we shall have plenty of time to do so in the weeks approaching us which are usually the occasion when heavy work can be best accomplished.
I am always glad to look to any part of HANSARD which enables me to say, "I told you so."
As I informed the House in reply to a supplementary question on 16th December, I consider that this is a matter which should be presented to the House during the debates on the Estimates.
Yes, Sir, I think that when the general question of business is gone into when we meet together again we must see what is most convenient.
