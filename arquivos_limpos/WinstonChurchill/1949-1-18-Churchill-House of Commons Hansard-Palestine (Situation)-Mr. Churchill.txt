I fear that we shall have to ask for a Debate next week and no doubt it would be very satisfactory if that were prefaced by a further statement by the right hon. Gentleman. I venture to put to you, Sir, that the House must not be prevented from discussing matters of real and burning interest by vague statements of great improvements that are on the way and important delicate discussions which are going on. Nor do I think this last statement which has been made by the right hon. Gentleman—the announcement which he has just made of the release of large, or considerable numbers, of Jewish immigrants of fighting age from Cyprus in order that they should  join the Jewish Forces in Palestine—fits in very well with the drastic military action which he has taken in other directions. Is he not in fact reinforcing both sides at once?
