The noble Lord is losing his memory. He was a contemporary of mine at Oxford in those days. Whether or not he behaved as a schoolboy is another matter. In fact, if I am not wrong, he was returned to this House in 1904, and this event occurred in 1905. In any event, I am quite right about the right hon. Member for Woodford because he, having recently left the Conservative Party and joined the Liberal Party, took a very prominent part in rubbing it in on his late leader, Mr. Balfour.
