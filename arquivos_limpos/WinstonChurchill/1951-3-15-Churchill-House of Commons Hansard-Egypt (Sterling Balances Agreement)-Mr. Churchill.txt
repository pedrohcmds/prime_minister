Can the Financial Secretary tell us, in a phrase, how much is the actual total we have to pay to Egypt for having protected her against the Nazi and Facist invasion, and whether this compensation in respect of petroleum is to be settled irrespective of the illegal blockade maintained by the Egyptian Government over oil cargoes going through the Suez Canal?
How does the Financial Secretary contend that this is Egyptian money? It is money which they claim on sterling balances and takes the form of unrequited exports from this country.

I could not see that my hon. and gallant Friend behind me was seeking to put a question. May I ask whether these sterling balances were not always, in accordance with the policy of the National Coalition Government, to be subject to off-sets made against them by claims for having defended the freedom and safety of that country during the period of the war?
You gave in.
