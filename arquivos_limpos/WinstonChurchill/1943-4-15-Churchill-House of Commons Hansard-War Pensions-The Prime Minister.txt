My right hon. Friend will no doubt be desirous of making sure that the Committee is properly representative, but it is not the intention of the Government to transfer any executive power in this matter from the Government.
During the whole of my service in this House I have never  known any occasion when a Debate on pensions has not given universal dissatisfaction.
That Question should be put on the Order Paper.
I think Parliament is possessed of all the necessary powers for controlling and influencing the Executive.
