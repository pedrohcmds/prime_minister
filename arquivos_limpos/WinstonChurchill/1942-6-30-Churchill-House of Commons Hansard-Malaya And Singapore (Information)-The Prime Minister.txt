I certainly never contemplated being committed to the publication of these documents, which were collected for the instruction and further information of the military authorities, and whether they should be made public  or not could only be decided after they had been seen. It clearly would cause a great deal of ill-will throughout the British Empire.
I have addressed myself to the Question on the Paper, and to some extent that answers the Supplementary Question of the hon. Gentleman, for I have no statement to make based on these documents at the present time.
