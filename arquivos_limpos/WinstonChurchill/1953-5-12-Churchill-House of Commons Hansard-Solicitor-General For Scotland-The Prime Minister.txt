I am proceeding upon very solid precedents, and I may perhaps be permitted to give to the House some of the precedents on which I have relied in this matter. In 1924, from February to November, Mr. Fenton; in 1929, May to June, Mr. Normand; 1929–31, Mr. Watson; 1936–37, Mr. Reid; 1941-43, Sir David Murray; 1945–47, Mr. D. P. Blades; 1947—this is where you come in—March to October, Mr. Wheatley; 1947–48, Mr. D. H. Johnston. All these are precedents for a Solicitor-General—[Hon. Members: "Who is he now?"]—not sitting in the House of Commons. I think that should satisfy everyone.
If the hon. Member supposes that I do not know the name of the Scottish Solicitor-General, it is Mr. Milligan.
We have not done so badly in Scotland. At the 1945 General Election they held their own.
