No, Sir. I think it is all run very fairly, with full agreement  between the heads of the various parties represented in the Government. We would not in any circumstances allow the stealing of marches and unfair tricks in a matter of this kind. We would be very glad to discuss the matter with all other parties.
The suggestion in the Question is that the other parties break it. I can only say that I trust that the Conservative Party will long remain a model in this respect.
Yes, Sir. But, of course, if they were in civilian clothes it might not be noticed.
