In view of the very complicated, lucid and lengthy statement of the Attorney-General, would it be more fitting and better all round to wait until 24th March to move the writ, and thus ward off the principal dangers that are likely to occur?
Would not the Prime Minister consider bringing the House together on this technical point? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I am asking the Prime Minister, and he can answer for himself. Will he not bring the House together on this point of allowing the 28 days to expire?
Not all of them.
What is the unusual and extraordinary hurry? Why 21 days and not 28 days? Surely it would be more natural to bring the whole House together—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] All right, you are not the masters now. Surely it would be more natural to bring the whole House together on the more reasonable and extended period.
Oh, no. The onus and the initiative lay with the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends who have created this vacancy.
