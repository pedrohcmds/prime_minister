When my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House opened a debate on this subject on 8th February he indicated the preliminary views of Her Majesty's Government and said that any observations made during the debate would be carefully considered. There was a useful exchange of views which the Government are examining. A further statement will be made as soon as possible.
