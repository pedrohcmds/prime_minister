I have already told the House in answer to a Question last week by the hon. Member that it is not in the public interest to give information about this committee or other committees connected with Secret Service, counteracting Fifth Column activities and the like. I take full responsibility for the control, character and composition of the committee, which contains among others a prominent trade union leader.
