There is another Question on that subject.
The proposals which I referred to in my statement the other day for associating Dominion representatives with the War Cabinet do not involve any change in the United Kingdom membership of the War Cabinet. The proposal of the Australian Government was that they should have a representative at the War Cabinet who should have the right to be heard in the formulation and direction of policy. I replied that we were in agreement with this proposal, and for a good many months past Sir Earle Page has been exercising these rights. We have informed the Governments of Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa that the same facilities are available for them if they wish to take advantage of them. We have as yet had no formal reply from New Zealand. I understand that Canada and South Africa are satisfied with the existing arrangements for consultation—indeed they expressed themselves strongly an this point—and do not at present wish to attach special representatives to the War Cabinet here.
Giving advice is having a say in the decision. It is not the custom to decide these matters by counting heads.
So far as I gather, the request of the Australian Government makes no change in what has actually been going on here since Sir Earle Page arrived, and been going on with very satisfactory results.
