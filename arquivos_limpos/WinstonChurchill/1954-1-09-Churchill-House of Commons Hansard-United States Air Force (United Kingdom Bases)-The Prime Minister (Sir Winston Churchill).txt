As I have previously informed the House, the arrangement for United States Air Force use of bases in this country will continue so long as it is needed in the general interest of world peace and security. The British contribution this year to maintenance costs will be £17,500. Apart from this sum, the maintenance of the bases will be entirely a charge on United States funds. As regards the construction of the bases, this country's direct financial contribution is limited to £22½ million out of an estimated total expenditure of £125 million  spread over the years 1951 to 1955. The question of criminal jurisdiction over United States Service personnel will be dealt with by the Visiting Forces Act when it comes into force. In making our Civil Defence dispositions, we will naturally give special attention to places that are specially liable to atomic attack.
