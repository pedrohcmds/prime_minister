Perhaps the man has a C licence and cannot carry the empties himself.
Hear, hear.
I have it down in my notes.
Would the right hon. Gentleman rather I did not speak?
What was the date of the letter?
The letter was written after the White Paper was published? That was only a few days ago. Very often it is courteous to send a formal acknowledgment pending a more reasoned reply later on.
I am very glad to hear any reassurances of that kind, and I am willing to accept them for what they are worth. But we should certainly not be afraid to join issue with the party opposite on this ground. If the threat or act of public duty were taken seriously it would, of course, affect the value of the national property which we propose to sell.
The hon. Member is repeating smoking-room gossip.
Who are "they"?
Twelve thousand three hundred and forty-eight.
That is a dirty thing to say.
