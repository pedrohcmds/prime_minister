(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make with regard to the Fleet Air Arm.
Was it not possible for the Prime Minister to arrange to make this statement to the House at a time when we could have discussed it? The whole question of the co-ordination of Defence was debated last Monday, and in view of the length of time which these proceedings have taken, is it only just to-day that a decision has been come to?
Is it the view of the Prime Minister that the decision come to by the Government has definitely settled this controversy, and will he use his influence to prevent it being continued as an internecine warfare between the two Departments? If it has not been settled it is no use pretending that it has, and we shall have this constant firing between the Departments over and over again.
I am asking the Prime Minister whether he is going to use his authority to prevent this constant firing between the Departments which has been going on for years now to the detriment of the Services. If a decision had been come to, is he going to insist upon it being implemented by the Departments?
Is the Prime Minister aware that this matter has been settled before  and reopened again and again after settlement?
