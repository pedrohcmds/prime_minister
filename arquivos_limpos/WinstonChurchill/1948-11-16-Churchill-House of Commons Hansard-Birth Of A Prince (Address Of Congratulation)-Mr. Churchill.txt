It is refreshing to have our party quarrels broken into by so agreeable an interlude, and I am very proud that it falls to my lot, on behalf of the Conservative Party, His Majesty's official Opposition, to express wholehearted support of the Motion which the Prime Minister has moved. I congratulate him upon the appropriate terms and the well-chosen language in which he has commended this Address to us. I am glad that he has invited Privy Councillors on this side and in the Liberal Party, too, to accompany the representatives of the Government to carry this Address, should it be voted by the House, to Buckingham Palace. We shall accept the invitation with pleasure.
