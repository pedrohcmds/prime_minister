It is, of course, our duly on this side of the House to welcome any sign of repentance, however tardy and however partial it may be, and I certainly do not wish to discourage the right hon. Gentleman, by the questions I am going to ask him, from further efforts to pursue that stony but on the whole righteous path. We have urged the great inconvenience to which the public was subjected, and I should like to ask how it  was that these arrangements, which I must say seem to have been very carefully considered, could not have been thought out before striking the blow which caused immense disturbance and heavy internal loss to this country. Why should not all the thought, or a good part of the thought, contained in this statement have been expended in the Government Departments concerned, and the nation have had the benefit of a well-considered, carefully-considered scheme instead of the abrupt and crude cut?
Is not that a very serious statement, because people are now invited to take out licences and make their plans on the basis of the statement which has just been put forward? Let me say at once that every effort must be made to stamp out the black market; but supposing these efforts do not succeed in overcoming the ingenuity of those engaged in these evil practices, are we to assume that all this is to be swept away, when people have taken out licences and made their arrangementsâ€”that it will all be taken away? Would it not be better to say that this scheme will have at least a year's run?
I should like a direct answer to the point whether we may take it that this scheme will be given a run for a year.
