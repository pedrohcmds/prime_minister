As to people being profoundly shocked, of course some people are very hard up to find something to talk about. As to the question about Field Marshal Montgomery, I think the hon. Member is stealing a march on the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) who has already got a Question down for Thursday.
If the hon. Gentleman will put that on the Order Paper, I will give it very careful consideration.
