Much turns upon this: I do not understand what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. Here is a Report which we have received from the Boundary Commission. Where is the plan in it for dividing these big boroughs, or adding an additional seat, assuming that the Commission had recommended such a course?
Yes, but they enumerated them for the purpose of saying that they did not propose to divide them into two.
Where is that recommendation of detail as to how they should be divided?
Has there been a secret reference to the Commission, of which the House has not been made aware?
It is vital to our discussion to know the essential facts. Did the Boundary Commissioners, at the time they made this second report, trace out the lines of division of these 17 constituencies, or was that done afterwards?
They didn't?
When?
I am sorry to interrupt, but we must know where we are. I think that we are being misled. Why was this scheme for redistribution by the Boundary Commission not made public at the time when this report was made public?
What does the right hon. Gentleman mean by "had the division"? Did the Commissioners give him the report of how these boroughs should be divided before this report which I have been holding in my hand was laid before Parliament, or was there a request by the Government for a further suggestion on this matter?
Who found this, the Boundary Commission or the Government?

We are in Committee. [Interruption.] If hon. Members opposite think that they are going to knock us about to get their dirty racket through they are very much mistaken. Why was this information withheld? The Boundary Commission had nothing to do with it.
Is it not a fact that when the Boundary Commission presented its report, its functions were discharged, and in the main it has stated its opinion as to the fair distribution of the seats? Is it not a fact, also, that the Government desired to know whether the Boundary Commission would deal further with the matter, and were they not informed that the Commission could not act in a collective capacity any more? Were they not then reduced to obtaining the individual advice and opinion of former members of a Boundary Commission, which in this matter was defunct?
I think it is.
But they had neither collective nor statutory capacity except as individuals to advise after the functions defined by the Act of 1944 had been discharged.
