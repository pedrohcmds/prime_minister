It is very easy for the right hon. Gentleman to rise from his place and say that his opponent is absolutely and utterly wrong. As one most anxious to sit at his feet in the matter, might I ask him whether he would vouchsafe any reason for this sweeping contradiction? Why is it utterly and totally wrong? What is the point of bringing the King's Recommendation into this matter when it clearly is a House of Commons insistence upon the financial provisions being observed? Of course, the King's Assent has been required and is invariably required to the proposing of a money charge, but that was simply to prevent everybody getting up in all parts of the House and bidding for popularity by proposing to give away large sums from the Exchequer to their constituents or other people in whom they had an interest. There is no relation at all.
I also can only speak with the indulgence of the House but I trust that the magnanimity and generosity with which we have been called upon to treat the right hon. Gentleman on this occasion will find its reciprocation. I am bound to say that I think the right hon. Gentleman, the Leader of the House, has handled the matter in a very conciliatory and painstaking manner and one must recognise the fact that it would be inconvenient for the House if the Bill had to be reprinted and certainly could not be taken tomorrow. It would be a complete derangement of our business, and, therefore, one regrets that the procedure was adopted in the first instance, but it was adopted on the false assumption that the Bill would have an uncontested passage because it was comparatively unimportant. We are confronted with the dilemma of spoiling the arrangements for Business which have been set out. We have made very effectively our protest on the broad principle of not ignoring the financial provisions which are an essential part of our procedure, and having done that, and having received from the Leader of the House what I take to be a clear assurance that this is not to be a precedent for general application to our legislation, I think we should not find it necessary to divide the House against the Motion.
