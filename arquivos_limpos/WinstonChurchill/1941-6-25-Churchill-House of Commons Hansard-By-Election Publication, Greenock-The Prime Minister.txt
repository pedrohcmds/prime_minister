As to legal action, I can say nothing, but it is very common in by-elections for a lot of untruthful and tendentious statements to be put into circulation, and I should myself doubt whether any importance should be attached to such malicious vapourings.
Wide as is the sphere over which I am called upon to cast an eye, I am glad to say that it has nothing to do with the point mentioned by my hon. Friend.
I am assured that they are untrue. The hon. Gentleman, I understand, was present at a private conversation and more than a year afterwards gave his own version of the conversation which passed. In those circumstances I should think the utmost distrust should be placed upon any statement of the hon. Gentleman's.
No Sir, I see no need at all for further inquiries. A newspaper proprietor sees all sorts of people and hears all sorts of views, because that is his business, and I suppose that from time to time he gets ill-used by inventions being put about as to what has passed at private conversations.
