This brief discussion on the Adjournment is certainly not a time to go into merits, and although both the speakers who have addressed the House have recited certain charges that have been made, there has been no attempt to go into merits, and I certainly do not propose to do so. The Noble Lord has not attempted to go into merits. In fact I gather that his position is that he takes no responsibility for the charges. They may be true, they may be false, they may be exaggerated; but however it may be, he raises only the issue of principle, of Parliamentary usage and custom. As that is an important issue, I feel it my duty to deal with it myself, because although I am not the Father of the House I have been here a good deal longer than the Father.
