I do not wish to raise a long debate on this Motion. Everybody realises the great strain there has been on the Prime Minister and that he needs a rest, but there are other Ministers beside the Prime Minister, and I think it is important that this House should be kept in Session. The events that are proceeding in Central Europe to-day are being followed with great anxiety by this country, and with increasing disturbance of mind as reports come through. It is a mistake that this House should depart while matters are in such jeopardy, and it is desirable that we should keep the closest watch on events and get the fullest amount of information. I think that this House, although it may be tired, should have regard to the fact that it has its responsibilities and that we have taken on new responsibilities, whether by the guarantee which is to be embodied in a treaty, or whether under what we may call the moral guarantee which has been assumed on behalf of this country by the Prime Minister, and we ought to be here and watchful, doing our business. There is plenty of business to be done. While the Prime Minister is having his rest the House should continue to sit.
