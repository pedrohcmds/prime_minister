My hon. Friend will be aware that a Select Committee on National Expenditure was appointed by the House on 12th December last, to examine expenditure on services connected with the war and to report on economies. The investigations of this Committee covered staffing matters in all the principal Departments, and reports have been, and will, I have no doubt, continue to be, made.
