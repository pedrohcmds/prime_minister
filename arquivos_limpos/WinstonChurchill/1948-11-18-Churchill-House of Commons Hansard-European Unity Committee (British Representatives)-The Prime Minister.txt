I think the right hon. Gentleman is incorrect in two respects. The question of closer unity in Western Europe has been considered, not only by The Hague Conference, but by the Governments concerned, and very practical steps have been taken by this Government in that direction. Secondly, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had certain views with regard to The Hague Conference, but he was always strong in his support of the idea of Western European collaboration.
I do not understand that that is the fact at all.
I disagree with the right hon. Gentleman.
The right hon. Gentleman himself has suggested this danger with regard to the position of Sir Edward Bridges. It is really quite normal for Governments to employ civil servants when they have Government representatives going to a conference. I have never heard it suggested previously that, in the case of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden), if he was attending an international conference and took a civil servant with him, that therefore that civil servant was considered to be a Conservative. It is the right hon. Gentleman's own prejudice.
the phrase "controversial politics" comes entirely from the right hon. Gentleman. It is one of the right hon. Gentleman's curious prejudices that, if there happens to be a Labour Government, that is partisan, but, if there is a Conservative Government or a Government headed by himself, it is not partisan.
I have tried to explain to the right hon. Gentleman, in reply to the letter he was good enough to send me, that in the case of France there is a Government composed of many parties. It is not surprising, therefore, that they have representatives of those parties—[An HON. MEMBER: "And outside."] I also pointed out to him, and hon. Members will note this, that four of these members are not Members of Parliament or representatives of the Government directly. It must also be pointed out that there are no representatives of the Chief Opposition parties in France.
Yes, and General de Gaulle. The chief Opposition parties are not represented; therefore, the right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong in thinking that this is an all-party delegation; it is a delegation representative largely of the Governmental parties in France.
My hon. Friend is, of course, quite correct, and he realises that the work to be done here deals with practical questions. Therefore, we do not necessarily want to include a large number of orators from different parties.
I thought that was perfectly obvious. If the right hon. Gentleman has read, and I am sure he has, the terms of the communiqué, he will see that the remit to this committee is a wide one, to consider all kinds of methods. There is no suggestion that it is tied down to one party.
