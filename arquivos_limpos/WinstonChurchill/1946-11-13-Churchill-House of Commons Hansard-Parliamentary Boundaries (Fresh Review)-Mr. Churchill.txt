When was the decision taken that the Boundary Commission should proceed upon this basis? Was it not taken by His Majesty's present advisers?
Did not the Government, by Order in Council, bring this procedure into operation, on a certain basis?
Did not His Majesty's Government, when bringing before the House that Resolution to enforce the Order in Council, have in mind all the circumstances relating to the state of the register; and were they not responsible for considering the effect of the so-called rigidity, or lack of elasticity, in the Act of Parliament?
Is it not a fact that this Bill which was passed at the time of the National Coalition was framed, devised, introduced and carried by the present Lord President of the Council, who is a master of all electioneering tactics, and who has already been described by his colleague the Minister of Health as a "second rate Tammany boss"?
May I be permitted to dissociate myself from that slur on the Lord President of the Council? May I ask the Home Secretary whether this is not a case of an Act of Parliament having been maturely considered by a subsequent Government and then put into operation by a deliberate and measured Parliamentary procedure; and, because the results are unfavourable to the interests of the Socialist Party, the whole process has to be begun over again? Is this not a case of flagrant and shameful gerrymandering?
I need scarcely say that it is no' part of my desire or intention to argue such a matter with the Chair, but I reserve my full right to argue it with Ministers of the Crown. May I not submit that it is quite true that in this, as  in every other redistribution scheme, Members of all parties are adversely affected, and that they cry out when they are adversely affected? If there are these cries from both sides, would it not be better to allow the decision of the Commission, arrived at on grounds and by procedure approved by the Government, to come into effect; and is it not vitiating the whole principle of a redistribution system if, because a number of Socialist pocket boroughs in London, including the Prime Minister's, happen to be disfranchised, the whole business of going through this procedure should be begun again? It is merely a plan of "heads I win, tails you lose."
On the matter of redistribution, there has always been certain contact between both sides of the House —it certainly was so in 1885, which is an example I can quote—and the Measure to which this proposal relates was the product of Coalition Government consultation. May I ask why, at a time when the Government, unknown to us, have consulted Mr. Speaker upon these matters, no communication was made to this side of the House about a matter, on which, hitherto, we had all been united? Why was not that done?
Am I right in assuming that the Government openly admit they were in error in introducing the Measure on the lines they did, and in persuading the House to pass the Resolution? Do they admit it is the case, that they were in error?
Will His Majesty's Government bear in mind the very great importance, in matters of electoral distribution and electoral reform, of the principles which have so often guided us, of good faith and fair play between all parties in the State, who are affected? Does not the course they have now adopted, wittingly or unwittingly, intentionally or' unintentionally, expose them to the charge of upsetting a verdict which they think detrimental to their party interests?
Charge, not insinuation.
Is it not a fact that consultations were avoided because the right hon. Gentleman was pursuing, or the Government were pursuing, a course which could only be justified on purely party grounds?
rose—
I also rise to a point of Order for the purpose of addressing, with all proper respect, the Chair, after what you, Sir, have said. I need not say that nothing that has come from me, or from any of my Friends on this side of the House, reflects in the slightest degree on your impartiality, or on the impartiality  of the Commission. I must submit to you as a matter of Order, that the point we were pressing was not that the Commission had not proceeded impartially and properly and without political interference upon the lines and the basis assigned to them, but that, because the results were unsatisfactory to the majority in this House and to the Government, therefore the work had to be begun over again.
