Yes, Sir. I am visiting President Truman shortly in Washington in order to discuss with him and the Prime Minister of Canada the problems to which the discovery of atomic energy has given rise. I have invited the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J. Anderson), who is Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, to accompany me in an advisory capacity, and he has been good enough to accept.
That is another question.
I hope there may be a discussion in due course, but at the present moment I think we had better have conversations first.
I think it is better to take these things by stages.
