If the Question is not in order and cannot be put to the Minister of Works, would it not be possible after the publicity which has now been given to it for the Minister of Works to make the necessary recommendations through the appropriate channel?
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of Works and the Lord President of the Council whether it would not be convenient after a few more weeks have passed, to find an afternoon for a discussion in which all opinions upon the many virtues and some defects of this new Chamber could be expressed?
