I presume, Mr. Speaker, that apart from the topics covered by that Motion, the Debate on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House will enjoy the usual freedom.
I should like to ask the Under-Secretary what is to happen supposing we separate, as we have decided to do, at four o'clock to-morrow, and he has not got an answer by them. Will there be any method by which this information is to be conveyed? It is an extremely important point. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman opposite. Here was a case of absolutely no reciprocity. A question was asked about it, and the Government are making the necessary representations. They admit that it is a matter of extreme importance, but we are separating to-morrow. Can the hon. Gentleman hold out to us any hope that he will be in a position to give us information upon this subject to-morrow?
May I then, because Parliamentary time is very precious and we are here for only a short period—
On a point of Order. May I ask your ruling whether in fact I have attempted to intervene at all except by way of interrogation, which is not at all the same as an intervention?
