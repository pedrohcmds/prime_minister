May I ask the Prime Minister a supplementary question and also take this opportunity of congratulating him on the honour which has been bestowed upon him? The supplementary question I should like to ask is whether, as I understand that there is to be a debate on foreign affairs next week, he would take the opportunity of perhaps enlarging on the subject matter of this discussion?
