I really submit to you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that I do not knock people about, concerning their personal private affairs, or attack their private  business. If that has to be done, it should be done in a formal manner, just as, when there is a difference with the Chair, there is a formal method by which that matter can be raised. There are no secrets in this House, and there ought not to be. I heard the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House declare that he is fully armed with a brief which he will explode against my right hon. Friend. I think that, in making a statement of that kind, he should either stop short, or go much further.
rose—
I want to raise this matter. I cannot say that it is a matter of Order, but it is a matter of procedure.

MEMBERS:"NO."] On this point, which I submit to you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, I suggest that personal charges reflecting upon my right hon. Friends in their individual capacities should certainly not be excluded from our discussions, but should be made on the proper occasion, with proper notice and with all the formalities attaching to that class of attack.
On a point of Order. Am I to gather from your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, that general comments in Debate cannot be made, unless they are first put through the agency of the Chair?
The right hon. Gentleman had that written down beforehand.
What about what they say?
