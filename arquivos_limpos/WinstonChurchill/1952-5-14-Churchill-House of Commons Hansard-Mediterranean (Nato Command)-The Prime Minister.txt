I do not think I should add to the statement which I have  made. At the present time the conversations are on a staff level, but it may well be that agreement will be reached. On the other hand, agreement may not be reached. The question of the nationality of the commander is quite separate from these staff discussions.
Yes. The reason is that the discussions are now proceeding on a staff level, which may end the whole matter. If not, the Governments will be drawn in, and other decisions will have to be taken.
On the contrary, my conscience is absolutely easy. I do not feel in any danger of selling the pass, considering that the largest pass was sold by the right hon. Gentleman.
That is a very inadequate representation of the views which I expressed at great length and which I have here fully on this subject.
No, thank you very much. I should be delighted to refer the right hon. Gentleman to HANSARD: I wonder his curiosity has not already led him to investigate. The situation now is different from what it was a year ago. Very important decisions were taken by the right hon.  Gentleman and his colleagues which we must take into consideration in dealing with future circumstances.
I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman realises that he is passing a very strict, direct, pointed and severe censure upon the former Minister of Defence, who quite gratuitously the other day, on these grave matters, introduced such a disgusting expression as "selling the pass" and tried, with conspicuous ill success, to fasten it on to me.
