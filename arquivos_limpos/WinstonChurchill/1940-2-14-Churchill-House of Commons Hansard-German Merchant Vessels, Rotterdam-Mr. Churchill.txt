The hon. Member's statement is not in accordance with the information I have received; but, in any case, he will be aware that the coast lines of Holland and Germany are contiguous. It is not from any lack of zeal or thought that any enemy vessels have so far escaped capture or destruction.
I am not certain of the actual facts which the hon. Gentleman  has mentioned; but, naturally, the whole of this subject is under constant examination by the naval authorities, and our wishes in the matter conform exactly to his own.
We try to acquire information from various sources; but at any time when the hon. Gentleman has any additional information to give, he has only to mention it.
No one would expect us to be able to maintain a close patrol or close blockade off the German coast, having regard to the enormous development of shore-based aircraft since the last war.
