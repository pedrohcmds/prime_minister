I am looking forward to seeing the hon. and gallant Gentleman make a gesture of which it can be said that it is at any rate not less hollow.
It is not customary to include the staff of any Department or branch in the salary of the Minister. In this case the Minister does not draw any salary at all.
There is absolutely no relationship between the salaries paid to Ministers and the staffs of the various Departments of State which were so grossly and outrageously increased by the right hon. Gentleman.
I think the hon. Member is a judge of cheap demagogic gestures, but they do not often come off when he makes them.
The right hon. Gentleman is no doubt trying to live up to the cheap demagogic gestures mentioned by his hon. Friend.
