We naturally accept and support the report which you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, have made upon this matter and I was very glad to hear the remarks which were made in such a becoming strain by the Leader of the  House. From the information which has reached me, it appears that several Ministers of high standing and importance in the Government took an active part in those proceedings. I am not mentioning their names because of the terms of the remarks by the Leader of the House, but it does appear they did take a part and I trust we may assume they are included among those who have apologised to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East for their unparliamentary and improper behaviour.
