No German airmen have been buried at Blyth. Two unidentified bodies of unknown nationality which were washed ashore on 14th February and 6th March respectively were buried by the local civil authorities in accordance with the usual practice. The naval authorities always endeavour to provide proper funeral ceremonies for British naval personnel who lose their lives at sea, and I am asking that during the war this practice shall be extended as widely as possible to cover the kind of case the hon. Member has in mind.
I am glad that the hon. Member put the Question down. It is certainly one which requires attention.
Yes, Sir. I intended my reply to apply not only to the regular personnel of the Navy, but to the large number of British seamen who are risking their lives every day in the North Sea in essential measures for our protection. I cannot guarantee that there will be available at every port and at all times a naval firing party, but we will do the best we can to make it available for all these cases which the hon. Member has in mind. May I express my obligation that the matter has been brought forward in this way?
I cannot add to what I have said, but I entirely agree with the hon. Member.
