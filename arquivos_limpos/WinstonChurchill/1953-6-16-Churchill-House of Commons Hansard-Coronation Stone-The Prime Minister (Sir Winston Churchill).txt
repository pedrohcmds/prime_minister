The Coronation Stone has been in Westminster Abbey for over 650 years. It has a special significance for all countries in the Commonwealth, which was strongly reinforced by the Coronation which has just taken place. The decision to restore the Stone to its  customary position in the Abbey, the traditional place of Coronation, commanded wide acceptance on both sides of the border; and it is not the intention of Her Majesty's present advisers to recommend any change.
