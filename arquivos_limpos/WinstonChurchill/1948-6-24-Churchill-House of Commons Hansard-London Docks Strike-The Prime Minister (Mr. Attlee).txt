There is little to add to yesterday's statement. The task of dealing with perishable foods is duly proceeding to the requirements of the Ministry of Food. Work is also proceeding on the part of some of the workers at Surrey, Blackfriars, West India and Tooley Street Docks and efforts are being made to obtain a fuller resumption of work. It is clear that the continued strike is the only bar to an examination of any grievances that may be felt. I would ask that I should not be pressed for any further statement this afternoon.
