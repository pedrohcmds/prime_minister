The Prime Minister has detailed to us the event in this very serious time, and in his closing words he has put before us very grave considerations. This has been for all of us a week-end of great strain, and I fully appreciate the need on this occasion, on every occasion, to speak with the utmost restraint and with a full sense of responsibility. We are face to face with events grave in themselves, which may lead us far to still graver events. We have first of all to see the passing, or what looks like the passing, of a great historic State, Austria. For the last two decades Austria has survived in a truncated condition and during the last decade has been a pawn in the rivalries of great Powers. She has not been a free agent. Her Government has been influenced now by the dictator of Italy, now by the dictator of Germany. She has been pulled now by one and now by the other of these two great Powers, and she has been torn, too, by rival emotions. On the one side the people have a natural affinity with their fellow Germans across the frontier. On the other hand they had the desire to preserve their great cultural heritage.
I did not suggest bringing immediately the particular point of Austria before the League. What I suggested  was that the League of Nations should be called together to see that the League shall stand firm against any continuation of this policy of aggression.
I did not suggest that this particular case should be brought before the Council or the Assembly. My point was that it was time to call the League together to consider the position of the world in view of this action and to avoid possible future actions of this kind.
I would ask the hon. Gentleman not to misquote me constantly. He has misquoted me three times. I stated my position perfectly clearly. What I was envisaging was the position of the world to-day and the question of whether now was not the time to try to draw together all the peace-loving States. I never advocated the use of force at this moment.
