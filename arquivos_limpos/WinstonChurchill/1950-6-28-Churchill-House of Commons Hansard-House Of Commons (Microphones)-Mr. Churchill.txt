May I be permitted to add that, personally, I was a little concerned in raising the matter. On Monday, I thought that the microphone was much more powerful than it had been before, and my opinion was shared by a number of hon. Members with whom I talked. It causes a reverberation which makes it very difficult for the speaker to modulate his voice in accordance with the accidents of Debate. Therefore, I asked my right hon. Friend the Chief Opposition Whip whether there had been any change, and he told me that the microphone had been geared up over the weekend and made more strong. All I asked was whether there could be a return to the normal practice of last week, and the previous week before I spoke. But, by some error, it was turned off altogether. I hope I made myself heard to the House, and I make my apologies to the "gods" in the Gallery for any inconvenience they may have suffered.
