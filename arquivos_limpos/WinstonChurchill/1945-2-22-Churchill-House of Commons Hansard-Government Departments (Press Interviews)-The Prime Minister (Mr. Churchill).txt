The best practice is that Ministers of the Crown should themselves expound all matters of Government policy, and that Press interviews by officials should only be given on Ministerial responsibility and after due authorisation by the political chief. Such expressions of opinion by officials would, usually, have regard to technical aspects only. Of course, in an emergency, exceptions may be made. The principle of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament is paramount.
