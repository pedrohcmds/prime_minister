Two years ago we borrowed another £1,000 million sterling from them, or nearly four billion dollars. I asked the other day a rhetorical question, "What are dollars?" Dollars are the result of the toil and the skill of the American working man, and he is willing to give them on a very large scale to the cause of rebuilding our broken world. In many cases he gives them without much prospect of repayment. Shabby moneylenders!
I am capable of deciding for myself. That evil can always be corrected by production. Where prices rise in spite of abundance, it is not a sign of evil, but often of strength. It must have been a heart-shaking decision of the American Government and of the President, who has great executive power, to abandon price controls and, as it were, throw the reins upon the horse's neck. The strong horse is pulling the wagon out of the mire. I know what many hopes are on the opposite side of the House, but they will not be cheered by the results. We have a strong horse too. He is not so large but he is strong. Alas, he is bitted and bridled and hobbled and haltered till he can hardly move.
I merely recited the history of those days, and that is the latest precedent which is available upon the subject.
It must be clear-almost clear enough for the right hon. Gentleman, even in his most comprehending moments. The object and spirit of the Parliament Act was not to enable the House of Lords to veto the will of the people, but to make sure that the will of the people was, in fact, made effective. For this purpose the life of a House of Commons was reduced from seven to five years, and a provision was inserted to enable a Bill to be carried forward under the Parliament Act procedure across a General Election. The Dissolution of Parliament in no way affects the efficacy of the Parliament Act. No Government are hampered by it in carrying through their legislation unless they are afraid that the people will not support them at the polls. The fact that the Government now wish to shorten the term of the suspensory powers of the second Chamber proves conclusively that they fear they would be defeated at a General Election. What they are, therefore, trying to do is not to give effect to the will of the people, but to carry through their party legislation irrespective of the will of the people. This is not democracy. It is  authoritarianism. [An HON. MEMBER: "What an incredible muddle."] I quite understand that may be the hon. Member's condition. Total powers are to be given to any Government obtaining power at a General Election, no matter how abnormal the conditions of that election, to carry whatever legislation they choose during their five years spell, irrespective of whether the people wish for that legislation, and irrespective of whether the Government still have their confidence or not.
We will come to that in a minute. What is now proposed is, virtually, single-chamber Government, and the granting to the Cabinet, which already has taken it in time of peace, the whole of the arbitrary wartime powers and regulations—a monstrous invasion of our liberties and a vile breach of faith between man and man who have to work together. What they are now proposing to do is to obtain for the Cabinet irresistible power to pass any Measures they may wish to bring forward, without regard to the will of the people or to their own foundation in public confidence. This is a formidable issue to fling out at this time of economic crisis—at this time when, in full peace, despotic wartime powers are ruling—and to be flung out, not as a result of grave historic and prolonged constitutional controversies, but as a cheap, paltry, disreputable deal between jarring nonentities in a divided Administration.
The Lord President ought to be pleased about that.
They said all would be much better.
The right hon. Gentleman is not quoting me?
It is not a bit like me: [Laughter.]
I am glad that things are looking up there.
Will the right hon. Gentleman be so kind as to allow me to direct his attention also to the comparison which I made, because after the first world war there was no havoc by bombing? There were not a million houses knocked down, and hardly any damage here. I do not remember that housing was at that time one of the leading questions. We had many other matters, and grave labour questions, but I do not think there is any comparison between that situation and this, when we have a million houses destroyed. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why, not now but even in the year 1949, only 140,000 houses are to be constructed here, with all our efforts, when before the war, with no particular effort at all, just in the normal working, as many as 350,000 houses were completed?
No. I said that if certain conditions were fulfilled and" among them, a blood bath was avoided, then I was free to give my congratulations.
The right hon. Gentleman should realise that Palestine is a mandated area, and as he and his colleagues have broken their pledges to the Zionists, there was no moral reason why we should not, and every practical reason why we should, give the Mandate back to the United Nations organisation.  There is a great difference between British territory built up and held for generations and a Mandate which we accepted
There is nothing in the Parliament Act about that.
The right hon. Gentleman must be very hard up to find something to say. Since when have I been in favour of the House of Lords having the power of Dissolution? I have never heard of such a doctrine and I should be absolutely opposed to it. They have a control given them by Parliament over legislation, but they have absolutely no power to determine the length of the sittings of this House, nor when there should be an appeal to the country.
I must really clear the right hon. Gentleman's mind. If a Measure is sent back under the suspensory veto of the House of Lords, there is no obligation upon the Government to go to the country. There is no obligation to go to the country before the expiration of their full normal term, and they lose nothing by that because the procedure of the Parliament Act carries on properly.
