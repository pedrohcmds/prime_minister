Hon. Members will now be aware of the Government's plans for release from the Armed Forces after the cessation of hostilities in Europe, which were set out in the White Paper published a few days ago. Special arrangements have been made to ensure that the details of the release scheme are fully explained to all members of the Forces with as little delay as possible. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour is in consultation with representatives of employers and workers on plans for the re-allocation of men and women employed in civilian war work, and an announcement will be made as soon as possible.
