Merchant ships built by the Admiralty will be delivered to the Ministry of Shipping, who will make arrangements for their management. Vessels now building for private owners will not, so far as can at present be foreseen, be transferred to Government ownership but will be subject to requisition or other control by the Minister of Shipping.
We build for the Ministry of Shipping and we transfer the ships when built to the Ministry, and they arrange what the future of these ships is to be.
In my view the ultimate fate of these ships rest with the Ministry of Shipping.
Certainly, that is what it is for.
I am aware of the figures referred to by the hon. Member.  The position is that all available shipbuilding berths in South Shields are occupied with merchant ship building orders. The volume of ship repair work is bound to fluctuate and the policy is to spread such work over the country as far as possible. The facilities at South Shields will be fully borne in mind both for repair work and naval conversion work. All will be needed. The January unemployment figure at South Shields in this industry fell to 521.
I am quite sure that every yard and every man are going to be used to the utmost capacity.
He has almost everything to do with it. In answer to the hon. Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell), I am sure the whole capacity available will have to be used.
The answer to both parts of the Question is in the negative. There is no intention of preventing shipbuilding on private account, and the Admiralty is responsible for issuing licences for this purpose.
