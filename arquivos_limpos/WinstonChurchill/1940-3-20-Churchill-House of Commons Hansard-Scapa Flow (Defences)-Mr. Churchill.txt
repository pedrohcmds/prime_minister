The defences of Scapa Flow and of all naval bases are reviewed  constantly in particular relation to the results of enemy attack. We must probably expect attacks of this kind as a regular feature of the war in the coming months, and we shall do our best to resist them and to return them. The evident desire of the enemy to portray this petty and ill-directed raid on Scapa Flow as an important military affair is significant and encouraging.
I think a very good arrangement exists, and there is the closest liaison between the three Services.
