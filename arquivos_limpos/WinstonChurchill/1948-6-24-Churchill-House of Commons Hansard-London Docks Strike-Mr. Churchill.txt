Could the right hon. Gentleman, who has asked us not to press the matter now, state what is the nature of the impending or current negotiations which are going forward which requires him to say that this matter ought not to be discussed now? We have had this same reason given day after day, but the strike has continued, and I think some more precise and substantial reason should be given to us if we are not to press for this matter to be further considered at the present time.
We are separating tomorrow for the weekend, and no Adjournment can be moved after this afternoon until next Monday, and that is four more days added to, I think, 12. If there are 150 ships accumulating and awaiting discharge, why, after all this, should not the full strength of what are called Service personnel be used to unload these ships and procure the clearance of the port and a cessation of the paralysis which grips it at present? Some sort of reason ought to be given us, though we do not want to have an awkward discussion which would embarrass the Government. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman in refusing to give way to the demands made against the legitimate trade union, but we really ought to have something more solid than has been given to us so far.
