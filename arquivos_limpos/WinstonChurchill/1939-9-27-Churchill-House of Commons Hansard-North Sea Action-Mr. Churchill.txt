I am obliged to my right hon. Friend for putting this question. The Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Sir Charles Forbes, has wirelessed as follows: 
I might have added that another German aircraft came down in the North Sea. We sent out a destroyer to collect her, and her crew of four are being brought in as prisoners.
I learned about it about three-quarters of an hour ago, and I thought that the House should know of it.
