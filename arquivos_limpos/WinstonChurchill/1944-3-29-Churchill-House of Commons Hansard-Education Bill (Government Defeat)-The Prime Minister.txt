No, Sir, I am afraid I cannot, in any way, alter the statement which I have made. It is really impossible to distinguish between votes on domestic policy and votes on the general policy of the war, in this country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] His Majesty's Government are entirely in the hands of the House, which has the fullest authority of any legislative assembly in the world, and we trust it will use it with responsibility.
I was making a statement on the Business of the House, and I think it would be very wrong for the Government to be the first of all Governments to be deprived of the facility of making statements. However, after my statement is finished, the Adjournment of the House will be moved, and if it is thought that a discussion on that Adjournment is likely to lessen the tension which prevails, there will be nothing in the attitude of the Government to prevent it taking place.
As an old Member of the House, I should have thought that it was, obviously, an issue which required the widest latitude that the Chair felt inclined to give, when the Chair would be supported, as it certainly would be, by the general sense of the Committee. With regard to the question asked of me by my right hon. Friend opposite, I entirely share his views that it would be a great pity to have what he called a ragged and stormy Debate to-day. But that is not a matter for us to settle. We have to wipe out the Business to-day and that can only be done by moving the Adjournment of the House.
That will undoubtedly be decided in the Division.
I hesitate to make declarations about the future, until or unless we have been fortified by a Vote of Confidence. But I should not have any hesitation in hazarding the suggestion that every Amendment must be judged on its merits and in the relation which it has to the general policy of the Government.
I cannot attempt to control the activities of hon. Members. I can offer them merely some suggestions as to the consequences which may attend their actions, but certain I am that we cannot go on on the present basis—with a Government which has been defeated after the language which was used from this bench, in spite of the very great task which lies immediately ahead of us—that we could not possibly do. As to the course which individual Members take on every Amendment, on every question, they must consult their consciences and their duty.
