On behalf of the Opposition, I desire to support 'this Motion, which has been moved in such fitting language by the Prime Minister. I was in this House with Colonel Clifton Brown for almost all his public service. He was most notably a man who was the friend of other Members. I think that particularly commended him when a choice was needed for the Deputy Chairman. He served a comparatively short period of apprenticeship and then came into the Chair, as the Prime Minister has said, in all the stress of war.
