I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way to me for a moment. The reason we have not felt entirely comfortable about what he has said is that he is always saying, "We have doubled this; we have doubled that," without our knowing what "this" is. He says that we have made a 40 per cent. increase. On what? On x, and so on. Now he used two phrases, that there would be a considerable improvement and that there would be really large-scale production; but none of these things has anything definite in it. He must excuse a certain amount of scepticism and doubt where there is no foundation given, no datum line from which the multiplication takes place.
What does that mean?
The right hon. Gentleman said something about the conditions at the beginning of the last war. It must be remembered that the Air Force that won the Battle of Britain and saved our lives was one which was entirely set on foot, and the squadrons and the machines and everything organised, before 1940.
