The Prime Minister has every right in this matter to speak on behalf of the whole House. On behalf of the Conservative Party, I wish to say that we associate ourselves fully with the spirit and the words of the statement he has just made to us. We share to the full the deep regret which he has expressed at the news this morning's newspapers contained. We share also the inevitable disappointment which will be felt in Australia and in New Zealand, but we are quite sure that there is only one paramount duty immediately incumbent upon His Majesty's Ministers, and that is to advise the King to rest and give himself, in the prime of life as he is, every possible chance of recovering his full strength.
