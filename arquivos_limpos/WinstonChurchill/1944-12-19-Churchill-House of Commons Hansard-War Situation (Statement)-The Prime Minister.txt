Well, Sir, a great battle is proceeding now, and I should certainly think that, when we meet again after Christmas, it would be appropriate that we should review the scene, not only in one theatre, but widely.

This question of the temporary news black-out on the Western front is one for the Supreme Commander to settle. We, of course, support him.
