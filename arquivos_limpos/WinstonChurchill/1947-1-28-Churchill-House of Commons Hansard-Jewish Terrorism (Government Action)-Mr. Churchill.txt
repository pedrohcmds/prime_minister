I am not quite sure whether the right hon. Gentleman did' not suggest that the death sentence upon this Jew had been respited on account of the hostages which had been taken by the Jewish terrorists. If that were so,  I should like to ask: Is it not a very serious thing to turn aside from the normal path of justice because of threats of murder by terrorists launched against hostages whom they have taken?
There has been no departure from the normal procedure as a result of terrorist activities?
