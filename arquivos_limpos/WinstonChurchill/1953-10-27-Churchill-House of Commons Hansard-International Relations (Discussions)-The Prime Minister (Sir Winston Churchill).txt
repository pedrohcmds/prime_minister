The desirability of establishing easier and more friendly relations with the Soviet Government is common ground between both sides of the House. I myself have made various suggestions on the subject. Every proposal must be judged in relation to the circumstances at the time. I do not think that matters will be helped forward by repeated Questions and answers in the House of Commons. I gave a carefully considered reply on 20th October, and nothing has occurred since which enables me to add to it; but if I have at any time any information to give the House, I can assure the hon. Members who have raised the matter that I shall seek the earliest opportunity to do so.
