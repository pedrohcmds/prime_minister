In view of the opinion which you, Sir, have just expressed that my hon. Friend has made out a prima facie case, I think the proper way to handle this matter would be to refer it to the Commitee of Privileges. Therefore, I beg to move: 
There seems to be some misunderstanding, or some attempt on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to raise some side issue. [Interruption.] I will put it in this way, that the Leader of the Opposition appears to think that the proceedings of this Court of Inquiry are somehow connected directly with instructions given to it by the Government. If so, that is a misunderstanding. I assume that for the setting up of the Court of Inquiry the Secretary of State for War is technically responsible, but in a case of this kind, where there has been divulgence of information which is alleged to be a breach of the Official Secrets Act, it would be an automatic proceeding to set up a Court of Inquiry.
Once the court has been set up, the proceedings do not come under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State himself, still less of the Government. They are carried on by the court.
I do not propose to follow the hon. Gentleman opposite in discussing a question which, I take it, will be before the Committee of Privileges. With regard to what the hon. Baronet the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) has said, there again I think he is under some misunderstanding. A Court of Inquiry set up by the Army Council is not an inquiry into any charges against my hon. Friend the Member for Nonvood (Mr. Sandys). It is to inquire into charges made against another officer who may have divulged secret information. I cannot see that there is anything indecent in the Army Council having set up an inquiry which in the ordinary course would go into a charge of that kind.
