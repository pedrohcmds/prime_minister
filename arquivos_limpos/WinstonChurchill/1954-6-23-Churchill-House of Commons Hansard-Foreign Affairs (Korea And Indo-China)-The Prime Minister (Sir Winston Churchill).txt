Does not my hon. Friend think that it is a rather fine thing on the part of Members of this Committee and members of former Governments that they should adhere to great acts of policy in which they have been concerned even after they ceased to be responsible, even if there is no popularity to be got out of them? I have paid compliments to those who have gained a great deal of help and support from Dr. Adenauer and have not cast acts of faith away as if they were worth nothing.
