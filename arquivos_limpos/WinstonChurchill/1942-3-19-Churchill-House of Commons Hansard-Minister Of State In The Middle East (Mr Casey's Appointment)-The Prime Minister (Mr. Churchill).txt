I thought it would be to the convenience of the House if I made this announcement at this moment. His Majesty has been pleased to approve the appointment of the right honourable Richard Gardiner Casey, D.S.O., M.C., to be Minister of State. Mr. Casey will be a member of the War Cabinet of the United Kingdom, and will represent the War Cabinet in the Middle East, where he will concert, on their behalf, the measures necessary for the prosecution of the war in that area, other than the conduct of operations. Mr. Casey will be described as Minister of State in the Middle East. Mr. Casey is at present Australian Minister in Washington; and I wish, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, to express our thanks to the Commonwealth Government for their consent to release Mr. Casey at this juncture from his important duties in the United States.
