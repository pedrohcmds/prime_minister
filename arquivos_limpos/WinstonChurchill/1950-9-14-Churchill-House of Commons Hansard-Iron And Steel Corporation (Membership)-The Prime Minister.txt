The intention was to refer the right hon. Gentleman to a statement which my right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply will be making today.
I said "today."
Yes, and therefore we are carrying out what was passed by Parliament. We are carrying out the Act, and I quite agree that, if the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the Leader of the Opposition will wholeheartedly support this, we shall get rid of controversy.
The right hon. Gentleman is now rather anticipating a future Debate and harking back to a past one. I did explain then that I did not think it was the practice of this House to try to evaluate how the votes cast in an election are affected by what had been done in a previous Parliament.
I would point out that since then there have been some remarkable advances, retirements and side-stepping on the subject of the control of the steel industry by the Conservative Party.
