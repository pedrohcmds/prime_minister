Cannot any hon. Member raise a point of Order?
I suggest that the position is this. What is before the House is the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend. The right hon. Gentleman, in speaking to that Amendment, indicated that he was proposing to move an Amendment to the Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) has explained that, as far as we are concerned, the proposed Amendment to the Amendment will not meet our position at all and that, therefore, we are persisting in our Amendment and intend to take it to a vote. Therefore, in my submission the Debate should continue on the Amendment which we wish the House to adopt.
What the right hon. Gentleman said went very far to meet the difficulty which many of us have felt. Our objection to the Amendment as put forward by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) had relation to the question of binding this House to a decision here and now to accept partition; this is putting it shortly. Our intention was to accept the general policy; we did not want this House, when it came back, to be met with a Govern-  ment saying: "You sent us off with a Mandate to the Commission and tied us down to the acceptance of partition." Our point has been not in any way to try to get a party vote on this subject. We are solely concerned with having the best possible way of meeting this position in the interests of the Arab people, the Jewish people and the whole world. If this House is not tied at this moment to acceptance of the principle of the White Paper, the Government are, of course, free to take action. That is a way I think this House will want.
