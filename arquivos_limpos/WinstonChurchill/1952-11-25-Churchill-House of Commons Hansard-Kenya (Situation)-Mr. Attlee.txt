May I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that while we must guard against abuse of the use of this Standing Order, it is essential that its use should be guarded in proper cases. I find it a little difficult to understand why, because there is a continuing series of events, if some particular event comes into prominence it should not be raised. If that is so, it seems to me that at any time when there were disturbances in the Colonies, Ireland, or anywhere else—or even an industrial dispute like that at Tonypandy—one would be precluded from raising one particular issue because of the continuance of the trouble.
Further to that point of order. Is it not within your recollection, Mr. Speaker, that on a number of occasions when this question has been put forward it has always been possible to submit reasons to Mr. Speaker for his consideration without in any way suggesting that we are controverting his Ruling?
