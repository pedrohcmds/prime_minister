The House will have learned with horror and regret of the assassination of His late Majesty King Abdullah of the Jordan. I feel confident that hon. Members on both sides will wish to be associated with His Majesty's Government in expressing their deepest sympathy with all those who have been bereaved in consequence of this senseless crime.
