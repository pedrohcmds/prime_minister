Will the right hon. Gentleman be prepared to make a statement on this when we have a Debate on defence next week? Would he be prepared to make a statement on this point?
I am astonished that the right hon. Gentleman, who is Minister of Defence, does not know of the repeated and often public demands we have made for a Debate, either in secret Session, or, failing that, in open Session. Has he not heard of any of that?
I do not wish to ask a hypothetical question and so I will not hang it on the Debate, but will the right hon. Gentleman be prepared to make some answer to this question if we put it to him next week?
It is not "natural curiosity" to try to know to what extent one's country is being shamefully let down.
