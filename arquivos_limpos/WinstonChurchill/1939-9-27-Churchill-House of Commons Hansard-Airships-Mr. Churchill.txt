During the last war the Admiralty built over 200 airships, including a large fleet of Zeppelins and 10 airship stations. Except for the useful patrolling work of the little Blimps around the harbours they were not otherwise of much military value. To-day the Admiralty possess no airships, but in view of their small offensive value against submarines, and their extreme vulnerability to attacks from enemy aircraft and from the anti-aircraft armament of U-boats, there is no need to deplore our deficiency in this respect.
