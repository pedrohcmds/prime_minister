It has not been found possible to find the text of any message sent by me to Field Marshal Montgomery in May, 1945, concerning captured German arms. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find it. I will, of course, publish in the OFFICIAL REPORT any result should it be achieved. I certainly proposed around this time that the destruction of captured German arms should be delayed and my telegrams have been published. With regard to Question No. 51, in the name of the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Warbey), Field Marshal Montgomery has also reported to me that no arrangements of this kind were ever discussed between him and Field Marshal von Busch and no German armed forces were maintained in being after their unconditional surrender.
