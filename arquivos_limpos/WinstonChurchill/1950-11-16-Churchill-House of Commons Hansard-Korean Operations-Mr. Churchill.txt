We all thank God our losses have been no heavier than those mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman. We certainly concur with him in expressing a tribute to those who lost their lives, and the deep sympathy of the whole House to their relations and families. In view of the fact that the United States losses have been perhaps 200 times as great, would not it be well also for us to express our sympathy with their families and relations in the great sacrifices they have made in the common cause?
May I also ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he and the Foreign Secretary will constantly bear in mind the great importance of our not becoming, and of our Allies so far as we can influence their actions not becoming, too much pinned down in China or in the approaches to China at a time when the danger in Europe is undoubtedly occupying all our minds?
Would it not be very much better to reserve these questions which touch on foreign policy, for the debate we are going to have on that matter?
It would not take the right hon. Gentleman long.
