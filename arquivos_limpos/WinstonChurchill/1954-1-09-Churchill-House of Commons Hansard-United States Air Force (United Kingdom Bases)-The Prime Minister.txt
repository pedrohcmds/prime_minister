I think that I have stated that point of view in the sense that we were in the front line, and that is quite true. But the general policy of the late Government in rearming in conjunction with the United States and in making strong defence arrangements has played a noticeable and traceable part in the relaxation and diminution of tension which has occurred. I think that they deserve full credit for their action, in which we supported them, and which is being continued subject to the general tendency of events.
I think that these statements made by responsible ex-Ministers on the Front Opposition Bench are a valuable contribution to our debate.
These matters are, I notice, being seriously touched upon and have been discussed at the Conference now proceeding in Berlin, and possibly there will be a further Conference.
