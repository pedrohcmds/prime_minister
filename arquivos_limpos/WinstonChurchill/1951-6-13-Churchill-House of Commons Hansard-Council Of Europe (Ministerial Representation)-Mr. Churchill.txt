Is it not a fact that this abstention of ministerial representation on the Consultative Committee is only another example of the steady attempt to vitiate the cause of a united  Europe, unless it is a Socialist united Europe which has been pursued by the right hon. Gentleman during the whole of his tenure?
If that difficulty has been faced and overcome by all the other Governments concerned, including some Governments which have Socialist majorities or large Socialist parties, why is it impossible for us to have a similar procedure?
That may raise loud cheers from people who are hard up for cheer. May I ask the Prime Minister whether it does not remain a fact that we were the only one of these Governments who could not solve the problem of ministerial responsibility and representation of independent members upon this body? The position occurred in other countries besides this.
