I am sure that I can speak for the whole House in saying that the announcement of His Majesty's illness has been received with the deepest regret. His Majesty has never spared himself in his unswerving devotion to the heavy and onerous duties of his high office. The twelve years of his reign have been years of strain and anxiety, and His Majesty's steadfast bearing under all the trials of war and peace has done much to keep his people in good heart and courage.
