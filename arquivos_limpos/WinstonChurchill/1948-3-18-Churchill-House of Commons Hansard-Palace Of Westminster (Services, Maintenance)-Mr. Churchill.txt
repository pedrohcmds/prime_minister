May I ask the Minister of Labour a Question of which I have given him Private Notice, after ascertaining which was the Department to which I should put the Question? It is: Whether His Majesty's Government will assume to the full their responsibilities for maintaining the normal services of the House of Commons, and, indeed, of Parliament, in a condition of efficiency, and what steps they propose to take for this purpose?
The right hon. Gentleman has given a very interesting answer to the House upon the merits of the dispute. I gather from him that all the recognised machinery of trade union negotiation was in full operation, and that this was a breakaway unofficial strike, but the Question I really addressed to the right hon. Gentleman dealt rather with the responsibility of the Government for maintaining the services of the House. It is not suitable that the House of Commons and the House of Lords, where the affairs of the whole country have to be dealt with, should be deprived of what are considered to be the regular normal services of this House, and I should like to know what steps the Government propose to take to make sure that these services are resumed at the earliest moment.
I need scarcely say that we wish the right hon. Gentleman to have every opportunity of settling this  matter in the best possible way, but can we have a guarantee that the normal services of this House will be restored by Monday at the latest?
With very great respect, Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of Order. I was not quite clear on the reasons which you gave for not allowing any more questions on the subject. Was it because you did not wish any questions to be asked which might prejudice the chance of a settlement, and, if so, and with great respect, is not that rather a matter of merit than one of Order?
