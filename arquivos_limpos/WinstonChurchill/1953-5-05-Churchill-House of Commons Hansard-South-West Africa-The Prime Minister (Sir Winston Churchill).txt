Discussions with the Commonwealth Prime Ministers are, in accordance with well recognised custom, confidential. I am not prepared to commit myself on what particular subject I may or may not discuss with my fellow Commonwealth Prime Ministers during their visit. It is, however, well recognised that at Commonwealth meetings we do not intervene in matters which are primarily the concern of one individual country. Nevertheless, it is not possible to argue that South-West Africa is simply a matter of domestic concern to the Union Government. This Government and their predecessors have accepted an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice formally recognising that the United Nations have a direct and legitimate concern in the destiny of this former mandated territory. I do not think I want to say anything more upon the subject, and I do not commit myself at all in any way to any discussions which may or may not be raised.
