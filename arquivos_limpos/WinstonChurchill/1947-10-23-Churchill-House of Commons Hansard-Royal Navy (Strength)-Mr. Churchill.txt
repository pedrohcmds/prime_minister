What is the actual strength of the Home Fleet at the present time? Is it true, as was stated in an announcement by the B.B.C. before the week-end, and consequently repeated to the Press of the world, that the Home Fleet consists of only one cruiser and four destroyers at the present time? That is the first question I would venture to ask. The right hon. Gentleman, as a result of the statement he has made, has thrown very little light on the position.
On what authority was this statement made by the B.B.C.? On whose authority was it stated that the Home Fleet would be reduced to what is called a "striking force" of one cruiser and four battle destroyers—not battleships? On whose authority was this statement, so likely to be injurious to our interests all over the world, put up?
I should like to ask the Minister of Defence why this unauthorised report was not in the first place immediately corrected, because great harm was done to our interests all over the world by the idea that we had only one cruiser and four destroyers maintained in our Home Fleet. I should also like to ask how it is, if this is to be the case for the time being, with over 170,000 men at present, and working on the basis of 140,000 men on Vote A right up to the end of the next financial year, which appears in the statement the right hon. Gentleman has just made, and with an expenditure of £180 million, or something like that, he is not able to maintain in commission a proper squadron of ships, with battleships and so forth, during this period? Is the failure of the Government to do that not a proof  of the gross mismanagement and incompetence which has characterised the control of the Fighting Forces since the war, and, I am sorry to say, afflicted the right hon. Gentleman's administration.
Will the right hon. Gentleman be willing to give us a White Paper showing the ships that are to be maintained in commission in the next three or six months, and the scale of complement for these ships? It is not necessary to have wartime complements in time of peace. Will he agree to issue a White Paper on this point, if I put down a Question specifying the headings?
Is this not a novel and new precedent in time of peace? Since when have we not had a full statement, even in times more immediately dangerous than this, of the ships in commission of the Royal Navy—in the different stages of commission, first, second or third scale?
