I can only repeat the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State on 7th February. No decision has yet been taken on the composition of the British Delegation to the Council of Europe. The Permanent Commission of the Brussels Treaty have not yet completed their examination of detailed plans. When they have done so a Governmental Conference will have to be convened at which it is hoped that other European countries besides the Brussels Treaty Powers will assist in the framing of a constitution for the Council of Europe. Recommendations of this Conference will be referred back to Governments, and His Majesty's Government will only then be in a position to report to the House. The right hon. Gentleman will, I hope, understand that I cannot make a statement now about decisions which can only be taken at a later stage.
