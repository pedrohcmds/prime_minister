I cannot feel that the appointment of an additional Under-Secretary to the Ministry of War Transport would be justified. I understand that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has been absent from the House for a short time through illness, but he is now fully restored. Every effort should be made to keep Ministerial offices at a minimum especially in times like these when the ordinary checks are not fully operative.
