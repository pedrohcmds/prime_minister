rose—
Perhaps I might ask the indulgence of the House to reply to the point made by the right hon. Member for Lewisham, South (Mr. H. Morrison). Of course, an Opposition puts down an Amendment with a number of criticisms, and it is undoubtedly open to the Opposition to complain if any one of those criticisms, or of the points raised for discussion, is not fully or properly or timeously dealt with. That is perfectly right, and everyone must judge for himself when it comes to going into the Division Lobbies. [Interruption.] Do try to begin to have a little courtesy. I say, quite frankly, that I have hardly ever seen this sort of thing before.
While the right hon. Gentleman is in this conciliatory mood, may I suggest that he uses some of his influence with his supporters, to see that my right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary at least gets a reasonably uninterrupted hearing—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—on the complicated topics with which he has to deal?
