This is of course a most important change that you have made— [HON. MEMBERS: "It is not a change."] May I ask what was the authority and the basis on which we have worked since this Parliament stood? What was the authority on which it stood?
Did not it stand on your authority?
If your Ruling alters the arrangements which existed since this Parliament began, was not that Ruling a new step on your part?
In what way, Sir, has there been an abuse of Standing Orders, an avoidance of Standing Orders? In what way has there been that since the House met; and why should this matter suddenly be altered when you had not come in and given any Ruling in the first instance, and you come in and give a special Ruling now without our having any opportunity—[Interruption.]
May I, Sir, with very great respect, ask who asked you to give this new Ruling?
With very great respect to you, Sir, and fully recognising all the difficulties with which you have to contend, is it not a very serious thing to change the fundamental basis on which our Standing Committees have been conducted for more than a year in the present Parliament, and to change it at one stroke without the House being apprised of the issues involved in any way or being given any opportunity of expressing an opinion? May I ask whether the only step necessary to bring about this change and procure a new Ruling from you was that the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Committee made a representation to you? Was that the only basis? Is that so, Sir? Did they both make the representation to you?
With great respect, Sir. This is not a question of advice, but of a Ruling. The entire basis of our discus-  sions in Standing Committees has now been changed—changed by altering one figure to the advantage of the Government. That is a very formidable and serious step to have taken. It is an event to which I have not seen a parallel in 50 years' Parliamentary experience.
