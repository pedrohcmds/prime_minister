No, Sir. I have already made a statement on this subject, with other Members of the Government, and we have made our position perfectly clear. There is no intention of reconsidering our position.
I should be very glad to assist my hon. Friend in making some selections from the Ministerial declarations on this subject which he can use in reply to the people who approach him.
I think it would be very disastrous if so far reaching a scheme were to be carried through in an atmosphere which appears to show intolerence to the careful examination of details.
