May I ask the Leader of the House to state the Business of the House for the first week after the Recess?
The right hon. Gentleman has announced a very long list of Bills for the short Sitting on Friday. I hope he does not suppose that any kind of guarantee can be given that it will be possible to deal with all those topics on a Friday. The Inshore Fishing Industry Bill, for instance, which is not a party Measure at all, like most of the others, will arouse a good deal of interest among people connected with the fishing industry. Perhaps I may be permitted to make it clear that we cannot accept any responsibility for the discharge on Friday of all that quantity of Business.
Could we also know when the text of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill will be before us?
