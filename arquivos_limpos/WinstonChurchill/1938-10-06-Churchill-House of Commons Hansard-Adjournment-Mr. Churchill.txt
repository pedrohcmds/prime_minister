May I add my plea to the Prime Minister that he will consider the very reasonable request of the Leader of the Liberal party that we should go away for ten days and meet on the 18th for a day or two? After all, we are passing through a period of very rapid daily change in Europe of the most disturbing character, and it does not seem quite right that Parliament should go away for 25 days as if nothing was going on and as if it had lost interest in matters which affect the whole future of this country. It is derogatory to Parliament, it seems to me, that it should be thought unfit as it were to be attending to these grave matters, that it should be sent away upon a holiday in one of the most formidable periods through which we have lived. I know that there is a certain under-current of derision of Parliament even among its own Members, and a feeling no doubt among Ministers "What relief it will be when we have got them sent about their business and we can get on with our work." That is exactly the idea which in other countries has led to the institution of dictatorships, the same process of impatience with the parliamentary machine which has swept it away and has led to its replacement by one-man rule.
But only on the advice of His Majesty's Government.
Will my right hon. Friend kindly explain why the perfectly innocent question that I put to him, whether it was only on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers that Parliament could  be summoned, should receive from him the wholly inappropriate expression of "unworthy"?
