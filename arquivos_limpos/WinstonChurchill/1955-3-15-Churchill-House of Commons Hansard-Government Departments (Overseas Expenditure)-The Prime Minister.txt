Yes, Sir, we have debates in the House of Commons and  the Select Committees appointed by the House of Commons have their duty to make reports, but continued disputations between the Government and Select Committees do not at present form a prominent part of our procedure.
It is the Government's policy to keep Departmental expenditure overseas to the lowest level, consistent with the United Kingdom military and other commitments. Such expenditure is therefore under continuous review and no special measures are contemplated, beyond those which have long been customary and valued under our present system.
:We should all like to do so, and a very searching inquiry and examination has been made as a result of the Report of the Committee. No doubt the interest which the hon. Gentleman is taking in the matter will contribute to the zeal with which it is being pursued.
I could not do that on the spur of the moment.
