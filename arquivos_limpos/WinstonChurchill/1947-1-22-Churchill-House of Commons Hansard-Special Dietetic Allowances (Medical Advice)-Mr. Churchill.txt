Is there any reason to believe that doctors have been abusing the right of giving advice as to extra diet to their patients in the past few years, and has this abuse amounted to such dimensions as to make an appreciable effect upon the general problem of food supplies?
The right hon. Gentleman the Minister has read out a long and impressive list of all these great authorities whose high standing is supposed to flatten out all criticism of their work, but has he not taken the opportunity, when examining all their credentials and qualifications, to find out how often they meet and how long it takes them to get a borderline case dealt with? Is he now sure, as we all recognise the intelligence which he is giving to his task, that this impressive apparatus at the top is effectively dealing with the many urgent matters which arise in practical instances in ordinary life?
I presume, nevertheless, that the right hon. Gentleman will give us the exact dates of the meetings of the Committee in the last year or 18 months.
Yes, but might not the process be conducted in reverse, namely, that if a medical man, a doctor attending a patient, certifies that the matter is urgent, the diet should be given, within the approved limits, pending reconsideration by higher authority?
The right hon. Gentleman has not really dealt with the point. The point is that a doctor attending a patient should have the responsibility of saying that special patients shall be allowed to have the extra rations until the matter is dealt with by the higher authority.
