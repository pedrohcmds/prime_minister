Is not the Prime Minister introducing an entirely new practice into this House in suggesting that, because there is to be a future debate, Ministers should be excused from answering Questions? In my experience there have always been numbers of Questions put to Ministers in anticipation of bringing out the points to be raised in debate. Surely it would be a bad thing for someone to say that because we have a debate on, say, the Army Estimates a fortnight hence, he will not answer any Questions?
