I had proposed to ask the Prime Minister the following Question: Whether he can give an assurance that no steps will be taken to bring the steel nationalisation Act into operation while the present crisis lasts or until there has been a fresh appeal to the country? But I now understand that the Government wish themselves to volunteer a statement.
When is the Minister of Supply going to make the statement?
The very grave statement to which we have just listened from the Minister of Supply will make it necessary for us to place a Motion on the Order Paper tonight regretting that at this most critical period in our national safety and affairs abroad we should be, by this act of the Government, plunged into the fiercest party controversy at home. We shall therefore place a Motion on the Order Paper tonight, and I ask the Leader of the House whether he will assign Tuesday for its discussion?
Does the Prime Minister attach no importance to the fact that nearly two million of the electors recorded their votes at the last Election against this Measureâ€”a majority of two million?
I must say that I must express my very great regret to the Prime Minister that, with all the responsibilities that rest upon him he should have done this reckless, wanton and partisan act.
