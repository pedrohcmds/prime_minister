The right hon. Gentlemen has omitted to reply to that part of the Question which refers to the sale of Centurion tanks to countries "outside the British Commonwealth."
Surely what is asked in the Question is what has been the export of them in the past. That is the point.
When the right hon. Gentleman says that it is contrary to normal practice, I suppose that normal  practice is subject to the view taken of normal practice by the House?
