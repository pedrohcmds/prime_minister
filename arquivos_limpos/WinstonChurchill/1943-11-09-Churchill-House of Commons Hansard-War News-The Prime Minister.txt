We have arrived at a stage in the war where there are very large free Presses on both sides of the Atlantic which are fed on very full and vivid information from all the theatres of war. It is quite possible that some temporary discordance may from time to time make itself manifest, but I am not aware that there is any great evil here to be grappled with.
I do not quite see what that has to do with the Question on the Paper, but Hitler still has some other allies besides the one mentioned by my hon. and gallant Friend, on which no doubt he relies a great deal.
