Yes, Sir. No one would be more content than myself to see the whole story unfolded. I  pressed this matter several times since the war, during the period when previous Governments were in power. But I do not think at this particular moment I could add anything to what I have said in my answer.
No, Sir. A great deal of it belongs to history, but I think that in publishing history or historical facts consideration should always be given to the views and wishes of those with whom we are working in close friendship.
Yes, Sir, I think that is perfectly true, and some day the full history of the British contribution to those formidable and terrible events, which is a great one, will be made public. It is quite true we could not make the bomb over here during the war because we were under bombardment, but we made a great contribution and I do not think full consideration has been given to that.
