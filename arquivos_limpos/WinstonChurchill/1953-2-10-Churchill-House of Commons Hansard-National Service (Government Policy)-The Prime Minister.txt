The future policy on National Service will be dealt with on the White Paper on Defence which it is hoped will be published next week. Thereafter there will be a defence debate in which the whole matter can be raised.
I thought that the right hon. Gentleman would like to be reassured upon that subject. I said that there will be no change, and that no reduction in the period of National Service can be contemplated at the present time.
I cannot think of anything that would be more disastrous for us than at this moment to reduce the two years' period of National Service. I am sure it would spread despondency throughout free Europe and would make even more difficult than they are many of our relations with the United States.
No, Sir. If it be true, as we all earnestly hope, that the danger of a third world war has receded—and that is a matter which no one can declare with certitude—it is largely due to the exertions made by this country, by the United States and by our allies in Europe to place ourselves in a position of defence; and if at what may be a critical and delicate moment in world history we were suddenly to make a pull-back of this kind, it might do harm far outside anything we can think of.
