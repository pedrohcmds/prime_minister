While not in any way disputing your Ruling, Sir, I should like to ask the Leader of the House whether he can give an assurance that before this matter is carried to a definite conclusion the House will have an opportunity of discussing the question in its general terms. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he is not aware that although the treaty-making power of the Crown is in no way challenged, nevertheless it is customary for the Government of the day, as far as possible, to carry with them the opinion of Parliament, upon whose judgment they depend?
Perhaps I might put a Private Notice Question to the right hon. Gentleman tomorrow?
