I am not aware that any Opposition has been over-vexatious in these matters before. I was in this House on the previous occasions to which reference has been made, and I can well remember the incidents of 1922 and 1924. On those occasions I think it was done with the full acceptance of the House. I cannot see any reason for making, an exception in this case.
I might ask the right hon. Gentleman what is the unusual reason for delay. If I may say so, the right hon. Gentleman is the person who is creating a precedent in this matter. We are acting strictly in accordance with previous precedents.
