There are just under 5,000 boys under 18 years of age serving at sea, of whom 137 have been casualties. The Navy is a voluntary service and secures a large part of its personnel by the recruitment of continuous service boys between the ages of 15 and 16Â½. The consent of their parents is obtained before entry. Training at sea is an essential part of a boy's training, and the great majority of these boys go to sea from the age of 17 upwards. There they perform the task appropriate to their age and training and form an essential part of the ship's company. It is not proposed to alter a system which has been the traditional method of providing personnel for the Navy. In future, however, the consent of the parents will be obtained if, in an exceptional case, the boy's training at sea will start below the age of 17.
I have considered the matter very carefully. As I say, we have 5,000 boys who are an essential part of the complement of the Fleet at the moment. By making the proposal that, before the age of 17, boys may be prevented from going to sea if their parents so desire, I am making a new departure which adds to some extent to the burdens of manning.
