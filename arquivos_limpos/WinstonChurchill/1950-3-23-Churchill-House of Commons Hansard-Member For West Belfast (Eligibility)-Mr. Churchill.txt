When will the Lord President be able to place on the Order Paper the terms of the Motion appointing the Select Committee?
It was the terms of the Motion that I was asking about. Has the Lord President not been considering this in the number of days on which it has been discussed? Is he taken by surprise when, having been asked a Question and answered that he will set up a Select Committee, he is asked the terms of reference of the Select Committee? One would have thought that those two processes would have been gone through in his mind at the same time. [Laughter.] Do not be so insolent over there. You are only half the House remember.
Is the Lord President not aware that the Conservative Party do not have the minute control over the selection of candidates which is practised on the benches opposite?
Might it not be that the hon. Gentleman who is not with us, refrained from taking his seat out of deference to the laws and customs of the House of Commons?
