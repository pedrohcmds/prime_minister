My statement was that before a decision on Bretton Woods is taken, the House will have an oppor-  tunity for full discussion and debate. And it is proposed that there should be a two-day' Debate on this matter. I think that is fully honouring the pledge.
My hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) will be able to make that point, but I do not accept his premises.
I am afraid the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) has not got it right. There is no question of legislation on the commercial agreement. The commercial agreement is a point which is going to be discussed at an international conference, and the matter is intimately bound up  with other matters. All that is suggested is, not a unilateral abandonment of preferences, but discussions for a general reduction of trade barriers in which the reduction of preferences might form a part. No legislation is required on that.
The answer is, "No." I think perhaps hon. Members would find it convenient if they would study the documents obtainable at the Vote Office. They will find answers to-these questions in those documents.
No, Sir. The fact that certain people hold certain opinions does not necessarily mean that, therefore, we should take the Whips off.
I think hon. Members will realise that at this hour it is difficult to go into detailed questions. There will be full opportunity of doing it when the Members have read the White Papers. I think it is inadvisable to go into these things now.
I have already replied to that point. Our practice in this House is that the Government should take responsibility for the Measures which they bring forward.
Yes, Sir, the Bretton Woods Agreement is part of the whole Agreement.
I think hon. Members had better read the whole thing. I know that certain hon. Members have an almost religious fervour on this point.
I quite agree, and I do not grudge it to the hon. Member, but I think it would be better if hon. Members would look at this thing as a whole, and study this document. There will be plenty of opportunities for my hon. Friends below the Gangway to vent all their wrath when they really know what they are talking about.
I am afraid I have exhausted my right to speak.
On that point of Order. I regret to say I have spoken since the Adjournment was moved again. I can speak again only by leave of the House. The short answer to the question which has been put is that under the terms of the Bretton Woods Agreement, becoming an original Member of the Bretton Woods undertaking is dependent on the matter being passed by legislation before 31st December.
