(by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has any further statement to make regarding the situation in Austria?
Can the right hon. Gentleman make more clear the reply which he gave to a question on this subject yesterday, relative to the attitude of His Majesty's Government to the integrity and independence of Austria, as based on the Declaration of 1934?
In view of the methods which have been apparently employed with regard to Austria, can the right hon. Gentleman state the attitude of His Majesty's Government with regard to the position of Czechoslovakia?
