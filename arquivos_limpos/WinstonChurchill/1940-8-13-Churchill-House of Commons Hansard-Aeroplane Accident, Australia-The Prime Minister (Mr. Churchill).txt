We have all been shocked and grieved by the news of the lamentable and untimely loss which the Commonwealth of Australia and, indeed, of the whole Empire and its cause, has suffered in the deaths, like soldiers on duty, of the group of eminent Australian Ministers and high officers in the aeroplane accident of which we have this morning received the news. The sudden removal of these able and resolute men from the centre and summit of war direction in Australia inflicts an injury upon us all which I can be at no pains to conceal. In Brigadier Street and Mr. Fairbairn, in Sir Henry Gullett and Lieut.-General Sir Brudenell White, Australia has been robbed of some of her best and ablest sons at a moment when the gifts they had to offer were most precious. The House will wish to extend its sympathy to their families and friends, and to the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, whose burden is already heavy enough.  In so doing, we shall give voice to the sorrow which in so many lands will be felt by all to whom the cause of freedom is dear. In this hour of battle there will be one other thought, equally spontaneous and equally widespread—Close the ranks, and carry on.
