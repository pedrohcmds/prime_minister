May I first say in reply to those three questions that it is all agreed, I think, that we should have a full debate on this subject? The extent and the timing of it would perhaps be best discussed through the usual channels. It is our desire to meet the House. In regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe (Mr. J. Hynd), I cannot give the details in a statement like this. I think it would be much better to await the debate. I cannot make a full statement on those matters now.
That again is a detailed matter which might be raised later. There might be exceptional cases of older men, certainly for certain sedentary occupations, but broadly speaking one does not expect having to exceed a reasonable age limit.
The hon. Member will know that we have consistently been trying to get those reductions. He will also know, because the figures have been given, of the immense forces built up by another country. Reduction should begin there.
A good deal of overtime is already being worked. That is obviously a matter which should be worked out in industry.
My hon. Friend is inaccurate in that. What I said at that time was that that was the most we could manage without taking special measures. We are now taking those special measures.
I cannot make an absolute statement. Broadly speaking we shall try to get the people on the basis of those who last served to be called. If we are doing so on the basis, as we must, of getting the men who are required for the tasks, it may be that there are key men in certain places who will be required, and who have actually served.
I really cannot let that statement go, because it does harm. The hon. Member knows quite well the fact of the deployment of our troops in various parts of the world who have been holding the line in many places for many years.
We shall try to notify them as soon as possible. We shall try to give reservists as long notice as possible.
We have naturally consulted with our advisers, and we think that under proper arrangements—it is of course absolutely essential when men are called up that they should be properly and fully employed—at least a fortnight is adequate.
I should like to look into that particular point.
The hon. Member will recall that that is one of the matters which I discussed when I was at Washington, and not only the allocation of raw materials, but also the searching out in order to increase the supply. If I may refer to the previous question, I think that was covered by what I said about  reservists who would be retained for essential work.
I think that the hon. Member must look a little more closely into this. Apart from what is called the armaments industry, rearmament does cover an immense range of industries—sub-contracting and so on, the engineering industry and the rest. From the point of view of practical politics it is out of the question to nationalise the whole or every part of industry engaged in rearmament.
That will be dealt with later on in detail.
These detailed matters are rather difficult to deal with by question and answer, because there are various types of reservists. I think it would be better if we left some of these things for the debate.
The hon. Member will realise that there is a limit to the amount of information we wish to give to the world in general on these matters.
I should like my hon. Friend to realise the nature of the problem with which we are faced. It is not just the question of getting so many individuals; it is getting people who have had the training, and who fit in, and therefore make a complete unit. A general appeal for recruits would not do that; therefore there is need for this selective call-up. I need hardly say that it is open for volunteers of the Territorial Army, the Regular Army and the other forces to come forward. The more people who volunteer the better, and the less recourse we shall have to the call-up.
