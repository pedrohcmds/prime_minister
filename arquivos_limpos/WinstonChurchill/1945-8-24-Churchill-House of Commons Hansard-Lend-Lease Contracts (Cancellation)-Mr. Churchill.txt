The very grave and disquieting statement which the Prime Minister has just made to us must overshadow our minds. I agree with him entirely that a Debate of a discursive character arising before these issues have been properly weighed by the House might easily be detrimental to our national interest, which always must claim the allegiance of Members wherever they sit, and I think I can give my assurance on behalf of the hon. Gentlemen who are associated with me on this side of the House that we shall not touch upon this matter in the forthcoming Debate on the Adjournment. Words or phrases might be used which would hamper the task of our negotiators in the difficult matters which lie before them. I think the utmost restraint should be practised, not only in the House, but, if I may say so, also out of doors, in all comments on the American situation at the present time. I cannot believe that it is the last word of the United States; I cannot believe that so great a nation whose  Lend-Lease policy was characterised by me as "the most unsordid act in the history of the world," would proceed in a rough and harsh manner to hamper a faithful Ally, the Ally who held the fort while their own American armaments were preparing.
I think we might have no interruption from the hon. Gentleman who seats himself in such an unsuitable position. I say that I hope indeed that this very great burden and strain will be eased as a result of the discussions which are proceeding, and I give my support to the Prime Minister in the request he has made to the House.
