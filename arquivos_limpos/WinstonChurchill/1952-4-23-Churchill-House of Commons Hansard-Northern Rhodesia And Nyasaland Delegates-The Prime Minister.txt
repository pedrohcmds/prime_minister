These are matters of great importance and, quite apart from that, there is great interest in the House upon them. I am sure that Her Majesty's  Government will always do their best, subject to the demands of public business, to afford opportunities to debate these large issues. I suggest that there are opportunities open to the Opposition on Supply days, and there are other opportunities which readily occur to me but, in any case, we have no desire to prevent these matters from being discussed. On the contrary. Might they not be the subject of discussion through the usual channels to find an opportunity? The House should always be helped to talk about the things it wants to discuss, but there must be reasonable opportunity. Why not let it be discussed in the ordinary manner?
