Offers of assistance have been received not only from the institutes referred to in the hon. Member's Question but from the representatives of science generally. His Majesty's Government welcome the contribution which science is making to the war effort. In reply to the second part of the Question, I would remind the hon. Member that on the advice of my right hon. Friend the late Lord President of the Council, who had been in consultation with the Royal Society, I have already approved the setting-up of a Scientific Advisory Council under the chairmanship of my noble Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the constitution and terms of reference of which have been announced in the public Press.
