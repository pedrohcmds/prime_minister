May I express to the Prime Minister our thanks for the very full and careful statement that he has made and for his lengthy, though not apparently particularly accurate, researches into the precedents of 45 years ago. We express our obligation to him for having taken so much trouble on a matter raised by the Opposition, and I should like also to congratulate him upon the great joy and relief which his remarks have given to the party behind him.
