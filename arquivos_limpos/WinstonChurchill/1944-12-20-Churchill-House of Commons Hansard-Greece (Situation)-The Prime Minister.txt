That is a topic with which, obviously, I should not attempt to deal now.
There is complete co-operation, but whether there is complete agreement on every aspect of this matter is another question altogether. I have not the slightest doubt that effective co-operation will go on, in all aspects of the war. We had a certain task thrown upon us, and we are discharging it to the best of our ability.
I think it would certainly be a justifiable conclusion to form at this stage.
This Question was to have been answered by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, together with Question No. 9 in the name of the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Riley).
It was arranged that my right hon. Friend should answer the Question. I now gather that the hon. Gentleman who put it down was unfortunately not in his place, and I had not prepared myself to answer that Question.
I would like to see what I am reading out lest I should make a mistake.
On a point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Would it be in Order for my right hon. Friend to answer in my place?
