I invited Sir James Lithgow to undertake the task of securing us the maximum output of merchant shipbuilding, which is clearly a matter affecting our life and success in war. I am sure that this is the best arrangement that could be made, as in addition to his far-reaching connections with every aspect of merchant shipbuilding, he filled a place in this same Department during the late war with conspicuous success. I proposed that he should receive a salary equal to that of the Controller of the Navy, but he has wished to give his services without remuneration. He has also resigned his position upon the Board of National Shipbuilders' Security, Limited, and has obtained leave of absence, with two exceptions, from the boards of all other companies of which he is either chairman or director.
I presume that he will have to live on his savings, like quite a number of people do.
