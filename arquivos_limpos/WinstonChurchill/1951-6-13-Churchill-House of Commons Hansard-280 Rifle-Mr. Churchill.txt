Is it not a fact that to re-equip the British Army with the.280 will take a matter of 10 years or so? During all that time we shall have cut ourselves out of the opportunity of adopting a weapon which is being adopted by  the United States and Canada, essential to any good system of defence, and besides that we have the great disadvantage not only of being isolated but of having a dual armament in our own forces.
I am very glad to have the assurance that the jigs and gauges by which the.303 is made are not to be taken away and dispersed and that the mass production of the.303 to keep our Army properly equipped is to be provided. If I could have that assurance it would greatly affect my point of view. Can the right hon. Gentleman give us that assurance?
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider in his study of this matter of the best that, while it is no doubt right to have the best weapons, the best includes also those which enable us to work with other members of the Commonwealth and with other countries with whom we are allied, as well as actual improvement in the rapidity of fire, etcetera?
I am glad to hear that it will be discussed at the Commonwealth Conference, but are we to understand that this is not a decision of the British Government that is a foregone conclusion, and that they will be influenced by the discussions that take place there?

Are we to go on producing the necessary numbers of our own existing pattern, and, at this time of great pressure in re-armament, to make a great effort to produce this entirely new and isolated type of weapon?
