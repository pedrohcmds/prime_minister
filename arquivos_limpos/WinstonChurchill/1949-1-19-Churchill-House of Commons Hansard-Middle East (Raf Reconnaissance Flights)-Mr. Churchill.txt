Have the Egyptian Government invoked the Treaty or have they not?
What is this doctrine of the "appropriate Ministers"? Decisions of this character surely have to be given through some specific Department whose Minister is directly responsible. Is that not so? What is the "appropriate Minister"? Yet the right hon. and learned Gentleman, when tackled in the House on the subject, seems to suggest that others intervened upon him and gave him directions which he carried out.
Is it a fact, then, that the instructions were given to the right hon. and learned Gentleman from the Foreign Office?
No, no; I asked a precise question. The right hon. and learned Gentleman says he acted upon certain instructions and used his authority, quite properly, under those instructions. Did those instructions come from the Foreign Office?
Then we understand they came from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs himself?
The right hon. and learned Gentleman told us that one of the Ministers who asked him or instructed him to undertake these reconnaissances was the Foreign Secretary. Which other Minister, except the Prime Minister, has an equal responsibility for deciding upon these particular matters? Which other Minister? I think the Prime Minister might say something on this.
Would it not be in accordance with the general convenience of the House not to have a Debate on this extremely difficult and serious subject in so short a time as that permitted?
