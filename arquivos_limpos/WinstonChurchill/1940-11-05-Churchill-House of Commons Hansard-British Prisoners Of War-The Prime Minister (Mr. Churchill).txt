His Majesty's Government have had this whole matter under review. Responsibility for the despatch of parcels to British prisoners of war has, by arrangement with the Government, been undertaken by the war organisation of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John. The influence and usefulness of the Society are largely due to its independence of Government control, and its relationship with the International Red Cross at Geneva rests on that basis. In these circumstances to appoint a member of the Government to the Council of the Society, as suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend would, in the view of the Government, be likely to defeat the very objects which he has in mind. As regards Questions in this House, various Government Departments have responsibilities in connection with prisoners of war, and I think it is desirable that Parliamentary Questions should be addressed to the Ministers responsible for those Departments. I have, however, arranged that, in order to meet the convenience of the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War will answer any Questions raising general issues relating to prisoners of war which are not specifically the concern of another Service Department.
