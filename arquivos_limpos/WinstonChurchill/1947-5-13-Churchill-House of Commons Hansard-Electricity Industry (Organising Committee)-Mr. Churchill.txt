May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether this Committee, whose names he has read out, to organise the electricity industry will address themselves to the interests of the nation as a whole, or whether they will be told that the only thing is to look after organised labour and not to care a tinker's curse for anyone else?
I quite understand that the right hon. Gentleman feels as though he were up a tree. May I assure him that I do not rely only upon the newspaper Press? I took the trouble to procure the best reports available of certain remarks attributed to him. Of course, if he wishes to explain that he did not use those remarks, no one would be more pleased than I am and no one would be more ready to accept the fact that he disengages himself from the whole business.
I presume we are to await a personal explanation from the right hon. Gentleman—
—that he has been misreported—
Shut up, Moscow.
May I ask whether the right hon. Gentleman will circulate with the Votes the salaries of this important Committee?
I suppose when it is settled we shall be told, but was it not a great pity to move Lord Citrine, for whom I have the greatest respect—I have often worked with him in public matters —from the Coal Board at a time when, after a good many months, he must have been gaining a mastery of the specialised knowledge needed for the successful administration there? Was it not possible to form this Committee without making a serious rent in the Coal Board?
Even the House of Commons might be allowed to form an opinion.
