In reply to the first question, that is answered in the announcement made on 23rd September. The second question I do not think really arises. On the third question, we have already declared our policy. The matter is being discussed in America in the United Nations meeting and we made perfectly clear our policy that we believe there should be international control of atomic energy.
It on reflection it was considered useful, I should certainly be prepared to give that full consideration.
The matter and the attitudes of the various Governments concerned have been fully expressed. Great progress would be made if the Government of Soviet Russia would agree to international inspection.
The question of the atom weapon falls into its place with other considerations but, as I am advised, the fact of the existence of the atom bomb does not necessarily mean that all other weapons are obsolete.
I am not prepared to give a reply of that kind. In this question we are working closely with the United States of America and with Canada. Obviously, the question of what disclosures of information are made must be a matter for consideration between Governments.
I was dealing with the point of inspection.
I think that is an entirely different question. What hours a scientist can effectively work is a matter for consideration.
I am not prepared to give any further information at Late present moment.
Yes, I quite agree, but the whole point is that there are only certain countries where the people can make their voices effective.
