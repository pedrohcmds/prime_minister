No, Sir.
I have, of course, not examined in detail the precedents quoted by the right hon. Gentleman, but neither of them touches the financial question, and therefore the constitutional points which I have put did not arise. There is a definite distinction in the character of the questions. Moreover, if my recollection serves me rightly, no further action was required from the executive Government of the day in consequence of the two votes passed by the House in the cases which the right hon.  Gentleman has mentioned. Events merely rolled upon their course. In this case, definite, responsible, constructive action involving a charge upon the public is called for from the Government.
The Motion which was put down was put down by hon. Members of several parties in Opposition time. We had no power to prevent it. It was the right of Members of all parties to put it down, and personally I was very much in favour of a free vote being given on the subject, but that does not remove the fact that the Government of the day, representing the Crown in the matter, have the constitutional responsibility for any proposal involving a charge upon the public, and an expression of opinion by the House does not relieve them of their responsibility.
I think that it would be better, in the general interest, that the right hon. Gentleman should carry out the course he proposed and consult his friends upon the issue.
There may be divided opinions at that meeting, as there  often are in these discussions, but I think that it would be better that he should discuss the matter with his friends. [HON.MEMBERS: "No."] That is what he said he was going to do, and we shall not settle it by shouting. I think that would be a very great mistake on an issue of this kind. I think that it would be better that he should discuss the matter with his friends, and then give the decision at which he arrives.
The prestige of Parliament is a matter about which I feel always very deep concern; but I am quite sure that special restraint and composure should be imposed upon us all during the discussions which take place.
I earnestly hope that if the proposal of the Government should eventually be accepted—[HON. MEMBERS: "What is it?"]—if the alternative proposal that I mentioned in my statement is accepted by the Opposition—some very definite results will accrue, which will meet the undoubted difficulties which are felt on both sides of the House.
My hon. Friend has no doubt noticed that I inserted the word "forthwith"; I said we were
