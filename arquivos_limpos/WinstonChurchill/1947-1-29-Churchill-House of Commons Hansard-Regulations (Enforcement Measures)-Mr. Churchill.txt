Does the right hon. Gentleman deny that to employ, as a public charge, considerable numbers of persons to try and provoke breaches of, the Regulations by His Majesty's subjects, is a despicable procedure?
Has the right hon. Gentleman any right to apply to wartime processes, when the life of the country was at stake, abuses and extensions of those processes after a year and a half of peace?
May I ask—
Of course we know that the Communists do it always. May I ask whether there are more, and if so how many more, persons employed on this "snooping out," as I believe it is called, than there was before?
Is the right hon. Gentleman able to use the powers which he has inherited from the wartime period to enter a private home in order to ascertain, under the authority only of a Food Regulation, whether a food undertaking is being conducted therein? Do these powers not exceed those wielded by the criminal law under the long built up principles of social life in this country?
Has the right hon. Gentleman power to enter premises with a view to finding out whether the information given by his snoopers is right or wrong?
May I support that plea, and ask that the right hon. Gentleman will give careful consideration to this matter on grounds of general policy? There is a great deal of difference between a factory and a home. Scandals must be probed, and those who defeat public regulations and defy the public interest must eventually be caught. Nevertheless, there are great principles of privacy and right, and will the right hon. Gentleman endeavour to have these matters reconsidered on a high level and regulations made?
