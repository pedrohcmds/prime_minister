(by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs—(i) whether his attention has been called to the publication by the United States Department of State of documents upon Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941, and whether he will arrange that copies of this book shall be available in sufficient numbers in the Library of the House; and (ii) whether he has any intention of making a similar separate British publication as authorised by the Agreement of the British and United States Governments in June, 1946, and subsequently concurred in by the French Government.
May we take it that the consideration will reach a conclusion within a period sufficiently short to enable  us to form an instructed judgment of the many important issues involved?
I take it that the right hon. Gentleman will bear in mind that, owing to the very small quantity of newsprint which it is possible to allow at the present time, no full accounts of these important documents are given to the British public. Will he also bear in mind that Members of Parliament, without distinction of party, have great responsibility in giving their votes and expressing their opinion on all matters connected with foreign affairs, and there are many matters of high importance in this American publication—and I doubt not in the corresponding British publication—which are essential to a correct judgment being formed upon these matters?
Perhaps if I asked the right hon. Gentleman another question in the course of the next few weeks he would be able to give me a more definite answer?
Facts are the foundation of our judgment. The House has great responsibility and ought to have the essential facts. There is no reason why America should have a mass of essential material which is denied to the British House of Commons.
By agreement.
Surely the right hon. Gentleman did not have his attention drawn to this matter first of all when the United States made this publication? He and his Department must have studied and considered the question for a long time previously. It should not be left to the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue in the House of Commons. There is no reason why the initiative in giving the full and necessary information should not have come from the Foreign Secretary himself.
May I add to that, with which I entirely agree, "subject of course to the interest of truth and the House of Commons being properly equipped to discharge its duties"?
rose—
Presumably the right hon. Gentleman is aware that it is very difficult to get this American publication. Only a few copies have been available over here and newspapers have no space to print it. Many things relevant to our debates are contained therein.
