The Leader of the Opposition was good enough to give me notice that he intended to put the question which the House has heard, so I have had a brief opportunity of considering the subject. The conclusion I arrived at is the same as that suggested by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair), that, on the whole, it would be better to leave the matter, as you suggest, Sir, where it is, because it is established, so far as this House is concerned, that a breach of Privilege was committed, and it is established that that breach of Privilege was in the summoning of the hon. Member in the circumstances detailed in the Report of the Committee of Privileges. It does not really make any difference so far as the House is concerned who summoned him; the breach of Privilege has been established, whoever summoned him. As the right hon. Gentleman the Member for  Caithness and Sutherland has reminded us, this matter is still under the consideration of the Select Committee——
Perhaps it was not explicit enough when I said that this was under the consideration of the Select Committee. I did not mean that the question of Privilege was under the Select Committee, but I meant the whole story, and, in particular, the actions of the Ministers concerned. The House has had to spend a good deal of time over this, and it is desirable that we should not give the country the impression that we are spending too much time. If it be the case, as you have suggested, Sir—and I think it is the case—that there is no reflection upon anybody concerned with the summoning, I do not think there is any particular object in sending it back to the Committee of Privileges. I think the House will agree when I say it would be unwise to put down another Motion to rescind the report of the Committee which has already been presented to us and debated by the House. It would mean that the matter would have to be referred to the Committee of Privileges once again.
