Yes, Sir. I hope it may be possible to arrive at an exact synchronisation.
That is not the Question on the Order Paper.
I was consulted on this point before Lord Alexander left and advised him to wear uniform when visiting troops in the battle zone in Korea. As a field marshal, Lord Alexander is permanently on the active list and this procedure was in every way correct.
If that was all I was warned against it does not amount to much. I should have thought that it was very reasonable and proper for the field marshal to wear his uniform when going into the battle zone. Indeed, I think that even from a practical point of view to have one civilian going around amid a mass of military officers might have attracted attention from the enemy air service. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Certainly. In any case, the conduct was perfectly correct in every way. I might here confess to the House another case when the field marshal also wore his uniform at the Trooping the Colour.
