So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the export to China is prohibited, except under licence, of the goods set out in the schedules to the Export of Goods (Control) (Consolidation) Order, 1950, as subsequently amended. It is not generally possible to distinguish in the trade returns between exports which have been licensed and those which do not require a licence. Licences have, however, been issued in the last three months for the export to China of about £6,800 of dyestuffs and about £1,250 of other commodities. Licensing arrangements vary considerably from one British Colonial Territory to another. As far as strategic materials are concerned, the Far Eastern Colonies follow the pattern of United Kingdom controls.
Yes, Sir.
As I understand, there has been a prohibition of all major strategic materials. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, there are points where one cannot say when one might have vague, possible, strategic materials, but so far as we can possibly ensure, no strategic materials have been sent.
I understand none. I think a certain misapprehension arose because of the very broad categories used for our exports not only to  China but to other countries and a broad thing such as "vehicles" and so forth might include bicycles, perambulators and the rest but there were, as a matter of fact, no warships, aircraft or anything of the sort.
Yes. I have pointed out we have stopped export of any strategic goods from here and from Hong Kong.
That is a question that might be put to the President of the Board of Trade.
It might or might not be. We have in fact an absolute prohibition at the present time on rubber.
I could not answer that question without notice.
I did not blame the hon. Member. I only pointed out that he laboured under a certain misapprehension because of the width of the categories on which the Board of Trade terms are based. Iron and steel manufactures include products from normally finished steel to things like wire mattresses, nails, tacks, rivets, manhole covers and a whole range of very minor matters, and I think there was a distinct misapprehension owing to the categories in the reply given.
None whatever.
The matter of economic sanctions is still under consideration by the United Nations. Natural rubber was not included in the prohibited and restricted lists originally owing to the great difficulty of control by export licensing, but in the first months of this year it was restricted by administrative action, and since then there have been stricter limitations. That was done in  agreement with the United States of America and finally, in April, there was complete prohibition.
I have not exact information as to what particular categories came under these vehicles. They include locomotives and ships and a very wide range of things and, as I say, bicycles. I do not know the amount for which the hon. Member asks.
I will certainly do it if it is possible. It means very great examination of all the Customs returns and, remember, it means checking up on licences which were given months ago and which have not been brought forward. There is no intention whatever of excluding from the House any knowledge it ought to have, but I think people ought not to suggest by any manner of means, that what has gone from here has been used against our men, because everybody knows the sources of the Chinese army's supplies.
That is rather a different question. I have endeavoured to give the right hon. Gentleman the fullest answer today.
May I make a correction to a statement I made just now? I think I may have overstated the matter. With regard to the exports of rubber, they have been subject to export licensing since 9th April to prevent undue and enlarged quantities being sent to any particular destination. But there has not been, and cannot be I think, an absolute prohibition to see that no rubber whatever gets to China.
It is a question of degree—how much is strategic. As I understand it, it is a matter which has been done in agreement with the Americans. It is really a question of quantities. Obviously large quantities would amount to strategic supplies, but a very small quantity of rubber for particular purposes would not. I understand that is how it is dealt with under the export licensing.
I am not aware of that. I could not answer that without notice.
That is a question which might be put to the President of the Board of Trade. I will try to give the detailed figures.
Yes, Sir. That is what I am saying. This was done in accord with the United States.
