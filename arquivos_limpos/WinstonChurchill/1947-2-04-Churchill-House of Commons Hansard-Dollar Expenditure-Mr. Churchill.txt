Is it not of the highest importance that the American loan should be used to bring in the appliances to put our industry in the latest condition, and also essential foods, and that all other expenditure should be viewed with severe restraint by the Chancellor of the Exchequer?
The right hon. Gentleman always tries to make a joke by turning a point against a questioner as a personal taunt. May I ask a question which relates entirely to his public duties as Chancellor of the Exchequer, which he sometimes forgets are national duties? Is there any reason to suppose that the British nation would not be willing to submit to any curtailment of non-essentials in regard to imports of films and tobacco out of the American loan in order either that that loan should be expended on essentials or that it should last longer?
What about American films?
