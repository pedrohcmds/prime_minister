We are very glad on this side of the Committee to support the Motion which the Prime Minister has moved. On 6th April my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) asked a Question, no doubt by arrangement through the usual channels, to which an answer was given forecasting the procedure the consequences of which we have now before us. We are therefore entirely in favour of these gifts being made from the mother of Parliaments to the daughter States as they were, sister States as they are—I am not quite sure how these family arrangements are conceived of on the other side of the globe —who carry forward so much of our traditions and life and on whom we rely not only to strengthen us in the years to come but to carry our message on to future ages that we shall not perhaps see, in proportionately as powerful a position as we occupy at the present time.
