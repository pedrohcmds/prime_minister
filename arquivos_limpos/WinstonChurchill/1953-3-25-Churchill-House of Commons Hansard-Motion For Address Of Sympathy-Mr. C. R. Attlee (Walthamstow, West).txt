I rise to support, on behalf of my right hon. and hon. Friends on this side of the House, the Motion which has been moved in such fitting and eloquent terms by the Prime Minister. We share the sorrow which the whole country feels in the loss of Queen Mary, and we express our deep sympathy with Her Majesty the Queen and all the Members of the Royal Family.
