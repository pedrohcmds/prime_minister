My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary would, in the normal practice, lead such a Delegation. The Lord President of the Council would not in ordinary circumstances take the lead of the Foreign Secretary in this matter. The title of Deputy Prime Minister is a courtesy title and one which has no constitutional authority at the present time. I may say that in this Government, while it lasts—I do not know how long it will last; some would like it to last very much longer, and some people like to fish in troubled waters—
—in this Administration, I say Ministers have not been engaged on a meticulous pushing of their personal claims and questions of etiquette. It was discussed with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council and he entirely agreed with the arrangement that was made. He agreed to it because he is not a self-seeking man and always tries to play the game and do the best he can, which is very much to his honour. I shall always assert that—except at times when we have special questions of difference.
I think that whatever happens we ought to keep it going until after the San Francisco Conference.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs holds the Seals of State which make him responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs, and the Lord President of the Council—the capacity in which he has elected to go—is not similarly charged under the Constitution.
There could hardly be a more unfair and, I may say, a more characteristic utterance than that of the  hon. Gentleman. He has done everything in his power to break up this Government. He hopes to gain after its dissolution what he would never gain while national affairs dominated men's minds. Any fair-minded man would say that the Labour Party have had fair representation in this Government.
I am the person responsible for nominating this Delegation, and they have a fair representation in this Delegation. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) said so just now. [Interruption.] People have a right to live even if they do not agree with the hon. Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell). A large proportion, three Labour Members, will be there, and I must say that I think it is a churlish manner to receive an announcement of this kind, in which all my colleagues are in full agreement. I do not mean with all I have said just now, but the statement on the Delegation in which all my colleagues are agreed.
That question will come on immediately on the discussion of Business.
