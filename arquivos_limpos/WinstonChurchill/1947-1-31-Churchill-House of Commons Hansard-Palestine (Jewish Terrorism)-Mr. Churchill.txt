This is a matter on which we wish to be precise. Is it necessary for an appeal to be made to the Privy Council by the person concerned? Is that a necessary and essential step, and was this step taken by the prisoner formally before the sentence was respited?
Could the right hon. Gentleman—this is an important point—give the House an assurance—and we all accept his own personal good faith—that the desire to save the lives of the judge and of Major Collins, played no part in the decision to respite the execution?
But withdrawal of his signature destroyed his appeal; is not that so? It must not be imagined that I am pleading for a bloodthirsty cause. On the contrary, I am endeavouring to follow out a principle.
