Does not the point which the right hon. Gentleman has made there imply that the Government will not change because, if there is any thought of their changing, the military and people  abroad would be in a state of uncertainty? The implication of the right hon. Gentleman's speech, therefore, is that two years will remain without any change.
If the hon. and gallant Gentleman is referring to me, I reply that I said quite the other thing.
Was he not referring to the reason why we had general National Service, and not just to the two years? He was saying that the purpose for which we had National Service had been achieved.
May I correct the right hon. Gentleman, because I think he has quite misunderstood the Motion? The Motion does not say that the time has now arrived for a reduction; it says that the time has now arrived when the matter should be reviewed annually.
