In my reply last Thursday to my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster (Sir J. Wardlaw-Milne), referring to the memorandum from the Select Committee on National Expenditure, I was, of course, dealing only with the action taken by the Government upon a particular memorandum submitted to me. I think that this must have been quite clear to most hon. Members, but lest there should be any misapprehension in the mind of anyone, I wish to make it quite clear that I had no thought in my own mind of laying down any new procedure for the Committee or of interfering in any way with the normal powers exercised by-Select Committees of this House for the summoning of witnesses.
