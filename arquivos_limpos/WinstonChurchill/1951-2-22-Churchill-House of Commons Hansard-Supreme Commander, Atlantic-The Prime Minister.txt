Yes, Sir. The North Atlantic Treaty Defence Committee have agreed that there should be a Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and that he should be an American. An American officer has already been nominated for this appointment, and it is expected that an announcement will be made on this matter very shortly.
In an organisation of a number of Powers, as in the North Atlantic Treaty organisation, an appointment is made by those Powers.

All these matters will be properly covered when the details of the appointment are announced.
Of course we had our say.
