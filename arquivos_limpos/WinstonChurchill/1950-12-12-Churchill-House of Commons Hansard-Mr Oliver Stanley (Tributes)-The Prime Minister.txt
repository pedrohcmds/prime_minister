This week the House has lost one of its most distinguished and well-loved Members, Oliver Stanley, and I believe that we should all wish to express our sorrow and our sense of loss. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] We in this House feel that we belong to a community and the bonds of friendship extend beyond the bounds of party, and when death takes any one of our Members we feel the loss and you. Mr. Speaker, express that on behalf of us all. But it is a well recognised practice that when Members who have held high positions in this House die, an opportunity should be given for tribute to be paid.
