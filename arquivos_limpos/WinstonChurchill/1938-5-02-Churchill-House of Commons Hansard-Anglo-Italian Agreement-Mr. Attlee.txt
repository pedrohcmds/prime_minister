What does the right hon. Gentleman mean by a settlement?
The right hon. Gentleman is asking the House to approve a Treaty that is to come into force on the specific terms that there should be a settlement in Spain, and now he says that he cannot tell the House what a settlement is. It is ridiculous. The House is entitled to know.
We have placed on the Paper an Amendment to the Prime Minister's Motion in which we set out our reasons for disagreeing with these proposals. The Prime Minister in his speech  —I am sorry he is not present—made his usual sneer at the Opposition. That is becoming habitual with him now. He said that it was not worth while taking any notice of the terms in which this Amendment was put down. He followed it up by indulging in ostentatious conversation all the time that my right hon. Friend the Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison) was talking.
We are getting rather accustomed to that kind of thing now. If the Prime Minister had been here I was going to point out to him that that kind of treatment of the Opposition is not a sign of strength. It is a sign of weakness. Mere bad manners does not mean strength. There was a very obvious reason why the Prime Minister did not deal with this Amendment. It was because he could not controvert its terms. It opens by stating clearly something which is the subject of constant misrepresentation by Ministers of the Crown and Government supporters. It states: 
The Prime Minister chooses in this connection to use the names of Mazzini and Garibaldi. I think he might spare their memory. If he knows anything about Mazzini and Garibaldi he will know that they would not have approved of the Fascist regime. Does he suppose that Mazzini and Garibaldi would have joined in helping to destroy a friendly republic in Spain? If the Prime Minister knows anything of them he will remember that Garibaldi, in his old age in 1871, turned out again to fight for the French Republic, his fellow-republicans, against Germany, despite all the wrongs done to him by France when they took his birthplace from Italy. If he were alive to-day, Garibaldi would be with the Garibaldi legionaries, the men who made the Black-shirts run at Guadalajara. Garibaldi was well summed up by Mr. George Trevelyan in these words:
