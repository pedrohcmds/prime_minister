If my hon. Friend has an opportunity of visiting Moscow during the war, I think he will see the smartest saluting in the world. The Russians attach great importance to these minor acts of ceremony in the building up of armies which are capable of facing the worst rigours of war.
I hope we should be walking arm in arm.
