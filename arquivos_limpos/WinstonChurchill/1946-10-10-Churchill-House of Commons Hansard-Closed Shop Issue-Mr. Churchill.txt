What is the Government definition of the "closed shop issue"?
The right hon. Gentleman is responsible for dealing with these matters. Has he not formulated in his mind any idea what the closed shop issue is, and if he has, why should not he tell the House?
Is it not a fact that 20 or 30 men have been dismissed by an employer on the orders of a great trade union because they did not belong to the great trade union? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] I am asking, is it not a fact that that is so? Have the Government not even taken the trouble to consider the implications of a step like that? Have they no opinion to give the House except the farrago of confusion, evasion, tricky  words and formulas in which the right hon. Gentleman is indulging?
