I desire, with permission, to make a statement in reply to Question 49.
I am not aware that Mr. Hayter gave expression to anything except general approval of the plan.
The Labour Party document to which the right hon. Gentleman refers is a general statement of party policy, and it sets out, in the section on the problem of the basic industries, what the party considers to be the ultimate necessities of a fully developed scheme of European co-operation in this field. But the Government have always made clear both at the O.E.E.C. and elsewhere that they are fully prepared to co-operate in the closer integration of the European economy with other countries which hold different economic views. The Labour Party document is not, of course, a statement of Government policy in this matter. Government policy is as I have just now stated.
I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman quite caught what I said. I said that a White Paper was being published. It was available at 3.30 this afternoon.
Regarding the last point of the right hon. Gentleman, I would remind him that during the war he was the only Conservative Prime Minister among the Allies and in the British Commonwealth and he was indebted to strong support from the Labour Governments in the Commonwealth. With regard to his first question, perhaps the Lord President of the Council will reply.
I shall fortify myself by the example of the way the right hon. Gentleman stood up to it during the war.
That brings out the difficulty of discussing this plan. There are no details whatever. This is a sketch of a great idea, but it has not  yet been filled out in any detail, and I cannot give an answer to that question.
Full arrangements have already been made for complete liaison in this matter.
I could not quite understand the question of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger).
In a matter of this kind it really is not for us to ask the French Government to put themselves out for the convenience of this House. This House should debate the matter at the right time when they get the information, and in due course we shall get notice from the French Government.
I do not think there was time for any consultation. This is a specific invitation addressed to His Majesty's Government.
If the hon. Member will read the statement I have made in this House, he will see that the attitude of His Majesty's Government is perfectly clear. We accept this as a great idea, but it is quite impossible for us at present to accept it in all its details—or indeed the exact principle—before we know how it will work out in fact.
I entirely agree. The only point we have made is that if it is to be a fruitful discussion, it should be a discussion on definite proposals. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman can see the implications of this scheme or indeed the general framework of the scheme at present. I cannot. I think we should do better when we know more about it. That is the only point. There is no intention whatever of avoiding a Debate. This is a matter of very great importance to this country, to Europe and to the world. If the right hon. Gentleman will consider the matter carefully, I think he will see that a mere Debate in the void on some general question of what we can do on this matter would not take us very far without seeing more in detail what the French Government have in mind.
I understand that the meeting is to take place on the 20th.
If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will read the White Paper, he will see exactly what took place. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman thinks that we should have accepted this position and bound ourselves to agree to something about which we had no details, that is a matter which he might debate; but as I understand the position, the general view expressed in this country is that we should like to see more details before we bind ourselves. It was not the case that we refused to go to a round-table conference. We were perfectly willing. We were not prepared to go to a round-table conference binding ourselves to do certain things which we might have found we were not able to do.
All I say to the right hon. Gentleman is that he is again mistaken about what I said. I never suggested that we should wait until agreed and cut-and-dried proposals have been reached by all the Governments. What I did suggest was that we might see what was the actual scheme put forward. I suggest that if the right hon. Gentleman would read the White Paper first of all, he would see the course of the discussions. My statement today will not add much to what is in the White Paper, which sets out, I think very clearly and in a way which can be understood on both sides, exactly the reasons why we could not go in with our hands bound.
We do not want to embarrass the discussions by putting forward proposals ourselves at this time.
They have been kept fully informed all the time. The general practice in these matters has been stated over and over again. On matters of this kind Commonwealth Governments are kept fully informed. It is up to them, if they wish to make any statements or suggestions, to do so.
It is not pretty well known on the Continent. It happens to be entirely contrary to fact.
Because the French Government asked for a decision by a certain time.
