I think matters had better be treated generally in relation to all the Dominions. But I have noticed various statements.
That is a very large question, and I am not prepared to deal with it now. I think it would be very desirable to have an Imperial Conference to see what could be arranged, but it is not easy to have an Imperial Conference. We must remember that these Dominion Prime Ministers are persons of the highest consequence in their own countries, that they have the highest affairs to settle and legislatures to wait upon constantly. It is not easy for them to find the opportunity, much as they would wish to do so; but if we can get them here in the course of the summer or the autumn these matters can be discussed. Meanwhile, they are not much helped by questions of this sort.
No, Sir; I have seen no official request of that kind.
I am afraid that at times that gentleman was very annoying.
