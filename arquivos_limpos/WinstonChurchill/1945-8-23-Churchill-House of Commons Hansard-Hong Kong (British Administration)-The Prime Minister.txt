Yes, Sir. As stated by the Foreign Secretary on Monday, arrangements are being made for the Japanese surrender in Hong Kong to be accepted by a British Force Commander. Plans for re-establishing British Administration in the Colony are fully prepared.
Yes, Sir. I have a very full recollection of those statements, and I will bear them in mind.
Certainly; I have no doubt that every attention will be given to them. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will put a Question on this particular point to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
