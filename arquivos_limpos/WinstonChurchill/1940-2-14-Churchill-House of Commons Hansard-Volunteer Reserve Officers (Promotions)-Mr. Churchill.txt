The number of former members of the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve who have been promoted to the rank of temporary lieutenant, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, after a period of preliminary training, is about 400. The length of the training course has varied according to the qualifications which the officer already possessed and the appointment for which he was required.
I regret that the information asked for by my hon. Friend in the first part of his Question is not available. Certain temporary officers are already serving in the rank of lieutenant-commander where their duties merit this rank, and such promotions will continue to be made in suitable cases.
Yes, Sir. That problem is not confined to this class of officers or to the Admiralty, but certainly those, and other, aspects have to be taken into account in connection with promotions which are made in the emergency of war.
