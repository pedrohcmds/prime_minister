An answer to this Question would depend on an accurate assessment of a variety of immeasurables. I am advised that from our present knowledge the number of major experimental explosions required to produce lethal risks over an area beyond that immediately affected by the explosion would be very large indeed. On the most cautious assumptions it would be, so I am advised, considerably greater than the number which could conceivably be employed in any tests likely to be made by the Powers who possess these weapons. Investigation into this problem is proceeding actively and continuously.
