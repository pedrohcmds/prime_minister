My right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a visit to Washington recently for the very purpose set out in my hon. Friend's Question, and the new United States Administration have undertaken an urgent review of their whole external economic policy. I should deprecate unduly sanguine expectations that four or five days of discussion at Bermuda will achieve solutions of all our problems. The triple Conference was proposed by President Eisenhower, and I hope that we may reach good personal understanding on a few of the large practical issues which now confront all nations who sincerely seek an easement of tension without loss of security.
