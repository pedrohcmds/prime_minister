As I have said, if you widen the existing distribution of the 1939–43 Star you may easily bring in 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 more people, and that would greatly affect the value of the award to those who have gained it. There will be a British war medal which will be given over the whole area, but I cannot attempt to make any pledge in the matter. The question of the issue of this widely distributed medal will be one we can take up when the war is over.
I am very well aware, but up to the present nobody has worn the two ribbons.
Only a small class is at present eligible—those who actually fought on shore. But if there are cases of those who have not received the African Star I should be glad to be informed.
If you went on like that you would give the ribbon to everybody in the country. All did pretty well.
