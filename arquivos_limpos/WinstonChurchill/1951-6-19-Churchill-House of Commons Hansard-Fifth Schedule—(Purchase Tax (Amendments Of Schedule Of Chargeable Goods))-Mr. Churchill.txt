Gentleman the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) who for a number of minutes stood stationary, and also draw your attention to the grave injury and danger that might arise if hon. Members took the opportunity of Divisions to stand about in fixed positions on the Floor of the House, whereby they might obstruct the movement of other hon. Members and lead very easily to a breach of the peace.
