It is 1938, not 1937.
My right hon. Friend was suggesting that the Government programme would be fulfilled if, by 31st March, 1937, the Air Force had been equipped only with training machines. I differ from him on that altogether. But, at any rate, we are not now in March, 1937; we have reached a very late date in March, 1938.
That is the one the Government chose.
