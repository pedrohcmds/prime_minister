Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that in the statement he has just made, he has made a considerable, albeit only a partial, advance towards the policy which we on this side of the House declared at the General Election? On 29th November we stated, in the "Unionist Policy for the Effective Control in Scotland of Scottish Affairs": 
That was 29th November; that date is quite easy to take in. Will not the right hon. Gentleman consider whether, while he is deferring to our wishes to a certain extent, he will not go the whole way and, instead of appointing what he calls a strong and independent Committee, appoint a Royal Commission, which is what we have demanded? Perhaps he has received some legal advice. At any rate, will he say whether he will appoint a Royal Commission and then we should be able, on this side of the House, to congratulate ourselves on having at any rate secured this measure of consideration for a vital Scottish matter?
No, Sir, the right hon. Gentleman has no right to suggest that this is a method of delaying. He and his party have been forced into action by our pressure.
The right hon. Gentleman did not tell us the terms of reference. Can he give us the terms of reference, and are we to take it that he has definitely decided to refuse a Royal Commission?
What I said carried forward all I had said on the subject previously.
Is this to be merely a committee of officials, or what is its composition to be? Why will the right hon. Gentleman persist in refusing the plain demand which is made, and was made six months ago, before the election, for the setting up of a Royal Commission?
I should like, if I might, to assure the right hon. Gentleman that part of my anxiety in this matter is due to my desire that the reputation which he acquired in a subordinate position at the  Foreign Office shall not be squandered now that he is the head of a Department.
