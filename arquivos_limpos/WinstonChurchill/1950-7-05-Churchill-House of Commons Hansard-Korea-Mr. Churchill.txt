"Tories bay for war"—that is the headline, but—[Interruption.]
Perhaps the hon. Member for Maldon will say that he is not responsible for the headlines but only for the text?
I understand that the hon. Member accepts the responsibility.
And also these words? Let me just read them, because the House ought to see how all this is working out: 
I know it is the hon. Member's pride that he can be neither muzzled nor led, and no doubt what we have seen in the columns of "Reynold's Newspaper" is only a bowdlerised version of the total and utter untruths which he was scattering to the world.
The cheers from the Conservative benches were for the Prime Minister when he made his declaration, while some of the benches behind him were curiously silent.
We are also told that it is being put about in many constituencies that if the Tories had been in office  there would have been war now. That is not true. If we had been in office when the news of President Truman's action arrived, we should have acted in very much the same way as His Majesty's Government have done.
I am not at all sure that we should have received from all the Ministers opposite and from all their followers the same measure of good will and support that we are giving them on this occasion. We shall not, however, allow our action to be deflected in great matters by behaviour of this kind. We believe that the electorate, in judging these matters for themselves, will be influenced by the ordinary British standards of fair play, and it is on that that we rest ourselves.
