I should like to associate my hon. Friends on this side of the House with the expressions that have been used about Jan Masaryk by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Like him, we knew Masaryk over here during the dark years of the war, and very often my right hon. Friend and I saw him and were able to appreciate the working of that competent mind and resolute, unflinching soul. We mourn his loss—it is a heavy loss—but one cannot help rejoicing, as the right hon. Gentleman has done, that the famous name he bore will continue to be an inspiration to the peoples of Czechoslovakia.
