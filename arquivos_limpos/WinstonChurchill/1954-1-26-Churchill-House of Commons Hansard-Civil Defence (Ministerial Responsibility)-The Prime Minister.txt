Lots of points are raised in that supplementary question. I am astonished, I must say, that the hon. Member should suggest that I have not read that Report. This matter has been very carefully considered as between the civil and military authorities. We found it worked very satisfactorily—or more or lesssatisfactorily—in the war, and I think the Home Secretary is the Minister who should be in charge of it.
I assure the right hon. Gentleman—I almost said my right hon. Friend, as he was in those days—I shall stand firm as a rock.
The Report is being most carefully studied by the Departments, and by none more than the Home Office. Of course, undoubtedly, what is needed to make a very keen voluntary effort in Civil Defence is a sense of alarm, of danger. Without that it is difficult, and as the feeling that, perhaps, things are a little better and the outlook a little clearer grows in the land, it has that disadvantage that people do not feel the same need to be prepared for immediate war. Well, I think we shall have to put up with that.
