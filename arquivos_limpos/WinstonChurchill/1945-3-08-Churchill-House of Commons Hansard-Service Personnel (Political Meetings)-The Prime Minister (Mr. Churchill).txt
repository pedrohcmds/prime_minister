Members of the forces are allowed to attend political meetings, but are not allowed to speak at them, as such action would amount to taking an active part in the affairs of a political organisation or party, which is forbidden by the King's Regulations. This does not apply to serving Members of Parliament, who during the war may speak on any occasion. Prospective candidates may speak in their own constituencies only.
