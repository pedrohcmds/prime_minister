As the hon. Gentleman has begun his studies, I can only hope that he will continue.
I can quite see how the idea whether any particular person has justified his existence or not arises in the mind of the right hon. Gentleman, particularly on the occasion of the debate which we are to have this afternoon.
I must apologise; I was thinking of the debate tomorrow. No doubt, it is in the right hon. Gentleman's mind. In reply to my hon. Friend, I have great respect for the memory of Sir Stafford Cripps, and I think we had better keep the discussion on the high level hitherto maintained.
I am very glad to see that the right hon. Gentleman studies this literature, which his close interest in party politics and electioneering has no doubt led him to do.
