:There are no grounds, on precedent or principle, for suggesting that the holder of an office should necessarily be re-appointed when his time expires. Nor is it any reflection on the holder of such an office, if he is not asked to serve again. Mr. Buchanan has performed valuable services for which Her Majesty's Government are sincerely obliged to him, and I am glad that he is willing to give the benefit of his experience by remaining a member of the Board.
