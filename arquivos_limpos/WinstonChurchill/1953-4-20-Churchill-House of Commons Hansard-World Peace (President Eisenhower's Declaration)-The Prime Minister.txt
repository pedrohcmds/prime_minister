I understand that we shall probably have a debate on foreign affairs on the 29th of this month, but I would rather not endeavour to forecast precisely beforehand the lines which any remarks I might have to make should take.
I think it might even hamper the movement of events in Korea towards an effective truce if I were to try to lay down conditions or make offers at the present time.
I am sure it would not be in the interests which we all have at heart for me to attempt to go into details on these matters at the present time.
