His Majesty's Government are as concerned as anyone else with the security of the communications of the British Commonwealth and Empire, with the security of the Canal, and with the best possible relations with Egypt and the continuance of our alliance with that country; and it is precisely for that reason that we are making the approach that we are making. Let me record briefly a little bit more of the history of our relations with the Egyptian people. They have sometimes been good; sometimes not so good. I can recall the course of those relations over  a good many years in this House. I remember very well the efforts that were made to try and get an agreement when Mr. Arthur Henderson was Foreign Secretary, and that nearly succeeded in 1929. A difficult period followed after that.
