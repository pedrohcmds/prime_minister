I rise to support the Motion which the Prime Minister has made, and to thank him for having made it. On the last occasion when a Privilege issue was raised in this House, it was left to the Member who raised it himself to make the Motion, but the Prime Minister, at a later stage in the proceedings, expressed his formal concurrence with the Motion. The right hon. Gentleman, in taking this action himself, has certainly acted in accordance with the high traditions of the House. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has himself made this Motion, and that the matter is to be very strenuously tested in debate, I should like to ask him and the House about two points which arise directly out of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys) is under military orders to attend  this Court of Inquiry to-morrow, and I presume that the fact that this matter is now to be referred to the Committee of Privileges means that the Government will immediately cancel this order, or that otherwise the House and you, Mr. Speaker, will see that Privilege protects the hon. Gentleman in not complying with it.
I understand the Secretary of State to say that, of course, he takes full responsibility for the decision of the Army Council, although he was not himself able to attend this particular meeting. May I ask my right hon. Friend whether he did not apprise the military members of the Army Council of the Motion which had been placed, or was about to be placed, on the Order Paper of the House by the Prime Minister, opening up an inquiry by a Select Committee into these or connected matters? If he did not, it seems to me that he placed his military men in rather a hard position.
