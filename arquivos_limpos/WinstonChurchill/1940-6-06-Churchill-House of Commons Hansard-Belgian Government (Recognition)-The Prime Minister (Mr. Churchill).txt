His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom recognise the Belgian Government at present established in France as the only legal Government of Belgium, and as therefore entitled to exercise in the name of Belgium all due authority. I need hardly add that it is the unswerving aim of His Majesty's Government, and, I am sure, also of the French Government, to secure for Belgium the effective restoration of her freedom and independence.
