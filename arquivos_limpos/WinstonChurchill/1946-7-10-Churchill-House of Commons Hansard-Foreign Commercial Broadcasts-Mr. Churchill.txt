Are we then to understand that the British public are free to listen to anything they like, and anything they can, but that the Government will exercise restraining force on what is allowed to reach their ears?
What does the right hon. Gentleman mean by saying that the Government will have their own view as to the wavelengths which are permitted to be used?
Or the "Tribune," on Egypt.
Do I gather that the Government intend to exercise a discriminatory control over the wavelengths on which the British public are allowed to hear statements made from foreign stations?
What did the right hon. Gentleman say just now?
But I was here, listening, and have the evidence of my ears to give me a very clear impression that the right hon. Gentleman was reserving to the Government powers of discrimination in respect of wavelengths.
What is meant by "at this moment"? May I remind the right hon. Gentlemanâ€”[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if he will recall the fact that during the war we, alone I think among all  the belligerent countries, allowed anything to come in over the broadcasts from other countries, knowing that the people's good sense would place it in its proper relation?
But this is peacetime jamming.
