Can we have the figures of the ration strength of the Armed Forces at the present time, if possible with the theatres; and will the right hon. Gentleman give figures at intervals on the progress of demobilisation from these total ration strengths?
My point was whether we could be informed of the total numbers at present held in the Armed Forces, because that is the datum line from which the right hon. Gentleman starts—I do not mean now, but can we be informed in a few days, or in a week?
