Yes, Sir. Not only will I give my continuing attention to this matter, but, in view of the responsibilities which Parliament has laid upon me in respect of Memoranda from the Select Committee, I read the Memorandum myself within five days of its being sent forward in August, and minuted it immediately to the Departments concerned, requesting their consideration and action. As a result of the reports which I received, I came to the conclusion that the Sub-committee were not fully informed upon the operational aspects of the questions raised, nor upon the wider questions of policy, and that it would not be wise to follow the course they recommended.
