At present the rule has been laid down that no one can have both the 1939–43 Star and the Africa Star. It would involve a very serious and complicated process to depart from this simple principle and I could not undertake to do so without a very much more detailed examination of all the reactions affecting individuals that would be involved. Two awards could not be given to the Army unless a similar duplication were permitted to the Navy and the Air Force. The complications are therefore obvious. It would be very proper, however, to raise this matter when the subject is debated.
