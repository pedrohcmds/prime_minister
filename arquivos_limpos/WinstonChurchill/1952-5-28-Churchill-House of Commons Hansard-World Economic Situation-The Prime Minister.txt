Without going into all those important topics, I should not wish to alter the substance of my answer.
The items on the agenda for the 14th Session of this Council, which opened on 20th May, again included the world economic situation, the economic development of underdeveloped countries and a report on measures for international economic stability. I should have thought that that would have included the very critical point mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman.
In any case, I am not proposing to issue invitations for a world economic conference as asked by the hon. Member.
These matters are never out of the minds of Her Majesty's Government, and, indeed, our whole future depends upon them. We are striving our utmost to improve the position from what we found it when the right hon. Gentleman left it.
I do not think in the circumstances that I need read it all.
