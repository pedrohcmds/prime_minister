The right hon. and learned Gentleman would, I suppose, agree that at the close of the war we were said to owe India approximately 1,200 million sterling as a result of defending her from invasion and conquest by Japan. It had always been kept open, as I think he will agree, that we should have the right to put in a counter claim for the immense services which we rendered in saving those 400 million people from being ravaged, pillaged and slaughtered as they would otherwise, to a large extent, have been. In what has been concluded now have we kept open until 1951 the full freedom of reviewing this question—the main question of what is called "sterling balances," which is a euphemism for British debts? Is that position open and can it be raised and examined de novo in the year 1951?
Even the fundamental issue of setting off the services rendered to India against the debt piled up under the conditions of war?
Thank you very much.
How much? What is the rate?
