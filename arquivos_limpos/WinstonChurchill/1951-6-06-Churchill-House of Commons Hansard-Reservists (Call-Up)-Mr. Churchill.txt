How are these figures to be given? Is each of the Service Ministers to render the figure separately for his Department, and are they to be circulated in the ordinary way of Questions not answered orally?
My hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Miss Ward) has asked a Question. She asked the right hon. Gentleman to give the figures collectively. He does not give them collectively, but says they should be given separately. Surely that operation should be conducted by the right hon. Gentleman?
Will the right hon. Gentleman mind answering the question, whether the answers are to be given separately by the different Ministers, or whether new Questions have to be put on the Order Paper for each of the three Ministers?
The nature of the Question is set out in the very simple terms of whether: 
If the right hon. Gentleman finds it so difficult to avoid getting into a muddle about such trivial details, how does he hope to solve our great problems?
