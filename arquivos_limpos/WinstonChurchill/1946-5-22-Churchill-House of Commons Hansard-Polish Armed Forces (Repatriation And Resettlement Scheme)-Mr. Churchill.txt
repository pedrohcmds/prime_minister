I should like to acknowledge the care and attention which His Majesty's Government have given to this very difficult question. I should like to ask in what part of the United Kingdom the second Polish Corps will be quartered immediately on its return. Where will it be placed? Is it to be placed in Scotland, because some parts of Scotland have been for a long time rather overstocked with Polish troops? That is the first question I should like to ask.
Has the right hon. Gentleman entirely closed his mind to the idea of using these extremely fine, well-disciplined troops as part of the garrison for holding Germany, in portions of Germany far removed from the Russian frontier line? Would not this be a means by which further relief could be given to our own men and a reduction made in the weight of the garrisons abroad which we have to maintain?
Would the right hon. Gentleman answer the question, which was asked just now below the Gangway, about the number and proportion who have opted to go back to Poland up to now?
How many are left?
Is that not part of the difficulty that arises from these very important and deeply interesting announcements being made at the end of Questions, and not on any subject which enables them to be commented upon?
Would not very many of these difficulties be solved if the right hon. Gentleman were to use this force to take some of the weight off us in the duties we have to discharge on the Continent? Will he not consider that? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Hon. Members say "No," but I should like the right hon.  Gentleman to consider it, because it seems to me that nothing but advantage and simplicity would come from itâ€”much stricter control; there need be no contact with other countries beyond the German border; and there would be relief to the British burden, and also a relief to the British labour market. Surely some consideration might be given to these points?
