I have not had an opportunity of verifying the quotation to which the hon. Member refers.
I do not think it would be within my power to take a decision of that kind.
There have been a number of experiments of which record has reached us of explosions in Russia, and then there were those which took place a year ago under the authority of the United States. But it is one thing to form a view about what would be the most agreeable course to be pursued in these matters by either of these two countries and quite another thing to persuade them, still more to compel them, not to have tests.
I am sure that it would have been a very good thing if none of these things had ever been discovered at all. At what stage in their discovery they should be arrested, and with what advantage to particular nations that are experimenting in them, is a much more complicated question to decide.
We have a great deal of information on this extremely complex question and we are continuing  to pursue our researches intensively. As the hon. Member will now be aware, Her Majesty's Government, together with others, have proposed that an international conference of scientists on atomic energy be organised during the coming summer, and a resolution to this effect is now under discussion in the Political Committee of the United Nations. This conference will doubtless consider, among other matters, the effects of radiation on human beings.
I am quite sure that all the information which is available here and in the United States on such aspects is at the disposal of our expert authorities.
I should like to see what they were before I even imagined that I had the authority to decide such a question.
The hon. and learned Gentleman might, with all his eloquence and learning, go to both the Americans and the Russians—[An HON. MEMBER: "The right hon. Gentleman is Prime Minister."]—and suggest to them that they should alter the course on which they have embarked, but whether or not that would result in anything more than an abrupt termination of the talk, I cannot tell.
