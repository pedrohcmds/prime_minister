The right hon. Gentleman is only repeating, with certain other words added, the Question which he has already asked, and to which I have already replied.
There is no question of delay. I have explained to the right hon. Gentleman the processes now going forward with regard to the formation of the Council of Europe, and I am explaining to him that he is premature in asking for a decision now. The answer will come in due course.
The right hon. Gentleman is again mistaken. As I explained in my reply, it is hoped that other Governments besides those of the Brussels Treaty Powers will be taking part, but they have certainly not yet come to their decision.
No decision has been come to on this matter, one way or the other.
No question of decent behaviour or impropriety arises in the fact that a Government decision is taken at the proper time and not when the right hon. Gentleman wants it.
The hon. Gentleman is only repeating in more solicitous language, what the right hon. Gentleman asked.
