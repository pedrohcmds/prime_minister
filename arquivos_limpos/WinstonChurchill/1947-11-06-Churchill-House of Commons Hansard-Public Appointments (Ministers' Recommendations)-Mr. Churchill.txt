On what Question is the right hon. Gentleman speaking?
What Question?
The right hon. Gentleman was asked a question and declined to answer it, and he is now making a speech. I rise to a point of Order.
rose—
It would be a pity if this ended inconclusively. May I ask  the Leader of the House, as he raised the matter originally on a point of Order, whether he will, in fact, agree to an inquiry into the matter which is alleged?
His what?
With great respect, Sir —[HON. MEMBERS: "Order."]—I rise to a point of Order. Having listened to your Rulings, I understood that you directed the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) to withdraw the words which he had uttered applying to the hon. and gallant Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd)—[Interruption.] —I am content to wait. He withdrew the words which he had used, namely, "offensive lie"
A few moments ago, with my own ears I heard the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne use the expression "offensive lie," I heard you ask him to withdraw, and I heard him very becomingly defer to your Ruling. What I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, is that my hon, and gallant Friend the Member for East Renfrew did not rest his case on the use of an offensive expression but upon a charge. Therefore, I ask you if you would discriminate in your Ruling between the duty of hon. Members to withdraw offensive expressions which they use, and to withdraw charges—[Interruption.]—I am not speaking to hon. Members opposite, but. to Mr. Speaker—and to withdraw charges which it is perhaps their duty to bring to the notice of the House of Commons.
On a point of Order. We are now on the question of what is a Parliamentary expression and what is not. I was always brought up to believe that "lie" was an unparliamentary expression, but greater latitude has been given to that in late years. "Liar" is unparliamentary, but "lie" has often hitherto apparently been passed. The hon. Member below the Gangway, very properly, withdrew his expression at your request. Therefore, "offensive lie" has been regarded this afternoon as unparliamentary. I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, whether the expression "political nepotism" is unparliamentary. Is it wrong for the Opposition, or for any Member of the Opposition, or my hon. and gallant Friend, to put down a Motion on the Order Paper attacking the Government in which the expression "political nepotism" occurs? We must have the freedom of the use of language to describe the processes which are going on at the present time.
