A scheme is at present being developed by which any man or woman discharged from any of the three Services on grounds of neurosis or temporary instability who appears likely to need social service care can receive it. This may imply medical treatment, the finding of suitable work or other help. The discharged man will at his own request be put in touch with a suitable civilian social agency. Work of this type has already been done informally, but it is hoped in future to make it much more widely available. The Ministry of Pensions is fully informed of the facts relating to all discharges and arranges continuance of hospital treatment where necessary. It is neither desirable nor legally correct to notify medical facts about individuals who are discharged to civil authorities in any automatic way.
