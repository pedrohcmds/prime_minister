I understand that the date of Remembrance Day was very carefully considered by the then Government in 1945 and 1946 in consultation with representatives of the Churches and the British Legion and with Commonwealth Governments, and that many possible dates, including those suggested by the hon. Member, were considered. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition announced on 19th June, 1946, that the King had approved a recommendation that Remembrance Sunday should be celebrated on the Sunday before 11th November, unless 11th or 12th November be a Sunday. Her Majesty's Government have no intention of making any change now.
