I thought the right hon. Gentleman made that treaty.
I beg pardon, the right hon. Gentleman was referring to a later treaty; I thought it was the 1921–22 Treaty. But I should say that even those ports would have been of little use to us if, as a matter of fact, it had led to strong hostility among the people of the country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That is, I believe, the fact. We are proposing this, first of all, because in the preliminary exchanges of views which have taken place between the British and Egyptian negotiators, and on the basis of the advice which we have received from all those who are in a position to give us advice, or very well qualified by long knowledge of Egypt—all the advice given to us has convinced us that in order that the alliance should continue with the same mutual confidence and success as in the past, it is essential to take as the departure the complete freedom and independence of Egypt.
Yes, certainly. What we are endeavouring to work out with the Egyptians is how we can best get those facilities; how, and in what time, it will be possible to withdraw our troops and get rid of the very large installations that we have there; and how, with them, we can arrange to carry out our obligations for the defence of the Canal. I entirely agree with what the right hon. Gentleman has said about our responsibility in this matter, and we are trying to arrange the best possible way of fulfilling our responsibilities. That can only be done with the hearty good will of the Egyptian people, and in this matter the period of the withdrawal of our Forces will be a matter to be worked out by experts. It depends on physical and administrative factors.
Yes, I brought this draft before the Dominion Prime Ministers and discussed it with them. [HON. MEMBERS: "Did they agree?"] Well, I did not come to this House to—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—His Majesty's Government take full responsibility. I discussed it with the Dominion representatives very fully. They agreed that this was the best method of approach.
Of course they were consulted before the decision.
The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. He was not there. He was not there when we discussed this. We decided on this draft and considered that it was the right line of approach, and naturally we brought it before the Dominions' representatives, but I am not attempting to shelter myself by putting responsibility on others. I am saying they were fully consulted.
The hon. and gallant Member could not have heard me say exactly the contrary with regard to the Chiefs of Staff.
I say for the third time that this matter was discussed with the Chiefs of Staff, and they agreed that this approach was the best way in which we could meet the present situation, in order to secure the objective we had of the safety of the Canal zone.
What I said was that obviously if negotiations break down, the original Treaty still stands.
