I should like an indication from the right hon. Gentleman of his intentions.
I beg to move, "That the Chairman do report Progress and ask leave to sit again."
Might I ask the right hon. Gentleman what he means by "a reasonable hour today"? Human judgment varies so much as to what is reasonable.
If we go on beyond 10 o'clock, the debate set down for Friday will never arrive. Thursday will have overlapped Friday.
I feel quite sure that I shall be allowed to express my obligation to the right hon. Gentleman for having made a plain and clear statement of his desires and intentions. For out part, we have listened with great interest to them, and we see no season why the Government should not pursue that course. We cannot enter into an agreement as to when the debate should be brought to a conclusion. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] Clause 23 is a very important Clause and raises large principles. Moreover, we are now in the light of day. The reports will be available to the public of what takes place in the Committee. That leaves Clause 24 for next week. Naturally, we have that before us. I cannot give the right hon. Gentleman any assurance, but we shall watch with interest how Government business proceeds.
I find difficulty in withdrawing. I feel bound to say that after the excellent and admirable night we have passed, I think the right thing would be to report Progress at the point now reached. We have done a good hard span of work. Therefore, I think I shall press my Motion to a Division. Otherwise, we shall not in any way alter the procedure we have indicated.
