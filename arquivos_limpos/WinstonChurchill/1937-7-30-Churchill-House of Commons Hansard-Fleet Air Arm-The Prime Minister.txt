I regret as much as the right hon. Gentleman that it was not possible to come to a decision before. Of course, if we had we should have given the House an opportunity of discussing it. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that the decision was not delayed in order to deprive the House of that opportunity. It was reached at the earliest possible moment.
The question of training is one which will have to be worked out by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry in co-operation with one another, and at the present we have not attempted to define the exact lines of agreement. I think it will be found possible to combine control with a certain amount of responsibility on each side without in any way injuring efficiency.
That is another point which, obviously, must be decided by the two Departments after they have had an opportunity of considering the matter.
There must be training of the personnel of the Fleet Air Arm on shore.
Again, that is a matter for the Admiralty and the Air Force to consider what is the best plan. I should imagine, for example, that it might be that the Admiralty would have a portion of an aerodrome which is now under the Air Force, and that in another case they might have an aerodrome entirely on their own. I do not think we can say exactly what the decision will be at this moment.
Yes, Sir.
That is what I have said. The broad principle has been determined, but a great many details have to be settled, and I have every reason to suppose that they will be settled amicably by co-operation between the Admiralty and the Air Force. There is no reason why hon. Members should not raise this question on the Motion for the Adjournment, and if they do I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence will be present.
The Government decision, as taken, and now made public, is final. As far as it can settle the controversy it has settled it. We cannot prevent individuals from still firing shots but we hope they will refrain from doing so, because it is desirable in the public interest that this controversy should be settled.
I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman should suggest that the Departments are not loyally going to carry out this decision. I have had an assurance from both that they intend to do so, and I entirely accept that assurance. What I say is that I cannot prevent individuals over whom I have no authority firing shots if they think fit.
Yes, Sir.
