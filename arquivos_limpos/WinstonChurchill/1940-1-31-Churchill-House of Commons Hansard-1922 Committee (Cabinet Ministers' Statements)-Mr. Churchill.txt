I would refer the hon. Member to the reply which the Prime Minister gave yesterday to my hon. Friend the Member for East Fife (Mr. Henderson Stewart). I hope to continue the practice of making from time to time full statements to the House on the progress of the war at sea.
If I received an invitation, I should have the greatest pleasure in complying with it.
