We shall, of course, give the fullest possible details. With regard to the first point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, we have to consider the position, as I stated, of the British communities and representatives in this disturbed area. Over a long period there has been civil war. It was decided that it was wise to keep a vessel at Nanking. It is therefore a matter for decision by those on the spot as to when relief should take place. If it is put off all the time, because of a possible danger—and it is very difficult when there are irregular forces on one side—we should never get that relief, and so I think a decision had to be come to. The right hon. Gentleman would notice that there was talk of an armistice, and the armistice expired but hostilities were not  opened. A period of waiting then ensued to consider the position. Then, when there was an ultimatum, it was decided to relieve this ship in time before the ultimatum expired. In our view, the commanding officer there on the spot exercised a right judgment.
I am afraid the right hon. Gentleman could not have followed what I said, because it was pointed out that the voyage would have been completed 24 hours before zero hour. That is the reply to that. With regard to the allocation of ships and the rest, I do not think I could make any further statement on that. It is a matter we could well debate.
The right hon. Gentleman, I think, clearly recognised, as he said just now, that he could not expect a statement on that matter to be made today. I have said that I shall give the fullest information. The situation is still fluid, but certainly we shall make a statement on the position.
I have said I could not make a statement on that.
On the first point, I have not got the exact date by me, but it was a considerable time ago. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will remember that the Chinese Government moved to Canton, that various changes in the Government took place, and that they subsequently came back to Nanking. For a considerable period of weeks, indeed I think months, there has been the passage of our ships and the ships of other nations up the Yangtse. I think one would be entitled to say that it was notified on every occasion and there was no objection. As a matter of fact, this practice has been allowed.
The decision was announced in the House that we did not propose to withdraw our nationals, and that decision was taken in consultation with other nationals there. I think it is right that they should remain.
I think I tried to point out to the House that there had been this question of additional tension over a great period—that had been going on for a very long time with rumours of imminent crossings—and, therefore, they did as a matter of fact delay the ordinary relief because of the alleged termination of an armistice. Then there came the extension of the armistice and the opportunity was taken of that extension to effect the relief. I think that was right.
I did not say that this was a routine matter on the kind of lines that one could either do it or not; there had to be the supplies and there had to be the relief, and the commander on the spot had to consider what was the time to do it. I have been through the dates very often, but this was the time selected as, otherwise, he might not have been able to reach them at all. He considered—and I. think he was right in thinking that, in view of the evidence available and actions of the past—that the relief could be effected during this pause.
We have had no answer from the Communist authorities.
As I have already stated, we have made and are making every effort to get in touch with the Communist authorities, but so far we have not been able to get a letter through.
I would prefer to have these detailed questions put on the Order Paper; they do not arise directly out of this incident.
The hon. Member is, of course, quite wrong. I have no information as to what the Kuomintang authorities were likely to do. I have already told the House that our information was that hostilities would not begin until the time given on the 21st. Had this firing not taken place before the ending of that armistice, there would have been no question of the ship being hit.
I do not think that the hon. and gallant Member quite understands that we were engaged on a peaceful mission. We were not engaged in staging a punitive war, and the vessels were going up and down the Yangtse on their lawful occasion.
I have already pointed out that American ships based at Shanghai had been up and down the Yangtse quite recently.
I answered that we were not engaged in warfare; we were engaged in a peaceful mission.
Every possible effort will be made to get the names, and the fullest possible information will be given as soon as the names come in.
As I have told the right hon. Gentleman, we are perfectly willing to have a Debate. We want to take every possible step to protect the communities in China—our British community; that is one of the points we have to bear in mind in dealing with this matter.
I am not prepared to state in advance any steps with regard to the movement of any forces in this area. I am quite well aware that aircraft are used in warfare, but this was not a matter of warfare at all. There was no suggestion of making an attack anywhere at all. We were engaged in the peaceful process of bringing supplies up the river and it would have been quite unusual to have provided a bomber force or anything like that in conjunction with peaceful operations of that kind.
I naturally leave this matter to be one for the commanders on the spot to deal with. I am not sheltering myself and I take full responsibility, but I am now being asked to answer detailed questions about how this operation of keeping a warship at Nanking should be conducted and how those reliefs should be done. I am repeating the point that we were engaged in a peaceful occupation. The suggestion seems to be that we were staging something like an operation. We were doing nothing of the kind.
I cannot make any further statement except that all possible steps are being taken.
I thought it was quite clear from my statement that we were unable to contact the Communist authorities. There could be no possible question of making any apology.
I have already stated—and I am sure the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford will agree—that whatever steps we are taking, we cannot make a public announcement of the exact steps that we are taking.
I certainly could not answer that without notice.
I thought I had already made it clear to the House that we did every possible thing to contact the Communist forces and that we could not get any message through.
If my hon. Friend will study my statement he will see that that was an addition I made saying "afterwards"; we had already done it before.
Any decisions for action in this matter were taken by the men on the spot at the time. I have given full information to the House; I cannot give more information of what occurred than that which I have given. We simply have this information.
This matter was a matter within the responsibiity of the local commander. He consulted with His Majesty's Ambassador, but there was no reference back here before action was taken.
No one has yet pointed out exactly what the aircraft would have done in this matter.
In any further Debate I am quite prepared to answer any questions. All I can say now is that this was a matter which was decided by the authorities on the spot. No suggestion or order was given from here that aircraft either should or should not be used. This was a matter in which, whatever operations were undertaken, were undertaken by those on the spot. In my view they took the right line in the decision they took.
I am quite sure the right hon. Gentleman would not think it right that day-to-day meticulous orders should be given to local commanders to carry out. No commander would wish to have them.
I am not prepared to take that from the right hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Gentleman knows quite well that there has been this difficult situation for weeks along the Yangtse.
He knows that there have been rumours of crossings, and rumours of an armistice. We are keeping in touch with the situation, but a particular occasion like this is one for decision. There is no question of sheltering behind any commander on the spot. The commander on the spot took action. I approve his action. I support his action. That does not say that all the time from the Admiralty, the man on the spot, who knows the exact conditions, should be receiving detailed orders.
He is in London at the moment.
No, I cannot answer that now.
No aircraft at Shanghai.
Hong Kong.
The hon. and gallant Gentleman does not quote me correctly. I said that no one on the Opposition side had suggested exactly what they could have done about it.
I cannot answer as to the exact time in detail without notice. If the hon. Gentleman will put down a Question I shall answer it.
