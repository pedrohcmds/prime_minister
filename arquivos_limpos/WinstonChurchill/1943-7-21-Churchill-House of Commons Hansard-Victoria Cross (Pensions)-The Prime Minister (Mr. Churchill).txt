As my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister informed my hon. Friend on 29th June, the normal pensions payable to recipients of the Victoria Cross may be increased in cases of need to £75. This  figure was fixed in 1921. Further inquiries have been made, but they do not show any evidence of general complaint as to the adequacy of this special provision. I do not think any change in this well-established practice is called for.
