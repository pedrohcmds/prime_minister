As I explained yesterday, I understand that the reference to a plot was not to the putting forward of the Schuman scheme. I quite agree that a full report was given, but I understand it was made clear at the time—it is always a difficult thing to do in a  speech—that that particular sentence applied only to Parliamentary proceedings and not to the question of the Schuman Plan.
I have, naturally, consulted my right hon. Friend on the matter.
I have already explained this matter. I naturally did not answer on the spur of the moment. I naturally asked my right hon. Friend about the speech, and he made it perfectly plain to me that at this point in his speech he turned to the question of Parliamentary proceedings, and that the word"plot" referred to the activities of right hon. and hon. Members opposite.
I said that the word"plot" referred to the proceedings in this House, and not to the Schuman Plan.
No, Sir.
My right hon. Friend was referring to the fact that there was a proposal to hand over these industries to an irresponsible authority and—
The Schuman proposal.
I am answering the hon. and learned Member for Hove (Mr. Marlowe). I think that it is a perfectly fair comment, on looking at the scheme, to say that one would be putting into the hands of an irresponsible authority powers to deal on a very wide basis with all these industries.
