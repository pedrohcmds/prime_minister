Many people thought in July of last year that Spain would enter the war against us, and I think that it is very largely due to the brilliant discharge of his duties in Spain that our relations with that country have tended to improve and not to deteriorate at this critical time.
I do not know what is meant by the last remark about another fait accompli at all. This policy has been most carefully considered, and the state of our affairs in every part of the world does not allow matters of this kind to be handled in a rough and reckless or debonair fashion. We do not wish to do anything which would give any excuse for a breach at the present time between us and the Spanish Government; and I certainly consider that the starving condition of the people of Spain fully justifies assistance being given by Great Britain, and by the United States, if she chooses so to act, irrespective of whether any expressions of gratitude are forthcoming or not.
