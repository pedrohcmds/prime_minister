I hope that when a statement is made of our relations with the United States it will cover not only divergencies on points of policy, but also those great factors of unity without which our survival would be in danger, and theirs, possibly, in danger, too.
I think it is quite possible that a general statement upon the relations might be advantageous, but not a statement on the differences of opinion at this juncture.
That is just an example of the tendency I was deprecating. I must say that I think it utterly untrue to suggest that President Eisenhower called my right hon. and learned Friend a liar.
