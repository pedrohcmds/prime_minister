The booklets prepared by the Army authorities are intended for the soldier but, as my hon. Friend is no doubt aware, they are also used by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. I am advised that a somewhat different variant would be required for the Civil Defence Services and other civilians. The several Departments concerned will receive copies of these booklets and may of course reproduce any articles which they consider helpful to their work.
