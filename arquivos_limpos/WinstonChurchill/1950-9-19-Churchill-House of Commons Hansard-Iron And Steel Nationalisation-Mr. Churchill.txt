The right hon. Gentleman could surely find other things in life to laugh at besides those which do not include himself. Otherwise life might be rather gloomy for him. I was saying—a fanatical intelligentsia obsessed by economic fallacies.
The hon. Member may set himself up as a judge, but I must ask him to take his place in the general assembly of the House and not to assume that his will be the casting vote upon a decision of such moment.
We must also preserve our sense of proportion. It seems difficult to believe that the activities of the small number of Communists in our midst could at the present time inflict upon our defensive effort, or upon our national unity, anything like the injury that will be done to us all by this Act of party sabotage.
We shall, if we should obtain the responsibility and the power in any future which is possible to foresee, repeal the existing Iron and Steel Act,  irrespective of whether the vesting date has occurred or not. We shall then proceed to revive the solution which has been set forth in the Trades Union Congress Report and which is accepted by the Iron and Steel Federation, and we shall set up again the tripartite Board, which has been proved to have worked so well. This would be the policy if we had the power, either before or after another General Election.
I do not withdraw a word of it.
The right hon. Gentleman's argument seems to have great difficulty, no doubt not through any fault of his own, in distinguishing between truth and falsehood.
I really did not suggest at all that this document abandoned the principle and the aim of nationalisation. On the contrary, if my memory serves me, I read a passage which showed that that was not so. Why I quoted the document was to show the very large measure of agreement which existed in regard to the control of a particular industry through a statutory board.
I did not say that.
Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me to express a hope that he will, before he sits down, return for a few moments to the actual subject of the Motion before the House, and tear himself away from these intriguing electoral calculations in which his soul is buried?
I have stated what would be our policy.
That depends on tonight.
I consider that a Government which has not got a majority behind its Parliamentary representation should feel itself considerably limited and restricted in its right to make far-reaching changes of policy.
Nor had the General Strike.
How high was the level at that time, when the Irish Nationalist Party ranged itself with the nation, and Ireland was described as the brightest spot in the British Empire.
