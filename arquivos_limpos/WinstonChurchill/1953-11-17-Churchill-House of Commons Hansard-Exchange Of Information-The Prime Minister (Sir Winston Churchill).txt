I have not quite completed the dispositions which will be made for answering Questions in the House generally upon the subject of atomic energy, I could not myself undertake to deal with this extremely specialised and complicated subject, and therefore I am going to propose to the House that a Minister shall be made specially chargeable. However, there are certain Questions which, though they appear to deal with the atomic issue, raise matters which are high diplomacy. This first one was naturally one which should be answered by the Minister of Supply, but I have asked my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to deal with the next two very complicated Questions. [AN HON. MEMBER:"Oh."] Certainly, we are very proud to have his assistance, and I hope that the hon. Member will remember how very much easier it is to put highly complex and difficult Questions upon the Order Paper than to give clear and positive answers.
