I certainly see the difficulties but I do not see a way round them.
The courts will have to decide upon these matters in the absence of legislation by Parliament.
I certainly think the matter must always be considered but although the courts have the same difficulties as we have, it is their business most specifically to solve them as each case arises—[HON. MEMBERS: "No"]—in the absence of legislation.
It will be so much easier to define that date when we have actually reached it.
