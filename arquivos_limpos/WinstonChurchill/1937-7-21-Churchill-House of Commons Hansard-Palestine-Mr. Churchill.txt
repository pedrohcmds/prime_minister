Will the right hon. Gentleman say a word on the question of the defence of these various areas? What is to be the method of defence of the Jewish State and of the Arab State, and what are to be the obligations of this country in preventing armed clashes between the two? We should like to hear something about that.
I should like for one moment to make my apology to the House and to say that whatever has happened is entirely my fault, because with a singular lack of that precipitancy for which I have of ten been blamed, I did not notice the point upon which my hon. Friend finished his speech. I thought there were two or three more words in his sentence, and therefore I did not immediately jump up. I will gladly give way to any hon. Member, but I do not think that it has ever  been the rule that the first person who gets up is the person to be called. [Interruption.] The hon. Member who has just sat down is clearly a strong partisan of the Arab point of view. He has told us how he has served in the field with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster—
I misunderstood the hon. Member, but, at any rate, he is well acquainted with the Arab problems and speaks with a strong feeling for their point of view. I do not consider that we are altogether in a free and easy position in this House in regard to this question. Pledges have been given on both sides. The pledge which all the world regarded with considerable attention, and which was mentioned by the Secretary of State in his speech, is undoubtedly the Balfour Declaration of policy put forward by the War Cabinet in the crisis of the Great War. It is a delusion to suppose that this was a mere act of crusading enthusiasm or quixotic philanthropy. On the contrary, it was a measure taken, as the right hon. Gentleman who led us in the crisis of the War knows, in the dire need of the War with the object of promoting the general victory of the Allies, for which we expected and received valuable and important assistance. We cannot brush that aside and start afresh as though it had never been given, and deal with this matter as if we had no obligations or responsibility. Therefore, I am bound to say that upon this issue, having studied the question as far as I can and having some personal connection and responsibility for it, I should have preferred the Government to have persevered in the old policy of persuading one side to concede and the other to forbear, and to carry forward that policy, hard and heavy though it may be, with all its inconveniences.
My intention was to draw a distinction between approving of the policy and approving of further inquiries into the policy.
The Noble Lord is ignoring past history.
I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, in line 1, to leave out from the word "proposals" to the end of the proposed Amendment, and to add: 
For the convenience of the House and with the wish of the House, I should be perfectly ready to move my Amendment in this revised form.
