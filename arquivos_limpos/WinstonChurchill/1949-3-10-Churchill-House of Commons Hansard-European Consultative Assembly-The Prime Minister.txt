Yes, Sir. I am aware of the Motion to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, but I am not able to make any statement on the question  of the United Kingdom representation in the Consultative Assembly until all the Governments concerned have finally settled the constitution of the Council of Europe.
I should hope it will not be long delayed now.
I could not say more exactly. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will put a question to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
The right hon. Gentleman is founding his question on assumptions that he chooses to make. I have neither affirmed nor denied any of these propositions; I have merely informed him that it is usual to wait until a constitution has been formed and agreed upon before taking action. That is all there is to it. The right hon. Gentleman jumps off before the pistol.
