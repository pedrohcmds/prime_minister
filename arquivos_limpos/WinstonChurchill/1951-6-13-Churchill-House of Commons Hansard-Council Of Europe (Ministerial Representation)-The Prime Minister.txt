No, the reason is the reason which I have given. The constitutional position is very different in Continental countries.
My right hon. Friend will be very grateful for that remark.
The right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. The whole basis of representation is that individual members should speak in an individual capacity, and, as the right hon. Gentleman would find out if he was in office, there is an obvious difficulty in having Ministers there owing to the confusion as to whether what is spoken by a Minister is spoken as a member of the Government or in an individual capacity.
As I have already mentioned, the constitutional position on the Continent is different from what it is in this country.
