In view of the formation of a Government embracing the three main political parties, His Majesty's Government is of opinion that the provision of the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, relating to the payment of a salary to the Leader of the Opposition, is in abeyance for the time being. As at present advised I do not think that amending legislation as suggested by my hon. Friend is necessary.
