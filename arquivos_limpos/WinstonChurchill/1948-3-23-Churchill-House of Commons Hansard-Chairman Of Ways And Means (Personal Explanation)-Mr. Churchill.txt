I feel that the course which the Prime Minister has adopted in accepting this Motion will be in the general interests of the House and in the interests of all parties concerned. We are obliged to him for accepting the Motion. The matter is not one of a personal character but touches certain principles which should, at any rate, be explored and pronounced upon by the House. With regard to what the right hon. Gentleman said as to the alteration of procedure, we are, of course, in the hands of Mr. Speaker, but on this side of the House we have a strong feeling that this matter should be disposed of as quickly as possible in the interests of all concerned.
