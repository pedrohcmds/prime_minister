Will the Prime Minister consider giving an opportunity for Debate on this subject, if possible before we separate for Whitsuntide? It seems to be one on which the House should be entitled, not necessarily immediately, but after some consideration, to express its views and opinions.
I do not wish to press the Government at all on the immediate or actual date. I do not at all mind this matter being forestalled by discussion in the public Press. That is very healthy. But I hope that I may assume that the Prime Minister will give us the facilities for a Debate on this matter, if possible before we leave for the Whitsuntide Recess.
It is a little more than the usual channels, because we are bringing the Prime Minister into it himself.
With great respect, we feel very strongly that we should have the text before us. Of course, if it has been published in the newspapers we do not wish to press for the expense of printing a White Paper; but are we to have the full text before us or not?
With very great respect, we are entitled to the text. We are entitled to see what has been said. I really ask the Prime Minister to make sure that we get the text. Of course, if it has been given to the Press, we do not want to waste money on printing and paper; but, if not, we ought to have it as a Parliamentary Paper.
