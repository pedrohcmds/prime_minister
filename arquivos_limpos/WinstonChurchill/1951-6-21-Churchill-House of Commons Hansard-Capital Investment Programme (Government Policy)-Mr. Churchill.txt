Is it not rather abrupt to turn down all idea of a White Paper, even supposing it could not have the full precision of previous yearsâ€”if, indeed, that quality has resided in the documents then published? Could it not be issued under the necessary reserves? Could not we have the most detailed and careful statement that the right hon. Gentleman can prepare under the reserves, even if some of the details are necessarily  I omitted? Surely we ought to have some thing more than just these three pages of typescript read out to us before very large: changes affecting the social life of the: whole people are, as it were, tacitly assented to by the House? May I ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he will not reconsider this matter and give' us the best White Paper he can, and then we can consider in what form the matter should be debated or carried further.
