We have heard with very great regret the statement of the Prime Minister. While there is the technical point about the need for a Government Resolution on a matter involving finance, it has been the practice to accept the decision of the House of Commons. During the time of the Government of which I was Prime Minister, there were two outstanding occasions. One was the suspension of a Member and the other was the question of capital punishment. In both those cases the House took a view contrary to that held by the Government, but the Government felt in duty bound to accept the opinion of the House of Commons.
The right hon. Gentleman will remember that it was as a matter of courtesy that the Opposition provided a Supply Day for the purpose of discussing the Report by a Committee set up by this House—an important Committee representative of Members on both sides—to deal with this matter, and that there was, therefore, an obligation on the Government to give time to discuss the Report. It was purely a matter of courtesy that we allowed it to be taken in our time.
We shall consider what is the right course to take in view of the fact that the Government have disregarded the decision of the House of Commons.
