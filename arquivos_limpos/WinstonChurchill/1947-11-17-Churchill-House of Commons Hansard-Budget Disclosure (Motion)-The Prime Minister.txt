Yes, Sir, my attention has been called to this Motion. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) made a very full and frank statement in public on the matter. He has paid a very heavy penalty for his indiscretion, and I know that he has the sympathy of Members in the misfortune which has come upon him. I am not myself able to see what further information is required in the matter, but neither my right hon. Friend nor the Government would oppose further inquiry—because there is nothing whatever to conceal in the matter—if it was thought necessary. To oppose it might seem to suggest there was something. There is nothing whatever to reveal beyond what my right hon. Friend has already announced to the House. Therefore, if a desire is evinced to set up a Select Committee the Government would not oppose it.
I understand that such a Motion is debatable and I should like to consider it when it is definitely put down.
No, Sir. The Government considered this matter, and the position they have taken up is that if there is a demand for an inquiry the Government will not oppose it.
