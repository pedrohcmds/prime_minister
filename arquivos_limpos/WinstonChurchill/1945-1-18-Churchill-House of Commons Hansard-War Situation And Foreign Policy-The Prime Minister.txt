Well, I speak according to the best information I have.
I have spared no pains to try to learn what I believe are the facts. I consider myself far better informed on this matter than I was a month or six weeks ago, but what I have learned with great pains and patience has led me to a strengthening of my original conclusions, and among them is undoubtedly the conclusion that the E.L.A.S. armed bands, at any rate for the last two years, played very little part against the Germans. Now, I really cannot argue with my hon. Friend. No doubt he and some of those who hold his views will have an opportunity of extolling their glorious deeds. I, personally, am not prepared to pay them anything like the tributes which are paid to the heroic French or Belgian Maquis, or to the men in Italy who are in the mountains fighting their desperate battle. It seems to me they took aid from us with their eyes on more important local matters after the general war was over.
or army of brigands, if the hon. Member wishes—I shall have to tell the Committee much worse about them than that before I have finished. This was about to take place. Almost all the police stations in Athens and the Piraeus had been occupied or stormed by E.L.A.S. forces, some with the slaughter of every single inmate. Firing was widespread throughout the city—it was growing, it was approaching. General Scobie signalled: 
It is fully within the rights——
Evidently, the chance remark which I made the other day to the hon. Member has stung him deeply. I shall continue to probe carefully the exact political shade which he adopts. With regard to this document, I think I should be quite ready to lay the telegram which I quoted.
The whole document, subject to anything that may be excluded on the grounds of the public interest.
Yes, on account of public security. There is a good deal more in it than I have read out. Some of the news may not be any more palatable to the hon. Member.
I am not accepting it at all as an absolute rule, that in time of war documents can be quoted without  the most careful survey by the Government. That is absolutely necessary. In times when Blue Books were given to the House, even in peace, frequent excisions were made and indicated by dots by Ministers responsible for the safety of the country.
The hon. Member may not only have the pleasure of having it told to him but of reading it in the document.
The hon. Member continues to presume. I am reading the facts and he does not like the facts. I am telling him the truth and he fears the truth. These facts reflect on those whom he has so thoughtlessly championed, and I will give him further warning. There is a great deal more to come, and I think that the Committee has a right to hear it. [Interruption.] When I quote from the colonel of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and say he gathered his information from the advanced dressing station, where he examined a number of these victims, the hon. Gentleman opposite immediately tries to suggest it is all some fake propaganda. He did not use those words, but the whole sense of his interruption was to cast doubt on an officer who has not the slightest interest, political or otherwise, to do anything but collect, gather and convey the truth. Mr. Leeper adds: 
I think there is a great difference between putting people to death for the crime of rebellion, or bringing them to penal processes, and making sure that your Government Departments are not full of people who are working for the other side. I am dealing with the whole question of amnesty which relates to the penal processes of law, such as imprisonment or sentences of death, and an amnesty certainly does not mean that persons who are not trusted by the Government of the day will immediately be made Cabinet Ministers, or that employees who were found to have left their posts in the crisis and taken part in the fighting on the opposite side to the Government of the day, should be reinstated or left in their positions. No one can stand for that, and I want to be very careful not to lead the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale into any ideas that I am promising something that goes beyond the actual words I have used.
I finished before lunch dealing with the Greek question, and I quoted a statement by a British officer about the bodies which were being dug up. I had not got his name then, but it has since arrived by telegraph and is Captain R. F. G. Blackler, of the Royal Artillery. He gave an eye-witness account.
All republicans are not revolutionaries nor all monarchists reactionaries.
I might say that General Scobie's position is rather a peculiar one, because, as the British troops gathered, the command passed from him to General Hawkesworth because of the size and scale of the operation. General Scobie has throughout been in a quasi-political position, in the closest negotiations with all the different quarters. He has not been simply a military commander charged purely with the application or non-application of military force.
No doubt he took it from the words I used on the spur of the moment.
Or murder.
They fully agree that outsiders should be present, whether from this country or from our Allies. There would be no difficulty in seeing that any election is fairly conducted, as far as the present Greek Government are concerned, by outside observers.
The right hon. Gentleman said so at the time.
