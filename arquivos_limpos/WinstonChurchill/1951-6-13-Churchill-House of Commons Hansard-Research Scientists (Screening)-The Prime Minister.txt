Inquiries into an alien scientist's background and associations are made in his country of origin whenever it is practicable to do so.
Obviously I cannot give details of that. Inquiries are made wherever possible in the country of origin but at times, especially during the war, it was quite impossible to make inquiries, and such alien scientists as there are were mostly taken on when they were refugees from oppression in other countries, when those inquiries could not be made.
I think the right hon. Gentleman is quite right in that.
Perhaps if the hon. Gentleman wants to ask a question about a specific point he will put it down.
