We are dealing here with expenses which have to be found out of Votes provided by this House—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—or at any rate that place a burden on the taxpayers of this country—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]. I do not think I shall complicate the making of this return by extending it to the inordinate limits that the right hon. Gentleman suggests.
Why should the right hon. Gentleman be so afraid of the House getting this information?
