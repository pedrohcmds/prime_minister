<p class="">I beg to move, <blockquote><q>"That this House approves the proposal of His Majesty's Government to devote to the purposes of the National Memorial to His late Majesty King George the Fifth certain property in the City of Westminster now vested in the Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings, namely, part of the site now occupied by Number 5, Old Palace Yard, and the sites formerly occupied by Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4, Old Palace Yard, and by Numbers 1, 2, 3 and 3a. Poets' Corner, to the intent that the land comprised therein should form an open space surrounding a statue of His late Majesty King George the Fifth."</q></blockquote> This Motion, which stands in the name of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself, is a fresh and, I hope, a decisive stage in the history of the somewhat long delayed decision on the question of the Memorial to the late King George the Fifth. When King George the Fifth died in January, 1936, there was a general and spontaneous desire on the part of the nation to find some means of expressing its sense of the great public services rendered by his late Majesty during that long reign of his, in which so many profound changes occurred and so many events momentous for the whole of the British Empire. In March of that same year a general committee, as representative in character as possible, was formed, and met at the Mansion House by the invitation of the Lord Mayor, to decide what should be the nature of such a memorial. At that meeting it was decided that the memorial should take two forms, namely, the erection of a statue on a suitable site and also some philanthropic scheme. Details were remitted to a sub-committee, and that sub-committee, after a very careful and exhaustive consideration of various plans and various sites, recommended to the general committee that the memorial should take the form of playing fileds for the nation, and the erection of a statue upon what was known as the Abingdon Street site, a site which was considered particularly suitable on account of its background, its position and its historic association.<p></p> That recommendation was accepted by the general committee in May of 1936; but it was recognised that it might be <span id="2052" class="column-number" data-column-number="2052"></span> found that the original site proposed, which comprised a considerable area in Abingdon Street, might prove to be too expensive if the playing fields scheme was to have adequate scope. That, as a fact, proved to be the case, and accordingly later on, in November of 2936. it was decided by the executive committee of the general committee of the fund that the site should be changed. It was brought down to a much smaller area than that which had been originally contemplated. The scheme, which was estimated to cost about £205,000, required the surrender by the Government of certain property, vested in the Office of Works, which was valued at £80,000, and, subject to the approval of Parliament, the Government stated their willingness to hand over the site free of charge for the memorial.<p></p> This scheme so curtailed did not escape criticism, because, among other things, it involved the demolition of two houses of considerable artistic merit, Numbers 6 and 7, Old Palace Yard; and in order to obtain the best advice on the subject the executive committee consulted the Royal Fine Art Commission. The Fine Art Commission recommended that the area should be still further curtailed so as to avoid the demolition of those two interesting houses, and they expressed the opinion that in the form which they recommended the site would present exceptional opportunities for a worthy setting of the memorial. The scheme now before the House is, of course, less costly than the one previously contemplated. The total cost of the scheme as it is now proposed is £125,000 and the value of the Government property comprised in it is £60,000, leaving £65,000 to be found by the fund itself.<p></p> The object of the Motion which I am now moving is to obtain the specific approval of Parliament to the proposal. If the contribution of the Government had taken the form of a cash contribution, then, of course, the approval of the House would have been implicit in their passing the Supplementary Estimate which would have been necessary for the purpose, but as no cash is involved, but merely a transfer of property, a different procedure is required. The House will be aware that, as is stated in a Treasury Minute dated the 8th of this month, Cmd. Paper 6041, the Treasury issued a Circular in 1923, which dealt with the method to be employed <span id="2053" class="column-number" data-column-number="2053"></span><blockquote><q>"where it is proposed to make a gift of public stores or property not requiring replacement, either of unusual nature or exceeding £10,000 in value, They would present to the House of Commons a Minute giving particulars of the gift and explaining the circumstances, and would not give Their assent to the gift until 14 days after the issue of the Minute, except in cases of special urgency."</q></blockquote> If that procedure had been followed literally it would have been sufficient to allow 14 days to elapse after 8th June, and the Treasury might have given their assent. They felt, as they say in the Minute, that the circumstances of this proposed gift are exceptional, and that the Lords of the Treasury <blockquote><q>"feel that the normal procedure … is not entirely appropriate"</q></blockquote> in this case, and <blockquote><q>"that the gift should be made subject to a specific affirmative Resolution of both Houses of Parliament."</q></blockquote> It is to carry out that proposal that this Motion is now brought before the House.<p></p> Of course, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there has been a good deal of controversy on the subject of the site of this Memorial, and I am aware that varying views have been expressed as to the appropriateness of the site which was decided upon, but I would make it clear, for one thing, that the Government themselves have taken no part in the decision upon the site: that was left entirely to the National Memorial Fund Committee. I think that it will be agreed that the Executive Committee, which has been so long engaged in trying to carry out the wishes of the contributors to the fund, have taken account of all considerations which have to be borne in mind in a matter of this kind, and I think the House will desire this afternoon to record a unanimous vote approving what will, I am sure, be a worthy Memorial to a King for whose personal character and public services all of us must ever retain the deepest respect and gratitude.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">On these occasions of memorials, questions of great controversy are always raised. The site is never right or the statue is never right. It is impossible to satisfy everybody, but at this stage in the development of the <span id="2054" class="column-number" data-column-number="2054"></span> scheme it is impossible for anybody to take serious objection. There may be some of us who would have preferred a different scheme, but I feel that it is peculiarly appropriate that, as his late Majesty was bound by close ties to a rapidly changing Parliament which saw the party with which I am associated grow in numbers, he should have a Memorial as close to the precincts of the Houses of Parliament as possible. I can say for myself and my friends that we hope only that the Memorial will be worthy of the building in which we work and worthy of a life which was spent in the public service.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I rise on behalf of my friends and myself to support the Motion before the House. Previous speakers have referred to controversy about the site of the Memorial; at any rate, there is no controversy, I am sure, in this House or in the country about the necessity for such a Memorial, in addition to the very valuable Memorials which are being raised to the memory of King George V in the King George V Fields which are springing up all over the country. We are prepared, for our part, to accept the decision of the National Memorial Fund Committee on the question of the site. We believe that their labours will result in a Memorial which will be worthy of London and also of a King, whose qualities as a constitutional Ruler, and whose character as a man, will be held in everlasting veneration and affection by the British people.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">
