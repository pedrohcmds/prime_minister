<p class="">I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<p></p> Last February, a Motion was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall) that this House approved of the recommendation of the Departmental Committee upon Members' pensions and favoured the initiation of legislation to carry those recommendations into effect. That Motion was carried by a substantial majority— a larger majority than that which has just been obtained on the Third Reading of the Finance Bill. As Leader of the House, I felt it to be my duty to carry out the intention of the House by introducing a Bill. Accordingly, I now move the Second Reading of this Bill. The Motion to which I have just referred was subjected to a free vote of the House, and the same procedure will be adopted to-night. I want to take the opportunity of repeating on this occasion assurances which I gave to hon. Members who are supporters of the Government and who may take a different view from that which I am going to put to the House, that no reproach will be levelled against them or any resentment felt against them, if they express their disagreement. I regard this matter, not as one of public policy, but as a domestic issue among the Members of this House. The Bill raises no new point of a general character. The arguments for and against the Second Reading of the Bill, I think, are just the same as <span id="2510" class="column-number" data-column-number="2510"></span> those that were used for or against the approval of my hon. and gallant Friend's Resolution, and, therefore, I do not think it is necessary for me to go over the old ground again or indeed to take up much of the time of the House, but there are one or two points on which I should like to say a word or two.<p></p> First of all, there was a general feeling that there should be no charge upon public funds in respect of the provisions contained in this Bill, and some concern was expressed lest, not a direct, but an indirect charge might accrue in consequence of the fact that the statutory deduction which is to be made from Members' salaries might be set off against liability to Income Tax. Under existing legislation, I think there is little doubt that that would be the result, that this statutory deduction could be set off against liability to Income Tax and Surtax. But to meet that we have introduced a special provision in the Bill, in Subsection (4) of Clause 1, which expressly provides that this statutory deduction shall not be allowable as a set-off against Income Tax. That, therefore, makes it absolutely clear that the provisions of the Bill involve no charge at all, direct or indirect, upon public funds, and, that being so, it is, as I said, clear that no question of public policy is here involved. Nobody can say that hon. Members, in voting for this Bill, are voting for some advantage to themselves at the expense of the taxpayer. The taxpayer is really not concerned in this Bill at all. It is a purely private or domestic arrangement, as I have described it, under which Members themselves will, if the Bill becomes law, contribute a fixed amount out of their salaries for the purposes which are set forth in the Bill.<p></p><span id="2511" class="column-number" data-column-number="2511"></span> The only reason for bringing in a Bill at all, apart from the question of Income Tax, to which I have already referred, is the necessity for making the deduction from Members' salaries compulsory. I know that some of my hon. Friends would have much preferred that it should not be compulsory but voluntary; but the report of the Departmental Committee, in paragraph 12, on page 8, points out the reason why it seemed to them, as it also seems to me, to be essential, for the purposes of this scheme that the deduction should be statutory and compulsory and should not be left to the individual wishes of hon. Members. The Departmental Committee said: <blockquote><q>"Apart therefore from any other objection which might be felt to reliance on optional contributions, the necessity of assuring to the management of the fund a known and permanent income over an indefinite period points, as a practical measure, to placing a statutory obligation on all Members of the House of Commons to contribute to the fund."</q></blockquote> On the question as to whether Members would have preferred to have this deduction voluntary or statutory, there may be differences of opinion. I should have thought there was something to be said for the point of view that it is really less embarrassing to have a definite amount fixed by Statute and applicable to everybody than to leave it to individual Members to consider whether they can find reasons why they should give more or less than somebody else, and always to be uneasy lest somebody else might be making a contribution in comparison with which their own might not seem to be adequate or appropriate. I know that my own feeling would be that I would much rather have the amount fixed by Statute. But I think the overwhelming reason is that which is pointed out by the Departmental Committee, that unless you know for certain what the income of the fund is going to be, you make the task of the trustees who have to administer it almost impossible. It seems to me that in such circumstances you might find that the fund would work out in such a way that when the trustees had fixed an annuity for a particular individual on certain assumptions as to the income of the fund, and subsequently, for one reason or another, the fund did not reach the amount which they had expected, they would then have to reduce the <span id="2512" class="column-number" data-column-number="2512"></span> annuity which had already been granted. It is quite certain that the possibility of a reduction in the amount already given to a particular individual would destroy his sense of security, and, I should suppose, would therefore destroy to a great extent the value of the help which would be given.<p></p> I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Central Leeds (Mr. Denman) is troubled in his mind because a statutory deduction is to be made from a non-statutory salary. I can understand that there may be a number of objections to this scheme, some of which, at any rate, may seem to be very forcible to those who hold them, but I cannot think that my hon. Friend's objection is a very real one. Indeed, it seems to me to be somewhat pedantic. Nobody surely can be in any serious doubt as to the permanence of Members' salaries, which have now been in existence for 28 years, and, although they have suffered some alteration, are still payable. I would point out to my hon. Friend, as indeed, I am sure, must already have been in his mind, that no new principle will be introduced by this statutory deduction from a non-statutory salary. Income Tax is a statutory deduction, and, so far as I am aware, nobody has yet been troubled by any doubt as to the propriety of allowing salaries still to be merely voted instead of being fixed by Statute on that account.<p></p> Another point that I would like to make in connection with the Bill is in regard to its Title and the nature of the provision which it makes. The report of the Departmental Committee is described as a report on "pensions for Members of the House of Commons," but this Bill is not a pensions Bill. It is a House of Commons Members Fund Bill, and hon. Members will see, if they look through the Bill, that the word "pension" nowhere occurs in it, except in allusion to pensions under the Ministers of the Crown Act, and in fact in the provision for the payment which is prescribed in Sub-section (2) of Clause 1 there is nothing about pensions. What it speaks of is the power of the trustees to make out of the fund periodical or other payments. Therefore, that may cover specific grants as well as periodical payments. In fact this is not really a pensions Bill, and it would be quite inappropriate to compare what we are doing here with any <span id="2513" class="column-number" data-column-number="2513"></span> pension scheme which is in force in the Civil Service or in any other institution. What we are doing here is to provide a fund which is to be raised by contributions from hon. Members from which payments can be made in certain circumstances to certain individuals by trustees appointed by the House, to whom wide discretionary powers are given, but those discretionary powers are not described as powers to grant pensions, but merely as powers to make either periodic or other kinds of payments.<p></p> The Bill follows the recommendations of the Departmental Committee except in two particulars. One of them is the provision which maintains the£12 deduction as being liable to Income Tax, and the other is to be found in the First Schedule, where some departure has been made from the recommendations of the Committee, in that the Bill provides that£75 of private income in the case of an ex-Member or£50 of private income in the case of an ex-Member's widow is to be disregarded in considering the limit of the amount which may be paid out by way of periodic payment to any beneficiary. Otherwise the Bill is in strict accord with the recommendations of the Departmental Committee.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Yes,£75 a year. Therefore, if a man has£75 a year, he may still get, in addition to that,£150 if the trustees decide that that is the amount which should be paid to him, and similarly with regard to the widow, only in her case it would be£50 and not£75. I am not going to enter into arguments against the views of those who would take objection to the proposals in this Bill. I respect those who have objections of a substantial kind, and I recognise that this is a matter on which there may very well be differences of opinion, but for myself I still feel, as I did last February, that underlying the political differences between various sections of this House there is something which we all have in common, and that is a regard for the House as a corporate body and as part of the constitution of this country. And so the thought that we can ensure by the provisions of this Bill that, so far as funds will permit, a fellow-Member whose voice and face have long been familiar to us shall not, when <span id="2514" class="column-number" data-column-number="2514"></span> he leaves this House, be reduced to poverty because he is too old or too infirm to support himself—that thought makes a strong appeal to me. It appeals to me not only because it is in accord with our common feelings of humanity, which, I think, are always most pained by the distress of those with whom we have come into close contact in the course of our lives, but also from the conviction that the provisions we are making in this Bill will, when they become law, strengthen the attachment of future Members to this House and will increase the respect which it already enjoys.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The lines of cleavage in regard to this Bill do not follow the ordinary party lines,and, therefore, I do not speak as the representative of the party, but I would say to the House that my hon. Friends behind me support this Bill, and, indeed, will welcome it. The Prime Minister has moved the Second Reading in a very brief speech, and in that I will try to imitate him, but I would take this opportunity of saying to him that I appreciate and very greatly respect the motives which have led him to recommend this Measure to the House. Frankly, he has not followed the line of least resistance. After all, we know that it must have meant a certain amount of embarrassment to him as Leader of a party, but he has thought it was the right thing to do, and has felt that in the circumstances he had a major obligation as Leader of the House. I support this Bill because it seems to me to be a sensible and a natural proposal at the stage which this House has now reached. It seems to be a piece of inspired common sense, such as this House does show at the right moment, as it always has done for centuries. The fact is that this House now expects that about one-third of its Members shall be able to give the whole of their time to this House from 11 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock at night, and our work could not be carried on in Standing Committees if they were not there, and we should not be able to do it if it were not that there is in the House now a new representative type of Member who has no resources outside the House. Such Members are found on both sides of the House.<p></p> When it was decided to increase the salary of Members to£600 a year it was <span id="2515" class="column-number" data-column-number="2515"></span> because of that change in our composition and because the House took the view that every Member of Parliament ought to be secure of, at any rate, the primary needs of life. To make provision for your old age and provision for your wile if you die is a primary need of life, and although the salary has been increased to£600 a year, nevertheless that primary need cannot be provided out of that salary. Most Members come here when they are about 40 years of age—not much before—and no insurance company will give a Member, under any contribution he can make, a provision which would cover a pension in his old age. It cannot be done. Therefore, we come back to the fact that if this provision is to be made at all the only way is by a fund like this, to which we all make a small contribution.<p></p> The Prime Minister knows the hardness of life for a number of Members' here. He has not referred to it, but he knows it. He has information which tells him. I shall not enter into individual cases, but every Member who has inquired knows that Members have lost their seats after they are 60 years old and have bitterly regretted that ours is not an insured occupation, because they would gladly have accepted unemployment benefit. There have been other Members who have died in harness, and there has been some sort of collection for the widow, and the matter has come to an end. If Members are thinking of what is right for the dignity of this House I say that that spectacle is a far greater slur upon the dignity and the self-respect of the House than the establishment of a fund to which we all contribute on equal terms. Let me say this to hon. Members who may not know the full facts. It is sometimes thought of Members on this side that most of them get pensions from their trade unions, and that by the provision we propose here the trade unions will be freed from that obligation. I have made careful inquiries and the facts are that not 20 per cent. of the Members on this side have a pension from a trade union, co-operative society or any other organisation.<p></p> The Prime Minister has seen the argument against this Bill, and I can see it too. I can understand a Member saying," Why should I want to provide pensions for Members who have been all their lives opposing what I want to see done? <span id="2516" class="column-number" data-column-number="2516"></span> [Hon. Members: "No"] Well, that seems to me a natural reaction. [Hon. Members: "Nothing to do with it"] Then I will come to the Prime Minister's view. I think he was right in saying that this House is, above all else, a corporate body, and I believe that the country appreciates us most when we act as a corporate body, as we did during the Abdication and as we may have to do in the immediate future. I believe that is our secret, and I notice that other Parliaments which looked like ours never learnt the secret—and where are they? If we are a corporate body I would point out that every corporate body in the land nowadays regards it as its duty to see that its members shall not end their lives in indignities and penury, and I believe it will be found that this Bill will strengthen this House as a national institution.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">In the absence of my right hon. Friend who would have liked to be here to support the Prime Minister I want to associate myself and my hon. Friends with the principle of this Bill. It is not exactly a Bill of the terms and character that we originally thought desirable, but we are conscious that in the difficult circumstances of the case probably this is the only kind of Bill that is likely to get through this House. Some hon. Members have, no doubt, as I have, received very critical postcards from constituents and other people in various parts of the country criticising us for, at a time like this, giving Parliamentary time to a Bill of this character. It has been suggested, and suggested perhaps with some reason, that while the problem of increasing the old age pension remains unsettled we have no right to tackle a problem of this kind, but when the country and the public realise the character of the Bill I am sure they will see that it is not an unreasonable proposal and should not take up an undue amount of time. It has been suggested, sometimes I agree by persons not too sympathetic to this institution, that it is a club, the best club in London. If that is said on the social side, of course it is a criticism that we have reason to resent, but I think we can accept it that the House of Commons has the club spirit, that there is a corporate feeling that membership of this House engenders, and that we like to feel that we belong to an institution which puts upon all of us common obligations.<p></p><span id="2517" class="column-number" data-column-number="2517"></span> I suggest that that is the spirit which is behind this Bill. We are standing shoulder to shoulder to help each other. The mast majority of the Members of this House will not benefit by these provisions, and that, after all, is the best argument for the Bill—that the majority are standing by the few, and that the whole House feels it to be an obligation that no Member who has served the House faithfully for a reasonable period should be put in a position of poverty. An important point was made by the right hon. Gentleman in pointing out that membership of this House deprives members of the insurance system, deprives them of the advantage of old age pensions and any other provision to which an ordinary member of the working class is entitled. In those circumstances surely this is a reasonable proposal, and I do not think any critic can say with judgment that a Bill of this kind is a waste of Parliamentary time. I believe that with the good will that most of us are prepared to show it will go through all its stages rapidly and, I hope, become an Act of Parliament before we adjourn for the Summer Recess.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I beg to move, to leave out the word "now," and, at the end of the Question, to add "upon this day three months."<p></p> I am indeed grateful, as all my hon. Friends are grateful, to the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister for his categorical assurance that this Bill will be left to a free vote of the House. Without such an assurance the suggestion that it will be a free vote would be entirely illusory. Indeed, it is to a certain extent illusory even as things are, for several of my hon. and right hon. Friends have told me that though they are entirely against the principles of this Bill nevertheless they have never voted against the Prime Minister and do not intend to do so now. However much my right hon. Friend may claim, and justly claim, that he is introducing this Bill as the Leader of the House, he is nevertheless the Leader of the party and of the Government, and that fact inevitably raises in the minds of his supporters in relation to any Bill which he may introduce the question "Love me, love my dog "I am sorry but I do not like this dog of my right hon. Friend's and, since he has been good enough to say that any of us who like <span id="2518" class="column-number" data-column-number="2518"></span> may shoot it, my hon. Friends and T intend to assassinate it to-night in the Division Lobby.<p></p> To catalogue all the objections to the Bill it would be necessary to write a book. The problem is how, within the compass of a few words, most effectively to oppose it and expose it. The ideal of Parliament is that it should freely represent the nation's opinion as it changes from time to time. Any Measure which, like this Bill, tends to give Members of Parliament or their backers a vested interest in their seats strikes at the very roots of its freely representative character. We have been striving most elaborately to convince the public, and to convince ourselves, that we are not in any sense laying any charge on the public in connection with these grants to ex-Members or their widows which may arise under the Bill. Yet why should we not lay a charge on the public? If it is a good premise that a Member of Parliament is of value to the country, and if we decide that something should be done about it, it is a public and not a private obligation that he should be. maintained in reasonable circumstances; and if we decide to do anything about this we should put a higher value upon ourselves and we should have the courage to stand on this principle.<p></p> Further, I should like to ask, why is it unseemly that an ex-Member of Parliament should be "going about on his uppers"? Because of the public position which he has held. It is, therefore, a public and not a private interest to prevent it. The question of the unsuitability of the time at which this Bill is being introduced was argued at length when the matter was before the House on a Private Member's Motion in February. The arguments mostly centred round the question whether or no it is proper that this Measure should be introduced at a time when we are telling the country that old age pensions cannot be increased. I will only add this comment. It is surely a paradox, when each of us almost every day finds himself having to write to his constituents and explain to them how this or that Measure which affects a public interest cannot be got through this Session as it would hold up the business of the State, nevertheless we seem to be able to find time to attend to things which affect our private affairs. One could easily multiply reasons. It is sufficient to say—and I say it with very great regret <span id="2519" class="column-number" data-column-number="2519"></span> about any Measure introduced by the Prime Minister—that this Measure reflects in miniature all the elements of sloppy sentimental, half-thinking which have brought the finances of democracy all over the world to their present condition. We shall have to be made of a good deal harder stuff than this before we are going to lick the Germans. The argument that it is only a comparatively small matter, and, therefore, not worth making an issue about, can only be likened to the argument of the young woman in Dean Inge's story who was called upon to account for a baby whose existence required justification, and who sought to justify it on the ground that it was only a tiny one.<p></p> There is a point I should like to make with regard to the previous Debate. Speaking on this matter last February, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said: <blockquote><q>"The scheme contemplated here, which has been worked out by the Committee with so much care, is a scheme which would begin to operate from the time when the necessary Act of Parliament was passed."</q></blockquote> I should like to emphasise the words "so much care," because the Committee which worked out this scheme did not discover that it was a pension fund. It was left to the House to discover it after the event. Later on the right hon. Gentleman said: <blockquote><q>"I have had occasion to be in close consultation with those who have drawn up the scheme and, in order to see how it worked, one naturally had a draft of the Bill prepared."— [Official Report, 2nd February, 1939; col. 463, Vol. 343]</q></blockquote> That implies that the Government, in drafting a Bill to work in concert with a scheme of the Committee, had at least exercised equal care. I hope my right hon. Friend will not mind if just there I part company with him, because I do not agree that the Government or the Committee did think this thing out with care. I think it has been done in as sloppy a way as anything that has come under my notice, and it was necessary to improve it from time to time as new light was shed on the subject. In the course of the Debate last February my hon. Friend the Member for Central Leeds (Mr. Denman), and also my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Macquisten), called attention to the question whether or not Income Tax would have to be paid on the contribution to be made by Members under the <span id="2520" class="column-number" data-column-number="2520"></span> Bill. I understood from the Prime Minister that that addition to the Bill was only made after the Debate last February. If I am right in that assumption, it is just another instance of the fact that in working out this scheme those who are responsible for it have not thought out their problems, and this very important matter was discovered only at the last moment.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">As I listened to the Prime Minister introducing the Bill, I found it a little difficult to recognise him. I was not a Member of the House two years ago when salaries were raised, and I do not know what undertakings, express or implied, were given at that time when salaries were raised that there should later be a pension scheme. But I got the impression, listening to my right hon. Friend, that he was in some sense fulfilling some sort of pledge or undertaking, because it seemed to me that this cloak—this mantle of passing legislation which is satisfactory to the party opposite does not sit naturally on the shoulders of my right hon. Friend. This fashion for catering to the political principles and personal needs of the party opposite suggests to my mind the touch of a vanished hand. [<em>Interruption</em>] I should be very glad to be enlightened further upon it because, after all, this is, as has been pointed out by my right hon. Friend, <span id="2521" class="column-number" data-column-number="2521"></span> an entirely domestic matter. There is no question of public policy involved, and, therefore, there can be no possible reason why any of us should not freely discuss among ourselves across the Floor of the House any undertakings or arrangements which may have been come to either as regards the genesis of the Bill or the time at which it is introduced.<p></p> I am reluctant to stress the fact that this Measure commands the support of the party opposite. But with great regret I feel that I must question the good judgment of my right hon. Friend in introducing at this time a Bill which seems to a large number of his supporters wholly unnecessary, and quite contrary to their political philosophy. There is one final thought with which I should like to leave the House, one governing consideration in the light of which I think it is proper that we should consider the Bill. Over the portals of a class room at my old school there were written the words: <blockquote><q>"Someone must be last, but no one need be."</q></blockquote> So it seems with the business of being a Member of Parliament; 615 persons must be Members of Parliament, but no one need be. If anyone cannot afford to become a Member he need not stand for election. If he does, I say let him have the courage to take the consequences of his own decision.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I beg to second the Amendment.<p></p> I can understand a considerable number of arguments being put forward for a pension fund for Members of Parliament being made a national charge or, on the other hand, for a benevolent scheme, but a scheme which merely consists of a compulsory benevolence appears to me to be the worst way of meeting a matter which I am prepared to admit ought to be met in some way or another. This scheme is inopportune at present, it is unwise and it is unnecessary. I do not want to go into the question of old age pensions except to say that, at whatever period or at whatever time Parliament considered <span id="2522" class="column-number" data-column-number="2522"></span> some form of pensions scheme for themselves, I should have thought, as a humble back-bencher, that the best way of getting misrepresented, the best way of making Parliament look rather foolish was to adopt such a scheme within a week of the decision that an increase of old age pensions could not be proceeded with. I know quite well that many of the arguments that may be put forward on the platform outside will be completely unfair arguments in regard to that. The ordinary person in the country does not examine with the utmost detail Parliamentary Debates in the way that persons used to do a number of years ago. If they did I am certain that the cry would go up from one end of the country to the other that hon. Members of this House can find time to look after themselves but can find no time to deal with important matters which at present are kept off, because of lack of time; or, indeed, to deal with the conditions of the poor.<p></p> In the course of his speech, the Prime Minister said that this was not a question of dealing with public funds but simply of Members of Parliament, as a corporate body, dealing with their own money. I rather wonder. Two years ago, without getting any particular mandate for so doing, we raised our salaries from£400 to£600. Does any hon. Member here really imagine that unless we had granted ourselves that increase, this scheme for pensions would have been brought before the House? At that time, most painful pictures were painted to show that those who then had£400 a year were unable to exist upon it with any comfort. No Government would then have proposed to make a further deduction of£12 from the salary of those already wretched people in order to provide pensions. The present Measure arises from the Measure which was passed in that Parliament, and therefore it arises from an indirect charge upon the public purse.<p></p> Something rather curious which arises is that, under this scheme, all of us will pay Income Tax on the full£600, including the£12 which is to be set aside for our future benefit. I suppose that every scheme which pretends even mildly to be insurance receives money upon which Income Tax has been paid, and then any money which is set aside for some purpose is usually because of some <span id="2523" class="column-number" data-column-number="2523"></span> ascertainable gain. Under this scheme very few people would seriously say that there is any ascertainable gain from this£12, on which people will have paid Income Tax and which is to be set aside simply for their future benefit and to be used at some future time. If any scheme of this character were passed through the House that the money is to have Income Tax paid upon it, persons who at any time depart from the House ought to get some benefit from it, means test or no means test.<p></p> Then we come to a further point. If we accept the scheme on the lines laid down in the Bill it will be, of course, a subsidising of the safe seat by the unsafe seat. Except in very special circumstances the ordinary beneficiary of this scheme must have reached the age of 60 years and must have served for 10 years in Parliament. I am not at all sure that the people with the unsafe seat can be sure of 10 years in the House, or that the people who can be assured of 10 years here are the best Members in this House. There are safe seats on the side of the House on which I sit. Some of them are represented by men without great means, but whose ability or enthusiasm has persuaded their constituencies to adopt them. The vast majority of the safe seats on this side of the House are represented by men with considerable private means. It is a pity it should be so, but it is.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">On both sides of the House there are seats for which we can rely upon the constituencies to send back Members of our particular colour. On the Opposition side of the House are many industrial seats represented by trade unionists. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith) used in his speech the figure of 20 per cent. I do not know whether he meant it to be taken in that way, but I want to get it right. I suppose that one can assume that somewhere about 50 per cent., and perhaps a little over, of hon. Members on the other side represent trade-union seats. If something under 20 per cent. of hon. Members opposite get pensions, what is the argument? In regard to hardship when they retire, I do not think that hon. Members who sit for trade-union seats do at all badly.<p></p><span id="2524" class="column-number" data-column-number="2524"></span> Quite the contrary; but I am only dealing with what the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Keighley said. There are cases of old servants of the trade unions. They have represented their unions and done a considerable amount of good in the country and in Parliament. In those comparatively few cases I do not believe that the great trade unions would allow their best servants to fall into starvation. If they did, it would be the worst argument I have ever heard against the great trade-union system.<p></p> The right hon. Gentleman also said that there was more dignity in Members of Parliament having a scheme of this sort and coming before the trustees set up in the Bill than for them to appeal to their own party for support. Is there anything unfair in a man who has fallen on hard times in his old age, to whatever party he belongs, saying: "I have served you honourably and well, and you know it. I am in a difficulty. Will you give me a hand" There does not seem anything undignified in that. It seems better than having to submit to a means test before a number of trustees, some of whom may be completely unknown to the applicant, for assistance from funds given by persons in the House of Commons and compulsorily deducted from those per-sons, many of whom may be completely unknown to the applicant himself. If it is a question of dignity, it seems to me that many of us would rather go to the people we have served than to a compulsory charitable fund administered by people whom we had not of necessity particularly served.<p></p> I have been assuming that something has to be done, and the very fact that this matter has been discussed, both in February and again to-night, has indicated some need for provision in the case of men of broken life or bad health. That ought to make it possible, and, indeed, easy, for a voluntary scheme to be run by the party concerned. I do not mean simply by parties in Parliament. The Prime Minister made a certain amount of play about that. He suggested that it would be absurd to have a scheme in this House by which Members of the House were voluntarily to decide how much they would put into the common fund in any particular year. I agree that, if the matter is carried out by the House itself, it ought to be a compulsory scheme, but my view is that it is not simply a question <span id="2525" class="column-number" data-column-number="2525"></span> for this House. As far as we are concerned, the membership of Parliament is far more important outside this House than it is in this House merely as a corporate body. As far as we are concerned, membership of this House is a matter of pride, and teaches us to learn a great deal about other people on all sides, but our real importance is not here, but outside. It ought to be possible to have a voluntary scheme run by the parties themselves outside, which could deal with any hard case if such should arise. I feel that it is almost unthinkable, in view of the discussions we have had on this subject, that it would be impossible to have a scheme of that character if we worked at it. After this Measure is defeated, as I hope it will be, the result of the discussion would inevitably be considered by those who drafted such a scheme.<p></p> Supposing that the voluntary scheme were unsuccessful—I think it would be successful—that would be a strong argument in favour of a national scheme. I can visualise conditions arising under the present Bill in which a sentimental appeal would be raised in the constituencies. If a Member who had represented a constituency for seven, eight or nine years was getting on in life, there might, at a time when some great national issue was involved, be a sentimental appeal, "Vote for dear old Bill just once more, and then he will get his pension" It does not seem to me that a sentimental appeal of that kind would add much to the dignity of Parliament or to the efficiency of Parliament if, when men are in poor health, or aged, or otherwise unfit for the life of Parliament, they are to be, so to speak, held up and kept going somehow in order that poor old Bill may get his pension. It would be far better to face the thing frankly and honestly and come along in a year or two and say that the attempt to establish a voluntary scheme has failed. The efficiency of Parliament is more important to the nation than it is to Parliament itself, and if it is not possible under benevolence to make some serious and successful effort to meet the needs of such people, you can then come to the State and say, "Why not provide an extra£25 or£50 which can be applied to provide this subsidy for pension needs? "thereby making it," if the necessity should arise, a truly national scheme.<p></p> I agree with my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment that this scheme <span id="2526" class="column-number" data-column-number="2526"></span> is a snobbish scheme. I believe, as I said at the start, that this matter could be met by the private benevolence of parties or, if necessary, by the State, but the scheme in its present form of compulsory benevolence is neither fish, flesh, fowl nor good red herring. It contains the vices of both the other possible schemes and the virtues of neither, and I sincerely hope that it will be heavily defeated.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">As this Bill is based on a Resolution which I moved in February, I want to say a few words with regard to the Bill this evening. I am not going to speak at any length, because I gave in February what seemed to me to be strong reasons for the introduction of the Measure we are now discussing. I have heard a great deal about this Measure during the last five months from my friends, not all of them very appreciative of the Resolution I moved. That is only natural, and I do not in the least complain about it. When I spoke in February I gave my reasons for the proposal, and I have noted a few points based on objections which have been raised to the Bill, with which I propose now to deal. My hon. Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) said he could write a book about his objections to the Bill. I venture to say that I could produce a much better book with my answers to his objections, and I think that possibly a few selections from it might be of interest to the House. I have not seen my hon. Friend's book, but I cannot help thinking that some of his suggestions were possibly not very happily chosen.<p></p> It is easy to say that this is entirely a non-party matter. In a sense it is, but in a sense it is not, because, although a certain number of those who sat with me in the past might have been glad of the benefits of a Measure of this sort, I think it is generally admitted that this Measure would possibly benefit one portion of the House more than another. Some of my political friends—not friends, incidentally, all of them, in this matter— have asked why those who require assistance cannot be left to be given assistance by their societies or trade unions. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith) dealt quite fully and frankly with this point in <span id="2527" class="column-number" data-column-number="2527"></span> February, and he has again mentioned this evening how inquiries he has made from, I gather, the whole of his friends— not only those interested in trade unions— over 200 strong, I think I am right in saying, have indicated that less than one-fifth would have been able to fall back on funds such as those I have just mentioned. That leaves a very appreciable number, apart from those on my side of the House, and apart possibly from those who are Liberals—I know of one former Liberal Member who is in distress. Four-fifths of an appreciable party in the House—which in the years to come may either wax or wane—would have no outside help. I must say that I was delighted to hear that.<p></p> Most of us would agree that the fewer the number of people in this House who are dependent on organisations outside, whether of employers or employés, the better it is for the House. If it is the case that a number of Members are in the position that they have to think, "If I give a vote as I want to do it might, at the end of my time in this House, be borne against me by the organisation with which I am connected," that is a strong argument for a Measure of this sort. Quite obviously, the more the House can assure the independence of a Member, not only while he is here but when he leaves the House, the better it will be.<p></p> The point has been raised about this being a compulsory deduction. Quite frankly, I would very much have preferred that this Measure had not been compulsory at all. But, after all, we have had old age pensions for 30 years. This is not a new principle. Both the trades that I have been connected with during my life have schemes for the benefit of those who may fall by the wayside. This House has lagged very much behind in this matter. It is late in the day now to say, "Let us see whether we can get the money voluntarily." If there had been a fund in existence, this Bill would not have had to be brought in. The fact that old age pensions were first brought in by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) as far back as 1908 and that nothing has been done to provide pensions for Members of this House, is something in the nature of a slur upon the corporate spirit of the House of Commons. I will read <span id="2528" class="column-number" data-column-number="2528"></span> one extract from the Report of the Departmental Committee: <blockquote><q>"It is found that in a certain number of cases a Member who has spent many years in Parliament is unable after the cessation of his Parliamentary salary to support himself in the most modest manner which comports with the dignity of that Institution."</q></blockquote> That, to my mind, is a convincing argument. In view of that statement, made as the result of inquiry by dispassionate civil servants, I think the necessity for such a Measure as this is clear. I do not want to mention any names, but it is common knowledge that the widow of one who was a much respected member of our body in February, and who has passed. away since then, has been left in very difficult circumstances. That that should have happened since last February must show anybody who had doubts in February about this Measure the need that exists for something to be done. A pension of£75 a year would have been of great assistance in such a case.<p></p> Other hon. Members have come to me and said, "Why are you taking£12 a year from me?" I think I may claim some credit for the decision to increase Members' salaries, and I cannot help saying to these people, "Do you not remember that, largely by my efforts, your salary was increased two years ago by£200 a year?" I also point out that, although I do not regard that£200 as unearned increment—because I believe that those of us who do our jobs here richly deserve our£600 a year—this is an unexpected windfall; and if they receive£188 a year extra instead of£200 a year extra I do not see that they have much to complain about or to attack me about. Then, this scheme has been described as sloppy. It was my privilege to give evidence, like certain other hon. Members, before the Committee. So far from the scheme being sloppy, every point that Is found in the Bill will be found in the report, with the exception of the point mentioned by the Prime Minister, which I think I raised originally and which was suggested by others also, that small private savings should not be counted against the individual. I am delighted that that has been provided for in the Bill.<p></p> The hon. Member for Hastings raised the question of an indirect charge upon the taxpayer. My own view is that in <span id="2529" class="column-number" data-column-number="2529"></span> these matters the mother of Parliament should emulate Caesar's wife and be above suspicion in every way. That is no doubt the view of the Government. We have taken care always to be above suspicion in the public view. On the question of railway fares, it took years to get provision made here, although it was done in the Dominion Parliaments. Salaries were increased to£600 only two years ago. It took the greatest possible pressure on Ministers to get them to put their salaries up. When it is said that there is an indirect charge on the revenue because of loss of Income Tax, I would point out that£7,500 is the total of the fund; deduct from that one-fifth, which is the earned income allowance—and to which I think all of us here are entitled—and that brings the figure to 6,000. Income Tax on that, at 5s. 6d. in the£, amounts to just over£1,500 a year. Our total Income Tax receipts are well over£300,000,000, so this is less than 1/200,000th part of our total receipts. The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned only to-day that our payments this year amount to£1,400,000,000, so this is just over one-millionth part of the total sum. I would go back to my schoolboy days, and recall a Latin tag, <em>de minimis non curat lex</em>. I might translate that rather freely, "For such a twopenny-halfpenny detail, the Chancellor of the Exchequer need not worry." I will not demur if, under this Measure, each Member of Parliament will have to pay about££2 10s. more in Income Tax than he would otherwise have had to do. That will do away with the argument that this is even an indirect charge upon the taxpayer.<p></p> The hon. Member for South-East Essex (Mr. Raikes) used the phrase, "We shall hear about this from one end of the land to the other." On that, I would say that I represent the largest electorate in London, numbering 94,000. Of those 94,000, one elector took the trouble to write to me about this, and he was under the impression that we were putting the charge for these pensions on the Revenue. I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Essex need be very anxious about the repercussions in the country with regard to this matter. Quite frankly, I do not think that the people in the country are sufficiently interested. This is a right and proper Measure and one we ought to have adopted long <span id="2530" class="column-number" data-column-number="2530"></span> before, and it will, if carried, do a good deal to bring together the House in these difficult days, and I have pleasure in supporting it.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I do not propose to go into the merits of this Bill as they have been advanced and rejected in the Debate hitherto, but I am driven to refer to some pleasant comments made by the Prime Minister upon the Amendment that is on the Paper in my name. He observed that he thought my objection was pedantic. I had to reflect that he was speaking as Prime Minister and Leader of the House and, perhaps, had hardly had time in his busy life to remember that he is the First Lord of the Treasury. Perhaps before I have finished he will recall that fact, and realise that my objection to the immediate procedure with this Bill is by no means pedantic. The Amendment I have put down is not to reject the Bill, but to postpone it until the payment of our salaries has been put on a proper statutory basis, and that is the single point I want to urge upon the House to-night. I accept the statement of the Prime Minister that there is no charge on public funds as being practically accurate, though I do not think that he would maintain that it was strictly accurate. There is a very curious provision whereby, in the case of a Member who does not draw his salary, the deduction has to be provided from another source, and that can only be from public funds. I take it that in the cases where Members are not drawing their full salaries, they will very probably add on to the amount they take a sum sufficient to replace this£12. So there will be just some slight addition to the charge on public funds, but I should not be inclined to put it at over£100 in all. Therefore, I freely accept the statement of the Prime Minister that there is no appreciable charge on public funds.<p></p> But to revert to the point that we should not proceed with this Bill until we also place our salaries on a statutory basis, I put it strongly to the House that our present procedure is not a permanent arrangement, and we should not pass this Bill until both salaries and deductions are together authorised by statute. It is very odd that few people seem to realise the procedure that we have adopted in paying ourselves our salaries. They seem <span id="2531" class="column-number" data-column-number="2531"></span> to think that there is statutory authority for it. They forget that the procedure is that every year an Estimate is presented to us which we never discuss. We pass that Estimate without any criticism or examination, and alter the sums have been included in the Appropriation Act the money has to be paid out to us.<p></p> I ask the House to contrast the procedure by which we pay ourselves our own salaries with the procedure we adopt when we desire to confer any benefits upon our constituents. We know the ordinary procedure should we want to increase old age pensions, for example. We have a Financial Resolution with a Committee and a Report stage, and then a Bill which requires the First Reading, a Second Reading, Committee and Report stages, and the Third Reading. We present, in the face of any benefit that we desire to give, an elaboration of procedure that is almost a barbed-wire entanglement. When our constituents want to put their hands into the till they are confronted with difficulties of that kind, but when we put our hands into the till, it is "roses, roses all the way." [<em>Interruption</em>] The till is the public funds, the Exchequer of the country. Surely the till is that place from which salaries are normally drawn, and when we draw our salaries we approach the till by means of the procedure which is ludicrously simple, as we hardly ever discuss the Estimate.<p></p> Every consideration of prudence, even of common honesty, should make us even more particular about the procedure by which we pay ourselves than we are about the procedure by which we confer benefits upon others, and, so far from that being the case, it is exactly the reverse. Moreover, in the case of Ministers, we do not adopt that simple procedure in order to pay them their salaries. Their salaries have a statutory basis, and we ought to put our own salaries on a proper statutory basis, so that we cannot, in a brief half-day's sitting, add 50 per cent. to our salaries. Is that a pedantic point? It is a point that we all have firmly in our memory as having, in fact, arisen. I am not going to discuss the merits of the increase of salaries which was made a couple of years ago. I agree that£400 a year is too small, though I should pre- <span id="2532" class="column-number" data-column-number="2532"></span> fer other methods and slightly different timing, and I do not think that£600 is too much for us, but the procedure then adopted of a half-day's sitting, with a Debate which was really very inadequate, by comparison with the procedure that we adopt in regard to our constituents is not creditable to the House, and it ought not to be permitted.<p></p> I really must remind hon. Friends behind me that that is the historic and orthodox view of the Conservative party. It is not a new question. We had it up in 1911 when the Liberal Government started this method of Estimate and Appropriation Act. I supported it, but the Conservative party took precisely the reverse view. The right hon. Member for Aldershot (Viscount Wolmer) moved that the House ought to proceed by means of an Act, and that the salaries should not be on this procedure of Estimate and Appropriation. He advanced a great variety of arguments, two of which, I thought rather supported my view in voting for the Government of the day. He argued that the procedure we were then adopting could not be permanent, and that we must ultimately place the provision of salaries on the Statute Book. He also pointed out that the reason why the Liberal party were adopting that procedure was that they knew perfectly well that if they proceeded by statute the Lords would throw it out. That seemed to me an excellent reason for not at that time proceeding by statute. These conditions have gone. These excuses no longer remain, and I believe the Conservative party were fundamentally right that in normal times our salary system should be upon a statutory basis. I looked up the Division List and I found a number of names of persons who, I suppose, I must now describe as Conservative pedants. They included Austen Chamberlain, Samuel Hoare, J. Gilmour, Tryon, Hugh Cecil, Page Croft and such orthodox leaders of the Conservative party.<p></p> I am not going to Test my case finally upon the view of the Conservative party, because that does not carry with me the weight that it does with some other hon. Members, but we have had this subject under consideration since then at the Public Accounts Committee. I often regret the absence on the Front Opposition Bench of the familiar figure of Morgan Jones. I wish he were here now. He <span id="2533" class="column-number" data-column-number="2533"></span> was our chairman on the Public Accounts Committee when we had this subject before us, and he took a special interest in it. There was a great variety of cases before us, with which I need not trouble the House, cases in which the Departments had obtained money by means of estimate, without proper statutory authority. We reported on them, and I want to read to the House the report of the Public Accounts Committee, not only on the particular cases but on the general proposition, because we had to consider what is the reasonable limit of this procedure of obtaining money by estimate. We were unanimously of opinion that it was a right that must be most carefully preserved, but at the same time we recognised that it was a method that should be strictly limited and reasonably controlled, unless there was to be great danger of irresponsible expenditure by the Executive and the House of Commons. Let me quote from the Committee: <blockquote><q>"Your Committee considered also, as a matter of general principle, that where it is desired that continuing functions should be exercised by a Government Department, particularly where such functions may involve financial liability extending beyond a given financial year, it is proper, subject to certain recognised exceptions, that the powers and duties to be exercised should be defined by specific Statute."</q></blockquote> That is to say, that where the Treasury is paying out year after year sums of money to the House of Commons there should be a statutory basis for it. On that report, the Treasury made a minute. Their Lordships introduced a very elaborate minute, from which I will quote a few relevant sentences: <blockquote><q>"Nevertheless, while they think that the Executive Government must continue to be allowed a certain measure of discretion in asking Parliament to exercise power which undoubtedly belongs to it, they agree that the practice should normally accord with the view expressed by the committee, that where it is desired that continuing functions should be exercised by Government Departments, particularly where that function involves financial responsibility extending beyond a given year, it is proper that the powers and duties exercised should be defined by specific Statute. Their Lordships will for their part continue to aim at the observance of this principle."</q></blockquote> Therefore, they did not regard it as pedantic.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. Member's rising is quite irrelevant. I was going to point out that if we pass this Bill we are authorising the present method of payment of Parliamentary salaries, and maing it a perpetuity. The one way of getting back to the right track is to postpone this Measure until we also put Parliamentary salaries on a satisfactory basis. If the two Front Benches, who are so friendly, would agree to bring in a consolidating Bill, which would combine this present Bill with the existing practice in regard to the payment of salaries, and produce an agreed Measure that would place our whole salary system upon a proper statutory basis, I should be glad to vote for it, but it is because I consider that the course we are taking in this Bill is the wrong one that I put down my Amendment. We ought not to leave ourselves open to the charge, that we measure in different scales the procedures to be adopted in giving benefits to our constituents and benefits to ourselves. It is because I feel this matter strongly, that I oppose the Bill. 9.2 p.m.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The speech of the hon. Member for Central Leeds (Mr. Denman) has raised an interesting point of procedure—at least, I suppose it is an interesting point—but I must confess that I have never been able to raise much enthusiasm for a subject of such nicety as he obviously has displayed. Therefore, he will not mind if I do not follow him into the ramifications in which he has been indulging this evening. I should like to remind him of one statement he made, that in a properly conducted business people paid their wages out of the till. I have always thought and believed that those who were caught pinching from the till went to "jug" I am glad, however, that the hon. Member supports the principle of the Bill, and I hope that we shall have his vote in the Lobby. I should hate, and I am sure that the hon. Member would hate, to think that some really deserving case could not receive the attention that it would otherwise have received because the hon. Member had raised this complicated point of procedure and had thereby delayed the introduction of this Bill.<p></p> The hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson), who moved the rejection of the Bill, was not happy in his <span id="2535" class="column-number" data-column-number="2535"></span> allusions. He ventured to lecture the Members of this House on the proper way in which they should regard their business. He has been in this House two years. The hon. Member was at Eton. If when he had been at Eton for less than two years he had undertaken to lecture the senior boys of that school upon the rights and privileges of young Etonians—incidentally, I do not think much of that school and I hope they will be beaten later this week at cricket—I have no doubt that he would have been summarily treated. I hope, too, that his Amendment for the rejection of the Bill will be summarily dealt with by the House.<p></p> He did make one point which the hon. Member for South-East Essex (Mr. Raikes) took up, when he said that the scheme was half-baked and ill-conceived. All I can say is that it was considered by men who are acknowledged as absolutely at the top of the tree in these matters. It was exhaustively considered by the Committee and except for two minor points their recommendations are being followed. I have always been taught to believe that if one wanted to succeed in life one ought not only to find out the very best advice but when one had got the advice, to follow it. I think we should do so on this occasion. I was rather touched by the sad story which the hon. Member for South-East Essex told about Old Bill, but I thought it was somewhat irrelevant. I would seriously urge hon. Friends of mine to support the Bill. In every walk of life to-day when we join a corporate body we find attached to it some form of benevolent fund. If one becomes a Freemason a part of the subscription is used for a benevolent fund. A city company has a benevolent fund, and most of the trade associations, certainly the one with which I am concerned, have benevolent funds. Surely Parliament should have its own benevolent fund subscribed to and conducted by Parliament.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. and learned Member, if he wants to do so, can apply for the Chiltem Hundreds and get out of it to-morrow; there is nothing to stop him. The Patronage Secretary must accept his resignation. I know it is said that "hard cases make bad law," but this Bill seems to me to be specifically introduced to deal with the hard cases. Those who have taken an interest in this matter know that there are many hard cases which even the Mover of the Amendment would have found out if he had made inquiries. I have in mind the case of one on this side of the House and one on the Labour benches, peculiarly distressing cases, which want to be dealt with by some better method than the present method of a whip round their friends. In all seriousness I would urge my hon. Friends in all parts of the House to act generously, to consider the tragedy of some of their colleagues, and if they will do that I am sure that they will not find it in their hearts to vote against a Measure which, whatever its faults, will bring comfort, support and security to many of these tragic figures of our public life.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. McCorquodale), who has just addressed the House, has referred to Eton versus Harrow. I say, a plague on both your schools, we are now discussing Members' pensions. As regards the reply of the hon. Member to the interjection of the hon. and learned Member for Withington (Mr. Fleming), it seems to me that the suggestion that the hon. and learned Member should apply for the Chiltern Hundreds was not quite happy. If he did apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and had been 10 years in this House up to the time when he applied, and if he was of the right age and had fallen upon evil times, then by force we should have to support him although he had applied for the Chiltern Hundreds, in order to avoid being in the scheme. One thing of interest has emerged from the Debate, and that is the fact that the House now knows who is the author of the increase in the salary of hon. Members. The hon. Member for East Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall) was so influential that he was <span id="2537" class="column-number" data-column-number="2537"></span> able to extract from public funds an increase in the salary of hon. Members.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I would not for the world deprive the hon. Member of any credit for such a public-spirited and no doubt entirely disinterested action as to increase his own salary at the same time as he increased ours. The hon. Member gave the House a Latin tag. May I suggest another Latin tag: <blockquote><q>"Timeo Danaos, et dona ferentes."</q></blockquote> Beware of the Greeks when they bring gifts. The hon. Member for East Lewis-ham also mentioned the fact that he had been a witness before the committee. I spoke at some length in moving the rejection of his Motion on 2nd February, and I pointed out then, as I point out again now, that my complaint against the proceedings before the committee was that the people who gave evidence were not sufficiently representative of all parts of the House. It may be that the hon. Member for East Lewisham had an opportunity of stating his view, an opportunity which was denied, I am sorry to say, to other hon. Members who would have been glad to have been able to put their points of view. I particularly regret that I find myself in disagreement with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. I have no desire to recapitulate the arguments which I presented to the House on the 2nd February, and I do appreciate indeed the action of the Prime Minister in suggesting that the vote on this occasion as on that occasion should be an entirely free vote. I would point out, however, that the Debate on 2nd February was a very short Debate and gave no real indication of the feelings of this House, and that only 307 Members took part in the Division.<p></p> The real thing which has emerged from the introduction of this Bill is that those who opposed the Motion of the hon. Member for East Lewisham on 2nd February have been proved to be correct. We contended that however small it might be, the scheme as put forward in his Motion did involve a charge on public funds. We are glad that that point of view has received the consideration which it deserves, and that as the Bill is drawn there is no charge on public funds. However <span id="2538" class="column-number" data-column-number="2538"></span> much the hon. Member for East Lewis-ham may try to belittle the fact, he said on the 2nd February: <blockquote><q>"This scheme would involve no direct charge of any sort or kind upon the taxpayer."<span id="vol343_col" class="cross-reference" data-house-id="1" data-column-number="" data-volume-number="343">—[Official Report, 2nd February, 1939; col. 419, Vol. 343]</q></blockquote> At any rate, on this occasion he has been proved to be wrong. I am not against a pension scheme for Members of this House. I believe that no man or woman who has served the country in this honourable House should fall upon evil times through no fault of their own. I believe that the country owes it to those who have served the country here that they should be cared for if through no fault of their own bad times come upon them. I certainly think that the scheme should be a national scheme, but we know that the present moment is not the proper time for such a national scheme to be introduced. I do not think any hon. Member on either side of the House would suggest that this is a proper or suitable time to introduce a national pension scheme for hon. Members when there are so many outside this House whose miserable pittances cannot be increased because the financial circumstances of today make it impossible. Therefore, it seems to me that hon. Members must wait, as others have to wait, for an amelioration of the hardships which circumstances may force upon them. We all know that hard cases do occur, cases of hon. Members whose faces have been familiar to us who have been hard hit, cases in which in the event of the death of a Member those who are left suffer privations; and in those cases this House has always been generous. There is no hon. Member who will not put his hand in his pocket in cases of need and help by making a contribution.<p></p> But that is not the proper way in which pensions should be paid to Members of this House, or to their dependants. I cannot believe it is right that hon. Members who are in straightened circumstances should be supported by charity. It belittles the dignity of this House that the hat should have to be sent round for an hon. Member or his dependants. It belittles the dignity of the House that it should have a contributory pensions scheme which is, in fact, a forced levy upon all Members, irrespective of their private means. There might be something to be said for it if it were <span id="2539" class="column-number" data-column-number="2539"></span> graduated <em>pro rata</em>, so that those who had most should help most; but I cannot see any argument, and no argument has been made out, which would support the view that Members should receive enforced contributions from their fellows.<p></p> There is one great difficulty that I see in the scheme. I fully realise the position in which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister finds himself, and I would not do anything that would make his task more difficult and onerous, when he has so much on his shoulders. This fund, when it has been set up, will, by its nature, limit the number of persons who can be paid. When the Motion was moved on 2nd February, the suggestion was that nobody should qualify for a pension before the date of the coming into force of any legislation, but under this Bill any Member or ex-Member of the House who has the qualifications of 10 years' service and of age is eligible for a pension. There may be—I hope and trust there are not—many hard cases of ex-Members of the House at the present time, and it seems to me that, by introducing this particular scheme, you would make it quite impossible to meet the needs of all those cases. I cannot think it is right that there should be before the trustees a differentiation between the people who try to put their pitiable cases. If you are going to pension people who are in need and in difficulty, then do it without having any regard to comparisons between A, B and C. What an invidious position in which to put them and the trustees. There will be only a limited amount of funds in the pool, and the trustees will have to decide which are the most deserving cases to be paid from those funds. It seems to me that it would have been better for this scheme to have been delayed, and that it would have been infinitely preferable to have had a national pensions scheme in which the State realised and recognised its obligations to those who have served it in the House.<p></p> The hon. Baronet the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris), who represents the Liberal party—at one time he represented both of them, although now, like the Arab, he has folded his tent and silently stolen away— was presumably speaking for all those dear and absent friends who normally sit on those benches with him.<p></p><span id="2540" class="column-number" data-column-number="2540"></span> Presumably what he said is binding upon the right hon. Gentleman who leads his party, as far as anyone can bind that right hon. Gentleman. The hon. Baronet the Member for South-West Bethnal Green said that this House is a club. So it is, in the best sense of the word. One of the finest things about the House is the friendships which exist, in spite of party divisions, between hon. Members on both sides. This is the best kind of club; it is the most democratic club in the world. But I have never heard of any club which, in order to benefit its members who have fallen upon evil times, exacts a forced levy from other members. [<em>Interruption</em>]</span> The hon. Member may perhaps know of one, but I do not know of one. I have not the benefit of his vast experience.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. Member may look simple, but we know that he is not simple. I have no wish to go at length into the arguments that were made on 2nd February, when we debated this matter. Certainly, I have no wish to impede what the Prime Minister feels it to be his duty to carry out, but I owe it to myself and to the House to make clear that I do not think this is the right scheme. There should be some scheme, for the necessity of those in need is immediate, but I think it would have been better, if it had been possible, to have waited until a national scheme could be produced which would be more consonant with the dignity of the House and its great traditions.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I have listened to the whole of this Debate, but I must confess that I have not been in the slightest degree impressed by any speech that has been made from this side, except that of the hon. Member for East Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall), who moved the original Motion; and I am very glad indeed that the Prime Minister has taken up the matter. I cannot conceive that there is any hon. Member who would not be only too happy to subscribe. I believe that those who, unfortunately, through age or some other infirmity, find themselves in a bad position after they have <span id="2541" class="column-number" data-column-number="2541"></span> left the House, deserve great consideration from their friends and comrades here, and that we ought to do anything we can to help them. If any hon. Member objects to paying this contribution, he can apply for the Chiltern Hundreds, or if he does not wish to do that, he need not stand for election at the next General Election. I believe that many hon. Members who can afford to do so will subscribe to the fund in order to give it a good start. I hope that the Measure will be passed and that we shall get the subscriptions.<p></p> I do not always vote with my party, and on any occasion when I consider that a proposal from the benches opposite is essential, I vote with hon. Members opposite. It is not often that such an occasion occurs. As an example, I can mention the question of night baking. I voted against that because I do not believe that any man throughout his working life should have always to work at night. On that occasion, in the Lobby, one of my friends said, "Why did you do that? You should see our bakeries." I replied: "I do not want to see your bakeries; I should like you to see the bakeries of some other people. Besides," I said, "I do not eat new bread, so I do not see why anybody else should." I support this Bill, and I hope that, on reconsideration, many hon. Members on this side will do the same thing. I was not in the least impressed by the contention of the hon. Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) that some Clause in the Bill had been changed. Has any hon. Member ever seen a Bill which was not altered in the course of one or other stage? Such a case would be exceptional I think I have said enough to show that my feelings are all in favour of the Bill, and I hope that every hon. Member who can bring himself to do so will support it.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I feel that, after the speeches we have heard, I can begin straight away by saying that I gather that no one in this Debate has been the least impressed by any speech that has been made. I do not flatter myself that anybody will be in the least impressed by any speech that I make. The first point I would like to make is that I was rather surprised when the Prime Minister said that this scheme, which perhaps has been rather unpopular throughout the country, is now to get a new name. It <span id="2542" class="column-number" data-column-number="2542"></span> was pointed out to us that we were not now dealing with a Bill for pensions but with a House of Commons Members Fund Bill. It is, of course, based on the Departmental Committee's report with very minor differences, but that report is on Members' pensions as also was the Resolution passed in the House on 2nd February. I believe that if we are going to have it—I still hope it may be withdrawn and some better scheme put forward—do not let us run away from the name and dress it up and pretend that it is something different in order that we may be able to tell people outside that we are not proposing pensions for Members, but that this is something quite different. It is the same thing, and why hide it up?<p></p> The hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. McCorquodale) in a moving speech impressed me very much by one thing he said. He urged us to act generously. Throughout this Debate, as in the debate on 2nd February, hon. Members in different parts of the House got up and explained extremely generously that they themselves were willing to give£<em>12</em>. I would not object nearly so much to this scheme if it were passed for the duration of one Parliament, but what I feel is that we are definitely staging that in the future the salaries of Members of Parliament shall be£588. It is not merely our generosity. We are being generous at the expense of people who are coming after us and other Members. I am interested in this point because in the Debate that took place when salaries were raised to£600 it was pointed out that£400 was not enough for an hon. Member in this House with perhaps a wife and family who had the expense of living in London during the week and going back to a constituency at the week-end. It was pointed out that while hon. Members were working in this House for the sake of the country they should not be hampered by the worry and anxiety of insufficient pay. On that occasion we were given no exact figures, but no reasons have been given as to why£<em>12</em> off that salary would not mean hardship. I do not see how we can have it both ways. If it was necessary to raise it to£600, why should we remove the£12 now?<p></p> The Prime Minister in introducing this Bill pointed out to us the reasons that had urged him to do so, and the right hon. Gentleman opposite said he knew the <span id="2543" class="column-number" data-column-number="2543"></span> Prime Minister had done it because he thought it was right. We all know that. We know the Prime Minister has always acted in what he thinks is the right way, and he has generally been right. At the same time, I know that he will realise that those of us who oppose it are doing so because we also think that our point of view is right. Those salaries were raised to£600, and although I voted against that rise, I did realise that there might be very hard cases. I saw there were hon. Members who really could not make both ends meet on their£400. When we did that I did not like taking that money from the taxpayers unless it was absolutely necessary for those people, and to-day my difficulty is this: I was urged at that time to support the Measure. I was told it was necessary because of those people who had been in poverty, and now we are told that there will not be any poverty without that£12. In other words we have been taking from the taxpayer£7,000 a year that is not necessary. It is that point that still makes me feel that if hon. Members in this House can carry out their work on£588, we ought to give back to the State and the taxpayer that£7,000.<p></p> When the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer was good enough to reply to some of my points in the Debate on 2nd February, there was one point on which he told me I was entirely wrong. I suggested that as that money was not required it should be given back to the State, and as it had only been taken in order to let people in this House have what I may call a living wage, that living wage could be£588 and the money ought to go back to the State. Therefore, if we take the money away from the Members who are serving in this House and put it to another fund, we are definitely taking away money that ought to go back to the taxpayers. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer replied to me pointing out that both he and the Prime Minister had pointed out that if the salaries were raised to£600 it might enable some pension scheme to be provided for. His argument on that occasion was, "We have not taken more money than we require." The£600 that was given to us was given, I gather from this statement, because a pensions scheme was envisaged; in other <span id="2544" class="column-number" data-column-number="2544"></span> words more than was necessary as a living wage was given in order to provide a pensions scheme. I presume that was what was meant. If so, how can we say that the effect of a pensions scheme is not a charge upon the taxpayer?<p></p> The reason I am going to oppose this Measure—we all know it is a free vote, but I may say that if it were a three-line Whip, I should equally oppose it because I think it is wrong—is that I feel we are not doing what the country would expect us to do in these days of high taxation. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lewisham (Sir A. Pownall) spoke of the amount of money and the amount of Income Tax, and said that it was a matter of a few thousand pounds. He talked of a twopenny-halfpenny scheme and of a one-millionth part of the Budget. It is suggestions like that which are going to send this country to bankruptcy. If, because you have to spend large sums of money, every other small sum gets entirely out of proportion, and you say, "It does not matter if we spend a million, because we are spending one hundred millions "—very well, let us spend on everything. Why should we say over and over again that we cannot afford this or that? If you take£5,000,000,£10,000,000 or£20,000,000, its proportion to the national expenditure at this moment is very small. Still, it does not cease to be£10,000,000 or£20,000,000.<p></p> I am convinced that to keep up the economic strength of the country and to get through these difficult times, we must, if necessary, have cheeseparing. We must look after every penny. We seem to be getting into the stage of imagining that a few thousand pounds, or even a million or two, do not amount to very much, but the taxpayer does not take that view, and the very worst propaganda that could go out from this House is the suggestion that we here think so little of hundreds of thousands of pounds. If we do not require this£7,000 for our ordinary everyday work, we ought to give it back. We ought not to say that we will keep it and do something else with it. The hon. Member for St. Albans (Sir F. Fremantle), who seconded the Motion on 2nd February, began on the high moral tone, talking about generosity as if it was out of our own generosity we were proposing to do this. As <span id="2545" class="column-number" data-column-number="2545"></span> I have said, it is not in the least our own generosity. There is no generosity about it.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Does the hon. Member suggest that we should run all our legislation on those lines? Suppose we did, why should the Opposition vote against any Bill? Why should they not say, "Let it go through and in future years we can repeal it "? What would happen if we were to deal with all our legislation by saying, "This Bill is no good, but it will do for the moment and we can have another Bill later on"? I am sincere in saying that I do not object to giving up£12 a year. Naturally, I have not the expenses that many other hon. Members have, but I do not object in the slightest degree. At the same time, if I vote for this scheme I have to realise that there will be somebody else representing Dundee in the future. He might be a man who had no money at all, and who had great difficulties to meet. I have to realise that in this matter I am not speaking for myself alone, but for other Members who will come afterwards. <span id="2546" class="column-number" data-column-number="2546"></span> But to return to the hon. Member for St. Albans. In seconding the Motion on 2nd February he quoted Scripture. Perhaps he will remember the quotation. At that time I was rather interested to note the part of the Scriptures from which the hon. Member quoted. I thought the significance of it would leap to the hon. Member's mind at once. The hon. Member went to the Scriptures to find inspiration for his statement in that Debate and from what part of the Scriptures did he quote? The part which he quoted was the Parable of the Unjust Steward. If I were to vote for this Measure, I should certainly feel that I was in the position of an unjust steward. We are here to look after the interests of the taxpayers of the country as a whole, and the big thing for this House to do, if we decide that£588 per year is enough for Members, is to arrange that the remaining£12 shall be given back.<p></p> At the same time, I believe that a different type of pension scheme could be put into force. I believe we could have a voluntary scheme. As the Prime Minister said, it might not be able always to supply the necessary funds at first, but I believe that a capital fund could be built up in time. I believe that people who were formerly Members of the House and are now in another place would join in such a scheme. I believe there are people in the constituencies, who have been interested in politics for a long time and who may also have been Members of the House and who would join in such a voluntary scheme. I do not believe that any hon. Member who thinks over the matter carefully can say that it would be impossible to raise a voluntary fund and a fund like that would be much better than the proposal in the Bill. In this Debate, as in the previous Debate, several hon. Members have said that this is in no way different; they have talked about this as a donation and about Members being generous enough to give£12 to this fund. But this is not a donation. Hon. Members need not feel that they are being in the least bit generous. This simply means that they will not get the£12. It will be taken for this purpose.<p></p> Then the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 2nd February said this proposal was just the same as if hon. Members met together as private people and agreed to <span id="2547" class="column-number" data-column-number="2547"></span> put their hands in their pockets and provide this sum, in a purely voluntary way. That is the sort of example which has been given to-night by one Member after another. We have been told that this is a purely domestic matter. If we are here as private individuals agreeing to put up this amount out of our own pockets, why are we not meeting in a Committee room upstairs as ordinary private people? Why in other words are we not meeting to set up a voluntary scheme, instead of passing an Act of Parliament and making a scheme which will have to be kept within the limits of an Act of Parliament? Members of this House may fall on evil days before they reach the age of 60 or before they have been 10 years in the House. A Member may have illness, for instance. If we had a voluntary fund which would be more elastic than this proposal, we could then deal with such cases. If we pass a Measure of this sort, it will not be possible to do so. I believe that in this way, we shall not do what could be done by a voluntary scheme. I think this proposal is wrong. I think we are taking the taxpayers' money, and that we ought to hand back this£7,000, if we do not require it for the purpose for which it was given, and, on these grounds, I shall vote against the Bill.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I shall not detain the House long, because I think, with all respect, we have heard few arguments of any force against the Bill. I would say this about the point made by the Mover of the Amendment, that the Bill is perhaps a little untimely. I would have preferred this proposal to have been made <em>pari passu</em> with an extension of old age pensions. It is no use deceiving ourselves. We shall get to know all about this Bill in due course. I agree with the principle of the Bill, but I know that in the North of England, at any rate, Members of Parliament will hear all about the fact that we are taking care of ourselves again. After the allowance for expenses to Members had been extended by£200, at the first open-air meeting which I addressed there was a bevy of old age pensioners, and I sensed what was going to happen. At the end of the meeting they came forward and said, "Glad to see you. We see you've helped yourselves to£200 a year more. Couldn't <span id="2548" class="column-number" data-column-number="2548"></span> you find a bit for us? "There is no answer to that, with the pittance that they are getting. I would much prefer that this should come along at the same time as an extension of the old age pension. That extension is bound to come, and with all respect to the Prime Minister it is no use saying that it will not come. It has got to come, Prime Minister or no Prime Minister. It is an actual necessity for the aged poor of our country, and it is no good saying we shall never agree to it. As I say, I would prefer the Third Reading of this Bill, once the Second Reading is through, as it will be to-night, postponed until after an extension of the old age pension.<p></p> It seems to me that the only question before us to-night is whether or not there is to be a fund like this. If there is to be a fund—and all the arguments that I have heard go to show that there is a need for such a fund—then we must have it compulsory, because in no other way can you have an actuarial basis. There must be an actuarial basis, and there must be compulsion to arrive at it. How could any trustees, year by year, if Members could contract in and contract out of the fund, arrive at what was going to be in the fund? It would be unworkable, and, as I see it, the fund must be compulsory. The hon. Lady the Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) said that we were taking;£7,000 compulsorily from Members' pockets—in her case, I suppose, it would be a bag—and putting it into this fund, which meant£7,000 indirectly from public funds, but if I or any other hon. Member said we would insure our lives with part of the increase of salary which we got as Members, at a premium of£12 per annum, or 4s. a week, what would anybody else have to do with that? It does not affect the public at all.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. and gallant Member may be quite clear in his own mind as to what he wants to say, but I am sorry that I cannot follow him. I say that we cannot have contracting in and out of such a fund. What is the reason for all our health insurance funds, into which everybody has to pay, whether he likes it or not? My father was for many years a member of a friendly society, on <span id="2549" class="column-number" data-column-number="2549"></span> the voluntary system, as I am now. I have been for 35 years in a benevolent fund. It is true that it is voluntary, but I do not expect that I shall require any benefit from the fund; and many working men were friendly society men for many years before the State said they must join, compulsorily, health and unemployment insurance funds. The result, of course, has been that there is a sound actuarial basis for those funds such as the old superannuation funds had not got. Many of these old funds found they could not keep up the benefits which they were pledged to give to the members who originally joined them. For instance, the North Eastern Railway superannuation fund members got 3s. a week instead of about 15s. It seems to me to be quite clear that if there is to be a fund of this nature, it must be compulsory, because otherwise there can be no actuarial basis at all. It would only be a yearly slate club fund, divisible at the end of the year as lots of slate clubs are in the North of England.<p></p> With all respect to the Mover of the Amendment, whose speech did not do him justice, he said that the Prime Minister's speech was sloppy. He may be a good judge of that—</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">How can anything that is compulsory be sloppy? I could understand anybody saying that it is rigid or too rigid, but I cannot understand them saying it is sloppy, and the hon. Member's excuse justifies what I said, that his speech did not do him justice. He was rather sloppy in what he said, and he had not his usual clear thinking in that matter. I am glad that the Prime Minister has come in, because, as a supporter, and a faithful supporter, of his, I want to say something which he may not like with regard to a letter which he may not have sent out, but in North Cornwall we got to know about it, and it was published yesterday, in which it was said that 10 per cent. only of the old age pensions went on public assistance. That hurt me abominably. Has it never occurred to the writer of that letter <span id="2550" class="column-number" data-column-number="2550"></span> —it may have been the right hon. Gentleman's secretary—that more than 10 per cent., because of the natural pride of my class, did not want to go on public assistance and would rather starve? It hurt me abominably, and it would hurt me abominably if anybody said that only 10per cent. of the Members of this honourable House, men and women with whom I have associated for 10 years, required this, because some of them did not want, from natural pride, to appeal for charity.<p></p> Let us do this thing decently and well, of our own free will and accord. There can be no actuarial basis for the fund unless the trustees know without a doubt what they will have coming in every year, so that they can know what they are doing. Let us do the thing decently and well from the start. Let us put it on a sure foundation, and, for the sake of 4s. a week out of the£4 a week which we did not expect to get when we came here in 1935, let us do it with some kind of graciousness.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I should not have intervened in the Debate but for the speech of the hon. Lady the Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh). I support the scheme, and I cannot see that its supporters have much to answer in the criticisms made to-night. Nobody has opposed a pension scheme. Perhaps the most powerful opponent of the Bill was the hon. and gallant Member for Epsom (Sir A. Southby), and even he said, "I want a pension scheme, only I do not like this scheme," and, further, he said that this was not the right day. To an opponent of a scheme the day is never the right day. This day is not my day but it is the day chosen by the Government to bring it forward, and I do not judge whether it is the right or the wrong day but I take the scheme on its merits, knowing that if I do not take it this day I shall not get it at all. That meets him on that point. His other criticism was that this scheme is not good enough. When I heard that argument I had a notion to get up and say, "Damn your scheme, I am going to vote against it." I do not know whether I shall ever need it, but I have never been one of the fortunate Members. I have never had any income other than my Parliamentary salary, whether it was£400 or£600, and I happen to have a wife, and frankly I would say to the hon. <span id="2551" class="column-number" data-column-number="2551"></span> and gallant Member for Epsom that I certainly would not like to think that if I passed out she had to come cap in hand for his kind of Christian charity.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I am sure the hon. Member would not wish to misrepresent me. That is exactly why I object to the scheme. I tried to make it clear that what I did object to was the idea of anyone having to come cap in hand for charity. I advocated that it should be a national scheme, so that there should be no taint of charity about it.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Then there was the argument of the hon. Lady about the£12. A trade union is never satisfied with the wages its members are receiving, it always thinks that they are too small, but when a scheme like health insurance comes along the trade union does not say, "Do not take the money off the wages. "It says, "Take the money off"; but that does not mean to say that it regards the wage as enough. The worker in making his contribution to sickness and pension funds is not admitting that he is paid enough, but is showing that he is willing to forgo other necessities in order to provide for this greater necessity. I may have just enough to live on, but I take the view that I can afford to do without£12 worth of other things in order to make this contribution, because it will be money better spent than in other ways. The ordinary Member wishes to transfer£12 of his income from one desirable cause to a still more desirable one.<p></p> As to the argument that the present scheme is not the best scheme, I could advance all sorts of arguments against it. For one thing, I cannot follow why the£12 which a Member is to contribute to the scheme should be taxable. I do not think that is fair. But I take the scheme because I know that, whatever arguments one may put up against it, the only way of getting this matter dealt with is to take the scheme now before us. If we do not take it there will be no scheme at all. The proposal before us is that every Member of Parliament shall be compelled to give£12 a year to form a fund which shall be at the disposal of trustees for the purpose of paying out allowances to Members who have had 10 years' service if they need assistance on account of age or illness. Will anybody deny that <span id="2552" class="column-number" data-column-number="2552"></span> it is desirable to give to an old man who has served this House, or to a sick man, an allowance to keep him from poverty? Nobody will argue against that, and that is all that is suggested.<p></p> The only argument against it has been that it is compulsory. The truth is that even if it were voluntary it would become compulsory. In Glasgow every workman contributes something—on an average 6d. to is. a week—to Glasgow Infirmary. It is a voluntary contribution, and if he wished he could stop it to-morrow, but if he did he would immediately be taboo among all the other workmen in the place; and if 99 per cent. of the Members here were voluntarily contributing£12 a year to this fund the remaining 1 per cent. would be compelled to do so also, by sheer force of circumstances. I do not want to say hard things to the hon. Lady the Member for Dundee, because I think she is honest, but it has struck me as very funny that though she voted against the increase of£200 she takes the£200. [Hon. Members: "Why not?"] If I wanted the political kudos to be gained from voting against the extra£200 I certainly should not have the courage to take the money.<p></p> There is nothing extravagant about the pension proposals before us. I know Members of this House not confined to the Labour side—I know of one colleague who sits on the other side, a Conservative, who has rendered service to the House within his capacity and ability, who is lying ill to-day. He has a wife and children and has no means. Because that man passes out at the next election—illness has decreed it—why should I not make a contribution to see that his wife, at least, and his children, have some moderate means with which to maintain him? Is there anything wrong in that? I will make the contribution of£12 a year, as other Members will, and I say in reply to the hon. Member for Gates-head (Mr. Magnay), if he needs a reply, that when we do it I trust that it will be an encouragement to those outside who are on old age pensions to keep on with an agitation to see that at an early date they are as well treated as the Members of this House.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The granting and the subsequent increase of Members' salaries has to some extent changed the character <span id="2553" class="column-number" data-column-number="2553"></span> of the House, I think probably for the better, because we ought not to have a House composed of people who, having had industrious fathers or fathers-in-law, are enabled to indulge in the luxury of being Members of Parliament. I had to wait until I was nearly 50 years of age before I could indulge in the luxury on the fruits of vigorous exertions. I thought my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings (Mr. Hely-Hutchinson) made a somewhat unsympathetic speech. It struck me as an unkindly speech. I should not like to see any man kept out of the House because he had not the necessary means. At the same time being a Member of Parliament is a great honour and a great luxury, and it is a form of publicity which people like to indulge in. Yet there are always a large number of people who have not been too successful in managing their own affairs and want to be put in a position to manage other people's, and they become Members of Parliament, and sometimes they become great leaders. For instance, Disraeli in his early life was always in the hands of moneylenders, and he had to be assisted by the leaders of the Conservative party. He married a wealthy wife, but it did not work out as in the case of Lord Tennyson's farmer who advised his sons, "Do not marry for money, boys, you can borrow far cheaper."<p></p> The thing that I regret most about the Bill is that it is introduced by a Conservative Prime Minister, of whom I am a faithful follower and who has done more for the country than I can recollect anyone else doing. For political capital is being made out of it. The "Daily Herald"had a taunting article on the proposal and the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) the other day took a strong line against it for political reasons. A lot of people want to and will make capital out of this.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I think it is necessary that Members who have been long in Parliament should be made secure, because after a man has been 10 or 20 years in Parliament he is no use in any other walk in life. All public life destroys a man's capacity for honest work. I remember an ex-Lord Provost of Glasgow telling me how he had asked his brother to join the town council and he would fill his place at the mill. He went back to the mill, and he told me that he had forgotten what work was like. If that is the case in a limited application of public affairs in a town council, how much worse must it be in the House of Commons. I remember, when I first came here and was asked to take decisions on anything, contrasting the elaborate care and pains that I took in my cases, exhausting every issue, contrasted with the hasty decisions I now had to make. I was quite glad even of the assistance of the Whip. If the country uses 600 men and keeps them for years, and destroys their practical usefulness for earning their daily bread, it ought to provide for them after they have had a sufficiently long experience to realise that their capacities are very much diminished. It is the logical corollary of salaries for Members.<p></p> What I object to in this scheme is that while the recipients do not pay Income Tax those who are levied on are taxed on money they do not receive. This is forsooth to prevent an alleged charge on the public funds, yet there is this amount of charge on the public funds. The trustees of the funds are not to pay Income Tax, so we are not entirely taken away from the idea that there is a charge on the public funds. But why should there not be a charge on the public funds? Those who pay Surtax will be paying not£12 but£24 or£25. No one need tell me that not to charge Income Tax would be a concession and that the Government would be giving them something. They are not giving them anything. They simply refrain from taking some of their money. When the Government remit taxation they are not making a present to the taxpayer, they are dipping their predatory hands a little less deeply into his pocket. I do not get the money. It is taken from me at the source. I never <span id="2555" class="column-number" data-column-number="2555"></span> smell it. I have not the satisfaction of counting the Treasury notes. This£12 will not be paid out of my Parliamentary salary. It is added to my general income and I have to pay heavy taxes on it. I do not see why I should pay tax on a sum of money that I am contributing out of the goodness of my heart to other people who will not be taxed on it at all. The logical thing is to tax the recipients, but you cannot do that because the amount that they receive is too little. Why should the contribution not be free of Income Tax?<p></p> I am not going to vote for the Bill and my reason is that I think it is an injustice to take Income Tax from a man upon money that he does not receive and has had no chance of receiving. It is a strong injustice. This is a fundamentally unjust proposal, and all because some pedantic people have said that it is a charge on the public funds. It is not a charge on the public funds to relieve of Income Tax money that is given to poor people. I can well do without£12, but not the taxes. I have 12 grandchildren. I do not want their little birthday presents and Christmas boxes to suffer. When I say I have 12 grandchildren I ought to explain that I have at the present moment 10 on whom the sun spreads its light, and that I am expecting two. I am entitled to count them in because, according to the Roman law, on which Scots law is founded, the date of a man's birth is the date of his conception and not the date on which he actually saw the light. This shows what exact people these Romans were. They must have kept their diaries with great particularity. I never knew anyone in this country who could have been specific except the father of Tristram Shandy. Perhaps hon. Members remember the opening passage of that great classic, when Mrs. Shandy asked Mr. Shandy senior, "My dear, have you forgotten to wind up the clock?" Mr. Shandy senior said," Was ever a man interrupted with such a foolish question since the world began?" What was my father saying? Nothing.<p></p> I believe I can do without the£12, but when I am asked to pay tax on it, it seems such an injustice that I revolt against it. I have not been to Eton or any other place for exploiting youth. Thank God, I never was at any school; <span id="2556" class="column-number" data-column-number="2556"></span> no schoolmaster ever stupefied my intelligence. Boys go to school for years and come out as dull at ditchwater because they have had pedants over them all the time. That is why so few people think for themselves. The hon. Member for Sowerby (Mr. McCorquodale) for instance said that he was persuaded to accept this scheme because a committee had reported in favour of it, and that he always thought it wise to follow the best advice. I am not sure that it is wise. I recollect a very eminent Canadian statesman who was extremely successful in life. He was asked the reason why he never made a muddle and he said:" Thank God that I am stone deaf and I have never been able to take advice from anybody. Whenever I took advice from anybody I was always very sorry that I had not followed my own opinion.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">In that case the people had sound advice. The suggestion has been made that this might have been a voluntary scheme, but I am afraid that that would not entirely work. If we were Dumb Friends and not Members of Parliament, if we were cats and dogs, money would be thrown at us, but simply because we are human beings and are not dumb, there is no sympathy for us. I shall go into the Lobby to protest against this injustice of taxing Members who do not get the money on which they are taxed. It is simply trying to please both the objectors to and the promoters of the scheme, and one should never try to please two people of opposite opinions. That lands you nowhere. I sympathise with the motive behind the Bill, because I think there ought to be some provision, but this injustice is too great. To tax a man by collecting his money at a centre and handing it out to poor people, telling him that it is a privilege to help his poorer brethren and fining him for doing it, is a monstrous proposal which in itself justifies reconsideration of the Bill, and I hope that in Committee that Clause will disappear.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I rise to support the Bill for the simple reason that the arguments I have heard have convinced me that the Bill is correct and a move in the <span id="2557" class="column-number" data-column-number="2557"></span> right direction; and the most convincing arguments that I have heard in favour of the Bill have been the speeches of those who say they are opposed to it, with the one exception of the Prime Minister. I am sure that every one of us, irrespective of our point of view, was deeply impressed by his opening remarks. He demonstrated to us all what a big heart he has, and followed the divine injunction, "Blessed are the merciful." The arguments that I have heard against the Bill have, as I have said, convinced me of its necessity. Before the discussion was opened, I was asked in the Outer Lobby how I was going to vote on the Bill, and I said that most probably I should vote against it; but every speech that I have heard against the Bill has turned me in the opposite direction.<p></p> The hon. Lady the Member for Dundee (Miss Horsbrugh) said that we could all open a voluntary fund. I do not think that the trustees under this Bill would refuse, or that there is anything in the Bill that would prevent them from accepting, gifts from hon. Members of this House or from Members of the other House who were originally here; but I agree with the hon. Member for Gates-head (Mr. Magnay) that, if we are to have a satisfactory Measure at all, it must be a compulsory Measure. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Epsom (Sir A. Southby) criticised the idea of a fixed equal contribution. I suppose his idea was that Members should pay according to their private incomes. But I would ask any hon. Member here if that could possibly be carried out in a legal enactment. There must be an equal contribution. Everyone knows that in workmens' organisations, whatever a man's private income, he pays the same contribution as all the others for his unemployment insurance his old age pension, his health insurance, or whatever it may be. My hon. and gallant Friend also tried to make the point that this is a club and said that clubs do not usually insure their members. My experience is entirely the opposite. I am not speaking of political clubs, or of rich mens clubs in the ordinary sense, but among the working-class people of this country, whom we all claim to represent, they have their clubs and they insure that no member of the club is left to cold charity in his declining days.<p></p><span id="2558" class="column-number" data-column-number="2558"></span> Some Members have said that we can depend on charity. Knowing what I do, I say, Heaven help Members or previous Members of this House, and the widows they leave behind them, if they have to depend on the cold comfort of charity. Another criticism has been that Members can ill afford the£12 that will be deducted. All I can say in answer to that is that the people who are keenest on the deduction and most in favour of the Bill are those, so far as I can see, who have the lowest incomes. The critics say that this is not the right time to introduce the Bill, and that the Bill is not what it might have been. I ask them, will any time be the right time, or will any Bill suit their requirements? We have to have this Bill or none, and it can be altered in Committee if there is any Clause with which they are dissatisfied. The hon. Member for Central Leeds (Mr. Denman) seemed to object to the Prime Minister describing his proposal as pedantic. I have not had time to look up the dictionary definition of "pedantic" but I should say that a pedantic person is one who confines himself to minute and irrelevant details. If any speech could be criticised as pedantic, it was that which the hon. Member for Central Leeds made to-night. He went into details—if I may say so, with all kindness—which had absolutely nothing to do with the Bill.<p></p> The hon. Member who moved the rejection said that the finances of democratic States were bad because of sloppy sentimentalism. Are the finances of democratic States in a worse condition than those of totalitarian States? Sentiment rules the world; it always has done, and I hope it always will. The longer I live and the more I see of this House, the less admiration have I for those who say that they are guided by logic on every occasion. The hon. and learned Member for Argyll (Mr. Macquisten) claims to be logical; but his speech was mainly in support of the Bill, and yet he told us that he intends to vote against it.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">No. I objected to the Income Tax Clause, but I have had a discussion with the promoter, who pointed out that if the Bill passed its Second Reading I could get that Clause which so excited my wrath deleted in Committee.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I apologise to the hon. and learned Member. I am glad that he <span id="2559" class="column-number" data-column-number="2559"></span> is going into the same Lobby as I am. Hon. Members opposite spoke as if hon. Members above the Gangway were the only people who were in favour of the Bill. Some of us who are supporting the Bill have been supporters of the Conservative party all our lives, and claim to be as good Conservatives as they are, but that does not prevent us from wanting to help our weaker brethren in the House. I know men who have served this House, who have been political opponents of mine, and whom it has been my privilege to defeat at elections, and my heart has been touched by the position of those men after they have ceased to be Members. I shall be prepared to help any man who falls by the way, as long as the money is found by ourselves and constitutes no charge on the public purse. No one can say that this is going to be a charge on the public purse. Some people have tried by all sorts of arguments and innuendoes to show that it is gong to cost the State something. I hope that they will withdraw those remarks because the public might easily get the impression that it will cost the State something. It will not cost the State one penny, and we want that fact to be expressed even by opponents of this Bill.<p></p> I ask those who are at present opposed to this Bill to withdraw their opposition. A suggestion was made that this was a heritage which we had received from a former Prime Minister of this House. If it is, I am prouder of it that ever, because I had, and still have, a deep admiration for that Gentleman who used to lead this House, and I want hon. Members, particularly those who are on my side of politics, to support the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in this matter. After all is said and done, they will pay their contribution like the majority of us without receiving a penny compensation in any way. We are looking to the future and trying to remedy something which has been a disgrace by ensuring that no man or woman who has served the country and served this House for at least 10 years shall be left without means. Members will be compelled to face the electors of the country in at least three elections and receive their approval.<p></p> One hon. Member suggested that it would create pocket boroughs. I deny <span id="2560" class="column-number" data-column-number="2560"></span> that assertion. The electors are free subjects and they will not be influenced because a man. has been a Member for six or seven years and give him a further period of office for the sake of enabling him to qualify for a pension. I ask hon. Members with whom I generally vote to sink their private predilections on this matter and see if they cannot withdraw their opposition and rally to the support of the Prime Minister, of whom many of us have been exceedingly proud in the past. We are more proud of him than ever for bringing in this Measure, which will in the future, I believe, add prestige to the Members of this House and particularly to those who are at present in it.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I should like to explain why I cannot see my way to vote for this Bill, the Seconding Reading of which has been moved by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. To vote against the Government, or, what I consider to be pretty much the same thing, to vote against a Measure which is sponsored by the Leader of my party, has never been a favourite pastime of mine. The hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Argyll (Mr. Macquisten) said that he frequently voted contrary to the instructions of the Whips.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I take the hon. and learned Member's word for it. I shall vote against this Bill, because I consider that its introduction at the present time is both unwise and inopportune. Faced as we are at the present time with increasingly insistent demands for pensions on every hand, it seems to me that we are weakening our power of opposing such measures, although we feel that the country cannot afford to pay for them. At the present time there is an insistent demand for an increase in old age pensions. There is also an increasing demand for spinsters' pensions. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that on every hand there is some demand for pensions springing up. At the present time the country can ill afford to honour any promise made in that respect.<p></p> I am not one of those who believe that because the country can afford to borrow£600,000,000,£700,000,000 or£800,000,000 for rearmaments, we can at the same time borrow£30,000,000 or£40,000,000 annually to supplement the existing old age pensions. Any attempt to do so would only have one result, and that would be a repetition of the financial crisis with which we were confronted in 1931. Some of the electorate will say, inaccurately: "You can afford to provide pensions for yourselves, although you are drawing from the funds of the country salaries of£600 a year, and on the other hand you say that you cannot afford to increase the miserable pittance of 10s. a week which you are paying us, although never at any time were we in a position to earn more than 40s. a week." It is because I feel that I could not con- <span id="2562" class="column-number" data-column-number="2562"></span> trovert those arguments when I meet them in my constituency, as I am certain to meet them within the next few months, that I am going to vote against this Measure.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I rise to say that this Bill will in no way affect me personally, but I want to put two points of view. I am going to vote for the Measure, although it contains two things that I personally resent. One is, that it establishes for ever the miserable and hateful means test. I do not see how you can accept the means test in this House for yourselves and not justify it for anyone else. For that reason, I would much have preferred to have paid twice or thrice the money for a genuine pension scheme than to have had a Measure such as this. My second point is that many hon. Members have been subscribing for pensions all their working lives. Other Members of the House, not subscribing for pensions, will have perhaps at the end of their lives, we will say, a sum of£3,000. If they get a return of 2½ per cent. on that sum they will receive£75 a year. The man who has£3,000 capital and gets from it an income of£75 a year will, or may, get£150 a year from this scheme. It would be wrong for a man with a capital of£3,000 from which he derives an annual income of£75 to get£150 out of this scheme.<p></p> On the other hand, a man who has been subscribing for years to a pension scheme, who has put his capital into a pension scheme, and has no income from that capital, will not be in any way supported by this scheme. The whole basis of the scheme is wrong. It should have been a full benefit scheme contributed to by hon. Members. We could defend that scheme in the country, as we can defend the principle of this Bill, because it is hon. Members who are subscribing to it—not the people of the country. The hon. Member for North-West Hull (Sir A. Lambert-Ward) said that he could not justify this scheme because it would be stated that it was doing something for Members of Parliament. I think that is false reasoning. I am going to support the Bill, but I hope the time will not be far distant when, by virtue of the anomalies which will arise out of the working of the Bill, we shall have a <span id="2563" class="column-number" data-column-number="2563"></span> full pension scheme for Members of Parliament.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">We have listened to a powerful speech against the Bill by the hon. Member for Rotherhithe (Mr. Benjamin Smith) who has, however, announced his intention of voting for it. With every argument he has put forward against the Bill I entirely agree. It seems to me that it is ill-judged and ill-timed. This is hardly the moment when, for reasons which I think are perfectly adequate, the Government are unable to increase the pensions which are now given to old age pensioners—I entirely support the Government in that decision—in which not only Parliamentary time, but Parliamentary thought and effort should be devoted to a Bill which is entirely in the interests of Members of Parliament. We may say it is a good Bill or a bad Bill, but nobody can dispute this fact, that it has one object in view only, and that is the interest of hon. Members of this House. When we are faced with the fearful international situation which is hanging over us, when we are faced at the same time with the great and increasing difficulties of old age pensioners, it is disastrous that we should deliberately embark on a scheme which is in our own interests only and nobody else's on a scheme which, as shown when it was introduced as a private Member's Motion, is bound to create controversy; and on a scheme which when the Motion was discussed showed that a majority of the supporters of the National Government were opposed to it. I think it is disastrous that at such a moment this Bill should be proceeded with.<p></p> We all feel, as the Prime Minister has said, with friends of ours, who are suffering from lack of means in their old age or with their dependants who are suffering, but, as a matter of fact, no income can ensure anyone against those disadvantages. The hon. Member for Rotherhithe said that the Bill did not concern him in any way. He speaks with great confidence, and I am glad that he is in such a strong position as to be perfectly confident that he, at any rate, will never be in need of assistance. Personally, and speaking for many of my hon. Friends, I know that it is a very unwise assertion to make that one will never have to face <span id="2564" class="column-number" data-column-number="2564"></span> financial difficulties. Anybody who has any experience of this world is well aware of the fact that size of income is not the final test as to whether in old age we shall lack means ourselves or at death be unable to bequeath sufficient to our dependants to support them. Surely, experience shows that all these cases must be tested as cases by themselves. I know of cases where Members of the House have, owing to unforeseen circumstances, owing to their being cut off in the prime of life, left insufficient to support their dependants, not because of any lack of foresight, but because of ill-fortune. Time and again those cases have been met by the contributions of fellow Members. There have been cases of that sort among Members in every walk of life and every society. There have been cases where, for instance, children were ill-provided for and their education could not be completed, and friends and colleagues have generously subscribed.<p></p> This Bill will not meet that difficulty. The sum of£150 a year will not meet the particular difficulty of tiding over a difficult period. That is a difficulty which can be met only by generous contributions from friends and colleagues, and those contributions, I must say, will not be forthcoming in the future when Members feel that they have already contributed out of their highly taxed salaries£12 a year towards the possible misfortunes of their fellow Members. If they are asked for a further contribution, they will feel that it is too much, and that they are already paying all which they can justly be called upon to pay towards the possible contingencies that arise in every walk of life.<p></p> I suggest to hon. Members opposite that this Bill will not help them in their political future. It will be misrepresented in the country. This is a Bill which does not divide parties. It is a Bill which concerns all Members of Parliament. We all know that in our fights in our constituencies we have to meet with arguments which are not always fair or just, and the argument that will be stated against us is simply this, that at a time when we were taking on obligations unheard and undreamt of by all previous Parliaments to meet international conditions that had not been foreseen, when owing to those tremendous obligations and those increased payments in taxation <span id="2565" class="column-number" data-column-number="2565"></span> we felt it impossible, for financial reasons, although many of us recognised the obligation, to increase the pittance given to old age pensioners, in the same week, and in the same Parliament in which we had increased our own salaries by£200, we spent the time of Parliament and the time of the nation in arranging a scheme, which has been denounced as a bad scheme, for giving a small pension to some unfortunate Members of Parliament who may not have made sufficient provision in their lives to support their dependants after they had departed.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I think the House must now be nearly ready to divide on the Motion for the Second Reading of this Bill, which has now been debated for several hours, and I hope hon. Members will feel it is appropriate for me to say one or two words to wind up the Debate. We have heard a number of speeches both for and against the Bill. The general impression left upon my mind, I must say, is that hon. Members who have spoken have come here with their minds made up one way or the other, and that they are not very open to argument. I want at any rate to repeat what I said before, that in spite of what was said by my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment opposing the Second Reading of the Bill, this is a free vote of the House which is to be taken to-night, and I am not asking anybody to vote for the Bill because of any personal feelings of loyalty towards me or towards the Government. This is a matter which affects Members of the House alone, and I consider that every Member is entitled to make up his own mind as to the proper course to take, and to vote in accordance with his conscience.<p></p> Having said that, let me say that it seems to me that there has been general agreement on one point—that the present position is unsatisfactory. Nobody has felt that it was creditable, or conducive to the dignity of the House as a whole, that it should be possible for men who have been Members of the House for a long period and who, as the hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Macquisten) said in his amusing speech, had deprived themselves, or had been deprived by their service in this House of their usefulness in other directions, to find themselves in straightened circumstances and be compelled <span id="2566" class="column-number" data-column-number="2566"></span> completely to change their standard and mode of life. The arguments that have been addressed against the Bill have not been on the grounds that some provision should not be made for such a contingency as that. They have been rather directed to the method or the time at which the Bill is brought forward.<p></p> As to the method, there have been two lines of argument adduced against the method proposed in the Bill. One is that it would be far better to have a voluntary scheme. I do not want to repeat what I said in moving the Second Reading. I think I was able to show then that, as a practical measure, no voluntary scheme could be satisfactory, and no voluntary scheme has been brought forward or suggested which could provide what is requred. It is true, as was suggested by the hon. Member for Bolton (Sir J. Haslam), that there is nothing in the scheme to prevent the fund which is to be set up under the Bill being added to by voluntary contributions, whether gifts or legacies, by hon. Members, which would enable greater benefits to be given than are possible from the income obtained from the statutory deductions from Members salaries. But a voluntary scheme which means an uncertain income is one that cannot be considered adequate to meet the case.<p></p> There is another line of argument that, if there is any justification for making periodical payments to former Members of this House, they should be made a charge on public funds, that we should have the courage of our opinions, and that as we have voted ourselves salaries so we should also vote ourselves pensions out of public funds. That is a very noble and courageous attitude to take up, but I would ask hon. Members to address themselves to this question—is it practical politics? Is anybody prepared to say that it is possible to get this House to pass a Measure, which would deserve the sort of censure which has been suggested by my right hon. Friend who has just spoken, at a time when many of us are saying that the finances of the country will not run to expensive schemes of social service which, on their merits, we should all desire to see carried out?</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I really do not think that is relevant to the point I am making, which is a very much narrower one and I am not prepared to enter upon a discussion of that kind now. I think the real question before us to-night is that which was put forcibly by the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan). We have a practical scheme before us now which can be carried out and which will achieve the general objects we have in mind. Is there any other scheme we can think of, which is likely to be more practical than the one now before the House? I venture to think there is not. The question is this—if we want a scheme at all, we had better take the scheme which is before us while we can get it, and not allow ourselves to be diverted by the possibility that some better scheme might be devised.<p></p> It is a little difficult for me to meet two sets of objections at the same time. When the Resolution was adopted, there was criticism on the ground that it was indirectly a charge upon public funds. When we tried to meet that criticism by inserting a provision that deductions from salaries are still to be subject to Income Tax, we are then met with the opposite argument that that is a very unjust and unfair thing. Indeed, it is so contrary to the sense of justice of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Macquisten), that at one moment he would have been prepared to vote against the Bill. I understand that although he is in favour of the principle of the Bill and although he voted for the Resolution, he still thinks he ought not to vote for the Bill on account of that provision. I suggest to him that what he wants to do is to vote for the Bill, and then, if he likes, to move an Amendment to omit the particular provision which will make the deduction from salaries subject to Income Tax. Although I sympathise with his feeling that it is repugnant to pay taxation on income which we have never received, yet a good many of us have to endure that injustice, if it be an injustice, at the present time.<p></p><span id="2568" class="column-number" data-column-number="2568"></span> The incidence of Surtax comes not upon the reduced income after it has paid Income Tax, but upon the gross income before the deduction of Income Tax.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Therefore, people have to pay Surtax on a certain amount of income which they have never received. I do not wish to detain the House by repeating arguments which have already been used, but I think the short point to be made is this. Here is a practical scheme which may be open to objections from one point of view or another, but which is not a scheme imposing any tax upon the general taxpayer. I confess I am not at all moved by the argument of some of my hon. and right hon. Friends that this might be made a subject of misrepresentation in the country. I have never thought it right to refrain from doing anything which I felt was right, because it was likely to be misrepresented in the country. I think it is the duty of hon. Members, if they think that a particular Measure is going to be misrepresented, to correct that misrepresentation.<p></p> I cannot see how anybody can find it difficult to distinguish between a proposition which imposes no penny of charge upon the general taxpayer, and which is a private arrangement among Members of the House, and another proposition, which proposes to devote millions of the taxpayers' money to the benefits of a particular section of the community. I am not arguing the merits of that matter in the least. What I am saying is that there is no comparison whatsoever between any proposition to vary the rates of pensions, old age or any other kind, at the public charge and a scheme of this kind, which imposes no public charge at all. Anybody who says that he is unable to face his constituents to meet a charge of that kind does seem to me to be open to that charge of sloppy thinking of which we have heard during this Debate. I have said before that I am not going to bear any malice or resentment against any hon. Member who usually supports the Government, but who does not agree with the views that I have expressed on this Bill. At the same time, I venture to say, as Leader of the House, that I do hope that this Bill will be carried by a <span id="2569" class="column-number" data-column-number="2569"></span> substantial majority, because I believe that in so doing it will be conducive to the dignity and the good name of this House.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">It is impossible for me to vote for this Bill so long as 10 per cent. of the old age pensioners have to seek public assistance. The second reason I oppose this Bill is that in these days, when democracy is in danger because people put self-interest before national interest and politicians outbid each other by offering more public money to individuals, we, as Members of Parliament, should give an example to the country and not vote for our own benefit, otherwise the only successful politicians at elections will be those who promise old age pensions with the birth certificate. It seems to me that we are doing the wrong thing in voting for this Bill. Having made this protest, I hope that we shall set an example to the nation by not voting for our own pensions before we provide for an increase in the old folks pensions.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">hon. Friend the Prime Minister that it is so very seldom that some of his supporters get a chance of addressing this House, particularly on a question that affects us very much in our own divisions, that I have to insist, in spite of the invitation to divide, on putting one point to my right hon. Friend. He talked about misrepresentation in the divisions on this matter. There is one point that will not be misrepresented. It will be put point blank, and correctly, as far as I am concerned, and it is this: I, along with other Members of different parties, have had a Motion on the Paper for several months asking for time to be given to discuss a point which is of great interest to the local authorities of this country—the question of the old age pensioner who is compelled to seek the help of public assistance. I have been told by my right hon. Friend, and so have other hon. Members, that time could not be found to discuss that matter. That is a matter which affects at least 240,000 people, constituents of ours. This matter to-night, for which time has been found, affects how many? At the most 615, and I am afraid that that will be not misrepresented, but if it is put from my platform, it will be the truth.</p>
