<p class="">I beg to move, <blockquote><q>"That Mr. Speaker be requested to convey to Sir Horace Christian Dawkins, K.C.B., <span id="38" class="column-number" data-column-number="38"></span> M.B.E., on his retirement from the Office of Clerk of this House, the assurance of its sincere appreciation of the valuable aid it has derived from his profound knowledge of the law and custom of Parliament, acquired during upwards of forty-six years of devoted service in different offices, of which nineteen years have been spent at the Table, where his experience and ready advice have rendered constant assistance to the House and its Members in the conduct of its ever-increasing business."</q></blockquote> On the last day before the House dispersed for the Summer Recess you, Sir, read to us a letter which you had received from Sir Horace Dawkins in which he made known his desire to resign his Patent as Clerk of the House and expressed the hope that his performance of the duties of that office had had the approval of hon. Members whom he had been privileged to serve. In moving the Resolution on the Paper which stands in my name, and which is designed to give us all an opportunity of expressing that approval which Sir Horace Dawkins sought, I am only following precedent, but I feel very confident that on this occasion I shall have the support of hon. Members in all parts of the House, not because of precedent, but because of the regard which we all feel for Sir Horace Dawkins. In this Resolution it is recorded that he has spent 46 years—practically the whole of his working life —in the service of this House. During the earlier part of that time, I imagine, there are very few of us who were Members of the House ourselves, but for the last 19 years Sir Horace has been a familiar figure at this Table, where he first took his seat as Second Clerk Assistant in 1918, which happens to be the year in which I myself first entered Parliament.<p></p> During the last seven years he has acted as Clerk of this House. I suppose that the first qualification for that office is a thorough mastery of the Procedure of this House. In that respect Sir Horace Dawkins' complete competence is unquestioned; but he has, I think, something more, something which is perhaps not less valuable, and that is a certain gift of shrewd common sense—a quality which is not as common as the name implies —which, when it is applied to the Procedure of this House, makes all the difference to the smoothness and celerity with which it works. With that common sense and with his full knowledge of our Procedure, the professional qualifications <span id="39" class="column-number" data-column-number="39"></span> of the Clerk of the House are perhaps satisfied, but there still remain those personal characteristics which became manifest in his dealings with other people, in his dealings, Sir, with you, with his colleagues at the Table, with Members of the Government and with all hon. Members of this House who constantly, both in the House and in his own room, applied to him for guidance and for assistance.<p></p> It is those personal characteristics which have endeared Sir Horace to his colleagues and to all of us. He is fortunate enough to be possessed of a singularly sweet and even temper. I have never seen him ruffled, although there must have been many moments of the day and of the night in which his patience was sorely tried. He has always been courteous and sympathetic, ready to answer any question anybody might put to him, ready to give the benefit of his great knowledge and experience. He ever kept in mind the high traditions of his office, an office which he has filled with dignity and distinction, and I feel sure we all desire now to express our sorrow that we shall see him among us no more, and our hope that he may find happiness and contentment of mind in his retirement.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I rise to associate my friends of the Opposition and myself with the Motion which the Prime Minister has moved so felicitously. We in this House are deeply indebted to those who serve us, and among those servants there is none who has given greater and longer service than Sir Horace Dawkins and who has been more acceptable to all Members of the House. I think that he has been a friend to every Member, and we shall miss him very much from his place. Periodically we have those eruptions called General Elections, when old faces disappear from the House and Members change their positions, but the Clerks at the Table go on and give stability to our proceedings. Now we shall look up and we shall miss his presence, but I am sure that in his retirement he will be watching over us. We all trust that his years of retirement may be long and blessed with good health and happiness.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I rise to support the Motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition, and to associate <span id="40" class="column-number" data-column-number="40"></span> my hon. Friends and myself with the tributes that have been paid to Sir Horace Dawkins. It is sad for us all to be parting from our experienced guide, wise counsellor and friend, Sir Horace Dawkins, and it is right that we should take this opportunity of expressing, as representatives of the people as well as on our own behalf, our appreciation of the 46 years' service which Sir Horace Dawkins has given to the country in this House. Better than anyone outside we realise the immense strain which is thrown upon the machinery of Parliament when it is working at top pressure. That Parliament does accomplish as much as it does is largely due to those who, in our Committee Rooms and at that Table, ceaselessly and vigilantly superintend its machinery. Among them this House has had no more faithful and distinguished servant than Sir Horace Dawkins, who will, we hope, long live to enjoy the happiness of private life, and to whom we pay so willingly this tribute of our respect and gratitude.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">
