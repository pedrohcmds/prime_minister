<p class="">I beg to move, "That this House do now adjourn."<p></p> I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister will be surprised that the statement which he made to the House this afternoon in respect of the Egyptian negotiations has caused us grave concern, and that we should have sought the earliest Parliamentary opportunity to obtain further information from the Government and to explain to the House the reasons for our anxiety. I think the right hon. Gentleman will admit that on all aspects of foreign affairs since this Government was formed His Majesty's Opposition have sought not to embarrass it in the conduct of its policy, and in what I say tonight I shall not be unmindful, whatever my anxieties may be, of the fact that negotiations are now proceeding. At the same time, there are certain duties which this House has to perform and, as I conceive it, there are certain questions which it is our duty to ask the Government at this time.<p></p> Let me first make it plain that we are in full agreement with the first two sentences of the statement which the right hon. Gentleman read out this afternoon, that is to say, if I may quote them: <blockquote><q>"It is the considered policy of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to consolidate their alliance with Egypt as one between two equal nations having interests in common."</q></blockquote> That is our view also, and we also agree that <blockquote><q>"In pursuance of this policy"—</q></blockquote> we trust this latter part is true, although we do not know— <blockquote><q>"negotiations have begun in an atmosphere of cordiality and goodwill."</q></blockquote> To that there is no objection. It is only to the third sentence that we have anxiety which I propose to express.<p></p> To understand why we are concerned I would invite the House to recall certain facts. What has been the reason, since the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance of 1936, for the presence of British troops in Egypt? They are not an army of occupation. That was, as a matter of fact, agreed in the Treaty of 1936. I think it is accepted everywhere. They are there as <span id="850" class="column-number" data-column-number="850"></span> the result of a joint agreement between the Allies for the defence of the Suez Canal. Let me read to the House Article 8 of the Treaty which is the relevant Article. It says this: <blockquote><q>"In view of the fact that the Suez Canal, whilst being an integral part of Egypt, is a universal means of communication as also an essential means of communication between the different parts of the British Empire, His Majesty the King of Egypt, until such time as the High Contracting Parties agree that the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of the navigation of the Canal, authorises His Majesty The King and Emperor to station forces in Egyptian territory in the vicinity of the Canal, in the zones specified in the Annexe to this Article."</q></blockquote> Finally, at the end of the same paragraph, are these words: <blockquote><q>"The presence of these forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation, and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of Egypt."</q></blockquote> That is the Treaty position, accepted by us, accepted by the Egyptian Government and people and accepted by all parties in this House; and I must say that on countless occasions Egyptian statesmen have told me how they thought that was a true basis for the relations of our two countries.<p></p> My first point on this announcement at this time is that it gives the impression, by the manner in which the withdrawal of our troops at this time is referred to, that their purpose there is something other than merely what it is, the defence of the Canal itself. Is it common ground between us, I would ask the Government, that our troops in Egypt are there for one purpose and one only, the defence of the Canal and its security, which has hitherto been regarded as a vital factor in the security of the British Empire? I do not think the right hon. Gentleman will be surprised that we should be astonished that, at the very opening of negotiations, he should propose the withdrawal of our troops, without any explanation as to how the purpose for which they are there, and for which they have been there since 1936, is to be fulfilled when they are withdrawn. That purpose for which they are there, I repeat, is not purely, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, a British one but an Imperial one, an Anglo-Egyptian one, and, I would add, a world one.<p></p> I come to the first question I would ask the right hon. Gentleman: Have the Government satisfied themselves that the de- <span id="851" class="column-number" data-column-number="851"></span> fence of the Canal can be effectively carried out without the stationing of an Anglo-Egyptian force, and without the availability of air and naval bases in Egypt in the vicinity of the Canal? If so, if there is such a plan, if the Government are satisfied that strategically the Canal can be secured without the facilities in Egypt and without the presence of these troops in the Canal zone, will they tell us, and will they tell us what that plan is? If there is not a plan for ensuring the security of the Canal, or any other plan, how, may I ask, in the light of the statement they have just made, do they propose to carry out what is still their obligation under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and ensure the security of the Canal?<p></p> Let me ask another question. Article 8, which I have just read to the House, embodies an agreement between the two Governments, authorising them to station forces in the vicinity of the Canal on Egyptian territory in certain specified zones—I quote again from the Article— <blockquote><q>"until such time as the High Contracting Parties agree that the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entire security of navigation of the Canal."</q></blockquote> Are the Government in the position that they consider that that time has now arrived? Have they been advised, for instance, by the Chiefs of Staffs, that the Egyptian Armies are now in a position to carry out that task? If so, then again there would be grounds which could be explained to the world for this decision. If not, if the Government do not feel that the Egyptian Army is at present in a position to discharge that task, the statement which the right hon. Gentleman made this afternoon seems to me to run directly counter to the terms of the Treaty to which the two Governments agreed in 1936, which this House accepted and which places on the two nations jointly the obligation to defend the Canal.<p></p> Let me say at once that I understand—I have no doubt that it has had an influence in the step which has been taken—the fact that there is an Egyptian national opinion which no doubt, before the negotiations, during and afterwards, will make itself definitely felt. I should not have been at all surprised if the Government had thought it right to make <span id="852" class="column-number" data-column-number="852"></span> it plain at this moment that they did not propose, for instance, to maintain forces in Cairo itself. I could have understood that, and, in the circumstances, it might have been a wise declaration to make. I do not know whether I make myself plain to the House. I say that this is quite a different proposition which the right hon. Gentleman has put before us today. The issue of security of the Canal is still a matter which concerns us and cannot be ignored or prejudged, however strong Nationalist feeling may be. The Prime Minister's statement can only appear to the world to prejudge it before negotiations have taken place at all. On the score of Egyptian national opinion I have one or two other things to say. I must pay tribute to the help and collaboration we received from all Egyptian Governments of whatever party, including the Wafd under Nahas Pasha, in the very bad days before El Alamein. We received help from them during the war in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. However those Governments were composed, they did that; but, after all, our own contribution to Egypt was not altogether negligible.<p></p> Suppose, I ask our Egyptian friends, that Mussolini and Hitler had succeeded in their plans; what opportunity would there be for Egyptian nationalist aspirations to find expression? One has only to read the story of Europe under Hitler's rule, and, let me add, the story of the Senussi under Mussolini's rule, to understand the fate of conquered people under those rules. So I say that while we have obligations to Egypt which I would be the first to recognise, it is not unreasonable to say that, however intense national feeling about the presence of foreign troops on Egyptian soil today may be, it should take some account of recent history. The truth is—and I must say I thought this truth was as well understood in Egypt as it is here—that the interests of our two countries are as one. It may be unwelcome to Egyptian national sentiment to see British troops moving about Cairo. That is unwelcome and could be met. But what have the right hon. Gentleman and the Government done? So far as we can see from the statement made today, before the negotiations have got under way, they make a declaration of withdrawal which, unless some new strategical discovery has been made, makes the new agreement which the right <span id="853" class="column-number" data-column-number="853"></span> hon. Gentleman will conclude quite worthless—[An HON. MEMBER: "Why?"] I will tell the hon. Gentleman. So far as we have been able to judge up to date, from the advice we have had, the presence of some troops in Egypt, not necessarily in Cairo, is called for for the effective defence of the Canal. That is set out in the Treaty of 1936<p></p> I have never heard it challenged. I have never heard any Egyptian statesman I have spoken to object to troops in Egypt. The right hon. Gentleman knows the service of Alexandria as a naval base for us during the war. I have never heard any Egyptian statesman say the presence of British troops in Egypt is unthinkable. I have heard them say, "We do not like your troops in Cairo; we would like them out of the Citadel." That is a concession that might well have been made, but the concession the right hon. Gentleman has made seems to me to make it physically impossible for the Government to come to an arrangement now which will enable us to carry out our obligation unless, as a result of this, he thinks the Egyptians themselves will later on come and say, "We welcome your gesture, but you can keep your troops in the Canal zone for our joint defence." I do not believe that in a matter of this issue that was the correct method of setting about negotiations.<p></p> I must ask the right hon. Gentleman one more question. This is not a matter in which our own country alone is concerned. The Treaty of 1936 made it very plain that the Canal is an essential means of communication between the different parts of the Empire. Can the right hon. Gentleman assure us tonight that the Dominion Governments were consulted before this announcement was made and that they agreed to its terms and to its timing? I need not remind the House that Australia, New Zealand and South Africa all made matchless contributions in blood and effort—[An HON. MEMBER: "And India"]—for the defence of the Canal. I have chosen particularly the self-governing Dominions who are in conference here in London. Of course, the contribution of India was also magnificent. Do they agree with what has been said and done? I can understand the right hon. Gentleman's desire, and I do not quarrel with it, to try to bring about a favourable atmosphere for his negotiations, but the whole <span id="854" class="column-number" data-column-number="854"></span> purpose of negotiations is to secure the future defence of what is an Anglo-Egyptian interest—the security of the Canal. But the right hon. Gentleman and the Government have determined on some other means of defending the Canal. If these means have been approved by our Chiefs of Staff and by the Governments of the Dominions, the House ought to be told. I am bound to say that if that is the answer I shall be so much gratified that we shall congratulate ourselves on having provided the occasion for the right hon. Gentleman to give the information, but if there is no alternative proposal, we cannot but condemn an act which appears to place in jeopardy an essential artery of our Imperial life at the very outset of the negotiations.<p></p> I should myself have been very ready to do anything I could to meet Egyptian opinion so long as such action did not prejudice not only Egyptian obligations but our obligations under the Treaty to defend the Canal, which is also, let me add, our Imperial duty. People sometimes speak as though there was something anti-Egyptian in, for instance, the stationing of British troops in some part of Egypt to defend the Canal. That is not so. The defence of the Canal is an Anglo-Egyptian interest. The Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, I submit to the right hon. Gentleman, has stood the test of time and the still sterner test of war. I have heard innumerable tributes to it paid by Egyptian statesmen of all parties. I regret that, so far as I can judge from the right hon. Gentleman's statement today, the fundamental principles of that Treaty appear to have been thrown over without any substitute being provided in the interests of this country, of Egypt and of the Empire.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">His Majesty's Government are as concerned as anyone else with the security of the communications of the British Commonwealth and Empire, with the security of the Canal, and with the best possible relations with Egypt and the continuance of our alliance with that country; and it is precisely for that reason that we are making the approach that we are making. Let me record briefly a little bit more of the history of our relations with the Egyptian people. They have sometimes been good; sometimes not so good. I can recall the course of those relations over <span id="855" class="column-number" data-column-number="855"></span> a good many years in this House. I remember very well the efforts that were made to try and get an agreement when Mr. Arthur Henderson was Foreign Secretary, and that nearly succeeded in 1929. A difficult period followed after that.<p></p> dThe right hon. Gentleman was successful in 1936 in obtaining the existing Treaty to which he has referred. Conditions in 1936 were different from conditions in 1929. The world was already becoming clouded with aggression. Mussolini was on the move. The right hon. Gentleman therefore—I am not trying to run down in the least what he did—would agree that the position was more favourable at that time. This Treaty did open, as the right hon. Gentleman has stated, with the statement that military occupation of Egypt was at an end. That statement came after a great many years that we had been in Egypt. We had said we were going long ago and we had not gone, and one must remember that those things do remain in the minds of the Egyptian people. The provision then was for the protection of the Canal zone and the stationing of troops there, and the evacuation of our troops from Cairo.<p></p> As the right hon. Gentleman has rightly said, the presence of foreign troops in a capital does offend national sentiment. As a matter of fact the condition for building barracks in the Canal zone was not carried out. The war came and our troops had to be in Egypt, we had to be in Cairo, we had to build up great installations, and we are still in Cairo. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that troops from this country, from India, and from the Dominions rendered a great service to Egypt in saving her from the aggression of Mussolini and Hitler. That is quite true, and it should be in the minds of all Egyptians, but it does not alter the fact that there is the continued presence of troops in Cairo, and elsewhere in Egypt, which does affect Egyptian nationalist sentiment, and it is perfectly understandable.<p></p> That is the fact, and that is where suspicion comes in, that although we have said we shall be going, we have not been able to go. It is quite true that the war intervened and we could not do it. The fact remains that there is that suspicion, which we want to dissipate—the idea <span id="856" class="column-number" data-column-number="856"></span> which is strong in Egyptian minds still that we want to occupy that country. We are seeking for a treaty of friendship, a treaty of alliance, and the strength of a treaty of alliance does not rest on standing out on the terms of some written document, but on the feelings of real friendship which you can have among the peoples.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I beg pardon, the right hon. Gentleman was referring to a later treaty; I thought it was the 1921–22 Treaty. But I should say that even those ports would have been of little use to us if, as a matter of fact, it had led to strong hostility among the people of the country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That is, I believe, the fact. We are proposing this, first of all, because in the preliminary exchanges of views which have taken place between the British and Egyptian negotiators, and on the basis of the advice which we have received from all those who are in a position to give us advice, or very well qualified by long knowledge of Egypt—all the advice given to us has convinced us that in order that the alliance should continue with the same mutual confidence and success as in the past, it is essential to take as the departure the complete freedom and independence of Egypt.<p></p> But, and here is the point, Egyptians do not consider that that freedom is theirs as long as foreign troops are retained, even by a treaty, on Egyptian soil. That is the state of mind that we find in Egypt, and we are satisfied that our proposal to the Egyptian Government really offers us the best means of getting agreement with them on the facilities which we shall need on Egyptian soil to make the alliance a reality, and to enable us in case of emergency to come effectively to Egypt's assistance. We wish, in fact, to treat Egypt in every way as an Ally and as an equal, whose interests are identical with our own, and we want to have Egyptians and ourselves having complete mutual confidence.  <span id="857" class="column-number" data-column-number="857"></span> It is our intention that in the new alliance the principle of joint responsibility in the event of war or emergency for the defence of Egypt, the defence of the Canal, should be upheld. After all, the defence of Egyptian soil is, first and foremost, an Egyptian responsibility, but it is the duty of His Majesty's Government, as an Ally of Egypt, to come to Egypt's assistance in the exercise of this responsibility and to have the facilities that will enable it to do so. That was, as a matter of fact, the position that the 1936 Treaty contemplated, that in a period of years the Egyptian Forces themselves would be able to defend the area, and our retention in the Canal zone of troops was until Egypt could defend herself.<p></p> I am perfectly alive to the fact that under conditions of modern warfare we can only carry out our obligations if we have been put in a position by the Egyptian Government to bring our Forces into action in the area without loss of time in an emergency——</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Yes, certainly. What we are endeavouring to work out with the Egyptians is how we can best get those facilities; how, and in what time, it will be possible to withdraw our troops and get rid of the very large installations that we have there; and how, with them, we can arrange to carry out our obligations for the defence of the Canal. I entirely agree with what the right hon. Gentleman has said about our responsibility in this matter, and we are trying to arrange the best possible way of fulfilling our responsibilities. That can only be done with the hearty good will of the Egyptian people, and in this matter the period of the withdrawal of our Forces will be a matter to be worked out by experts. It depends on physical and administrative factors.<p></p> The future arrangements by which we shall come to the help of Egypt again will have to be worked out, but I am certain that this is the best approach. That is the advice we have received. [An HON. MEMBER: "From whom?"] I cannot give a list of people. We have been depending on the advice of—[An HON. MEMBER:"Laski?"] I was not intending to give a list. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air is accompanied by both civilians and soldiers with <span id="858" class="column-number" data-column-number="858"></span> great experience of these problems. We have discussed this matter with the Chiefs of Staff, who are, naturally, supporting this step. We have discussed it with the Dominion Prime Ministers [An HON. MEMBER: "Did they agree?"] They agreed that this was the best method of approach. After weighing all the factors as to what was the best way in which we could come to an agreement with Egypt in this matter, they have agreed that this is the best way of approach. Fortunately we had the Dominion Prime Ministers' representatives over here, and we have discussed with them, perfectly clearly, why we are doing this, what we are doing, and what is our endeavour.<p></p> Our endeavour is to deal with this matter as between equal, sovereign States, working out things together for our mutual advantage, and not standing on the letter of any treaty, though if the whole matter breaks down, there is still, of course, the 1936 Treaty. But we are trying to get a revision which will be mutually satisfactory to all of us, and I am convinced that we cannot hope to make a successful treaty unless we enter into it in the right atmosphere. All the evidence we get is that a clear declaration to clear up doubts as to our position was the right way of approach, I hope this is going to be as successful as the approach made by the right hon. Gentleman in 1936.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">May I begin by congratulating the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) on the speech he has made? It was a wisely phrased and statesmanlike speech, recognising that so much will depend on the negotiations, the success of which we all hope will be achieved. I hope that the rest of this Debate will be conducted in that same quiet atmosphere and that same sense of deep responsibility.<p></p> Without a doubt the Government have taken a very grave and serious step. Let us see wherein we are agreed. First, we are all agreed that Egypt shall be treated as an equal sovereign State. Secondly, we are all agreed that it is necessary to protect the canal, not merely because it is the waterway between the British Commonwealth and Empire and the home country, but because it is also today and has been throughout, an international waterway open to the whole world. We have taken upon ourselves the heavy duty of its protection and defence. It is because we have taken on that very duty that we have this abnormal position which has existed for a long time, namely, that we have had the duty of its protection though it passes through Egyptian soil. The presence of an Army of ours upon the soil of Egypt is not compatible with the sovereignty of Egypt. What we are all anxious about is that the situation shall be preserved in the way in which the Prime Minister expressed it. We are all anxious that there shall continue to be a close alliance between Egypt and this country.<p></p> The Government have taken a great step, an act of faith that the Egyptian people will recognise their great obligations to this country. Not merely in the <span id="860" class="column-number" data-column-number="860"></span> recent war, but for a period of well over 60 years, this country has not only shed its blood on behalf of Egypt, it has given of its very best, its scientists and its leaders. What Egypt owes to Lord Cromer can never really be estimated. We have turned a large part of the desert into a fair and flowery land. Without a doubt Egypt is under a great obligation to this country. What one is anxious about is how this situation can be preserved with this waterway, international as it is, and a close alliance between the Egyptian people and ourselves. It can only be done when there is complete good will on both sides. What I am so much afraid of is that there is arising in Egypt a national sentiment which feels itself affronted by the fact that our soldiers are on Egyptian soil and Egyptians will not be appeased unless we not only make a definite promise, but a definite move towards showing them that we acknowledge their complete sovereignty over their own land.<p></p> Might I remind the House that on several occasions in the past, from somewhere about 1881 or 1882 onwards, we did promise to evacuate our troops from Egypt, but they remained there? Probably circumstances proved too strong for us as circumstances did prove too strong with the advent of the war. No doubt there is among Egyptians a certain suspicion. It is right that we should do our utmost to dispel that suspicion. What I am hoping is that nothing will be done to jeopardise the safety of that international waterway.<p></p> We have for so long undertaken the policing of the world and undertaken grave responsibilities that, surely, now they might be shared by some others and not entirely borne by ourselves. The Canal is not the only problem; the whole position in the Middle East is an extremely delicate one at the present moment and we are all anxious for a settlement to be arrived at which will lead to an altogether better and happier situation. I was hoping the Prime Minister or the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington would say something about the Sudan. Perhaps the Leader of the House will mention it when replying. We must recognise that all these matters are linked together, the position of Egypt, the Sudan, the Canal, and our friendliness towards all nations. I hope <span id="861" class="column-number" data-column-number="861"></span> that with this gesture, which we have made, it will lead to a better and wiser situation and even a firmer and more permanent treaty between us. In no circumstances whatsoever can I see us coercing Egypt into accepting anything, and I certainly would be no party to that. Agreement must be arrived at voluntarily by free and equal countries.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I have no doubt that many Members on the benches opposite, especially those who are going out, are saying to themselves, "Here is an old blimp coming to give us his dreary strategic views on this subject." [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I am glad to win such easy applause at the start of my oration. I am afraid hon. Members opposite might not be so satisfied at my subsequent remarks. My fears that I might be called a blimp were reinforced by a meeting I had in the Lobby with the hon. Member for Northampton (Mr. Paget), who appeared quite convinced of my stupidity and his own competence regarding his somewhat fatuous strategic views.<p></p> There is nothing new about this subject of the withdrawal of our troops from Egypt. It has been discussed <em>ad nauseam</em> in the very highest quarters. I must be careful of not taking undue advantage of my own position, but I can say that strategically, up to the time that I had anything to do with this matter, the withdrawal of all troops from Egypt was indefensible. It may be that some new event has occurred of which I do not know, but politically I have not heard of such an event. Politically it has not been apparent from the recent situation, so one is forced into the view that the Government have gone against the opinion of what I might term the four greatest experts on this subject of defence in the country, namely, the three Chiefs of Staff and my right hon. Friend the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill).</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not think me, as a new Member, impertinent, if I say that that is not the matter I was discussing. My point was whether the Chiefs of Staff had concurred that we should take troops out of Egypt; it was not the matter of approach. It may be that on discussion of the matter of approach they would agree. My point is the withdrawal of the troops from Egypt.<p></p> Furthermore, as well as the Chiefs of Staff, there has also arisen the question of the Dominions. Again, I was not quite sure as to their position. It is my experience that when one is not quite clear about someone's answer, there is very often a good reason for its obscurity. I would feel a great deal happier on this subject if I felt that the calibre on the Government Front Bench was anything like equal to the calibre on our Front Bench. [AN HON. MEMBER: "That has been decided for you."] No one could ask the electorate to vote for strategic omniscience. A very grave and serious step has been taken, and one wishes to be quite sure that it has been taken with a full knowledge of the repercussions. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are no doubt quite certain on that point, but I would say that this machine, which is the British Empire, which the Government have taken over, is closely knit and intricate. When one takes over a vast machine, such as some hon. Gentlemen may have seen in some power stations, and one does not know much about it or have a great respect for it, if one decides to jettison some part of it, one usually consults an expert engineer. Suppose the expert said, "I think you should hold on to that part;" one should think carefully about the subject. [<em>Interruption.</em>] Hon. Gentlemen opposite keep interrupting me. I wonder if they realise why they are sitting in such a large House of Commons, why they represent such a great Empire? Do they realise that it has been carefully built up, over many years, by men who have studied this subject, worked for it and died for it? Here is this great machine <span id="863" class="column-number" data-column-number="863"></span> for which they have worked. I gained the impression that hon. Gentlemen opposite, possibly through ignorance, would toss it away.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I congratulate the hon. Member on a remark which is absolutely true, but through Egypt runs the artery of the Empire. Does the hon. Gentleman think that we can afford to have this rather weak Power dominated from elsewhere, and see the artery squeezed? I advise him to buy an atlas, and have a good look at it.<p></p> I do not wish to detain the House much longer. [<em>Interruption.</em>] Hon. Gentlemen opposite are paying me a great tribute, because I have a feeling they are not enjoying themselves very much this evening, and are showing it. Around Egypt there are great British interests, Iraq—big oil source—the Sudan, Palestine. If these interests are left lying about—[<em>Laughter</em>]—they will be picked up. Hon. Gentlemen opposite laugh, but when I was at school anybody who left money about was punished, because it was a temptation put in other people's way. I often wonder whether some right hon. Members on the Front Bench opposite have had much experience of the Middle East, and whether they realise the mentality of the people with whom they are dealing. There has been a great deal of speculation in the Middle East about the British, and a great many people in the bazaars have said, "I wonder if the British are done, I wonder if they are finished?" [An HON. MEMBER: "Hitler said that."] I wonder if this particular move will encourage there the feeling that we are as good and strong as ever we were?<p></p> I do not know whether right hon. Gentlemen on the Front Bench opposite have ever bought a carpet in Cairo. If not, I would tell them that when one goes into the shop, the gentleman there says, "Would you like a carpet?" and one says "Yes." He says, "This carpet is £100." The next step is for one to say "I will give you £5 for this carpet." [<em>Laughter.</em>] Hon. Gentlemen opposite may laugh at this, but if they go to the Middle East they will find that it is so. My feeling is that in this Treaty question, <span id="864" class="column-number" data-column-number="864"></span> the Prime Minister, instead of gradually coming up to a settlement, has said at one, "I will give you £100 for the carpet," to the astonishment, not only of this side of the House, but of the whole of the Middle East.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">It seems to me there is one question asked by the right hon Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) which must be answered. It was a most important question and much depends upon the way in which it is answered. He asked whether we could secure the Canal if our troops were withdrawn from Egypt. I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman in return whether he feels we could secure the zone of the Canal if our troops remained in Egypt. I am sure it is within his knowledge that when our troops were withdrawn under the agreement to the Canal zone they were stationed on a narrow strip of land between Port Said, Ismailia and Suez, a most unenviable position. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the Canal itself does not mean a thing. It is only important if it is a navigable piece of water. If our troops are in a position to defend the Canal then there is surely something in the suggestion put by the Opposition that our troops should not be withdrawn. But are they in such a position when in the Canal zone, or even in Egypt, to defend that stretch of water? I suggest that it is extremely doubtful. They are in no better position to defend the Canal by sitting in Egypt than they would be if they were 200 or 300 miles away in Palestine, or further still in Iraq, or in fact not on that continent at all</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I do not think the hon. and gallant Gentleman needs to be reminded that the Canal is not at Alexandria. I am not at all sure whether Alexandria could be used by the Fleet if a first class hostile Power was attacking Egypt. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I do not wish to get into an argument. I think this question will have been answered by me if I say—and presumably I have the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff with me—that we do not need our troops in Egypt in order to protect the Canal. <span id="865" class="column-number" data-column-number="865"></span> If that is so, surely this agitation over the withdrawal of our troops is not very sincere or not very sensible. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington concluded a treaty with Egypt 10 years ago when there was every reason for us to have troops in Egypt. Do those same reasons exist today? I suggest they do not exist in any shape or form. Ten years have elapsed and we are now in the air age. It is solely a matter of aircraft putting the Canal out of action irrespective of millions of troops who may be in Egypt. They could not prevent that act from taking place.<p></p> During part of the last six years we have seen that the Canal was of very little use to us, especially in 1941 and 1942. If it was of little use to us then, surely it would be of little use to us if we had a hostile Power attacking Egypt and we had behind us the Egyptians who were unfriendly towards us and who wished us to go. I suggest that if we are to have troops in any part of the world we should have troops in sufficient numbers to retain our prestige. We should not put our troops in those countries where they are not wanted, or not in sufficient strength to be of very much use. We must approach this problem from an entirely new angle. We should take our troops away from these countries and concentrate our forces. If we must have these forces, let us have them concentrated in friendly lands where they can be used with effect. We should not put them into hostile countries where they are not wanted, and where they could never operate with success. The question asked by the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington was whether we could defend the Canal if our Army was taken away. My answer is we could never defend it even if our Army were there.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Despite the statement of the Prime Minister, we are still deeply concerned about the action which the Government have taken. It is better that we should say frankly why we are concerned. In the course of his speech the Prime Minister stressed that he was seeking an approach to the solution of a problem. It was always the approach to a situation to which he referred. He said it was in that approach that he was supported by <span id="866" class="column-number" data-column-number="866"></span> the Chiefs of Staff, and by the Dominion Prime Ministers. Very great importance should be attached to that. It was in the approach to the problem that he secured the assent and approval of the Chiefs of Staff and of the Dominion Prime Ministers. It was an approach to what? That is the point where, I confess, I was left uneasy after the Prime Minister had spoken. The Prime Minister indicated that he sought an approach to a situation, in which he said we should get facilities which we required to carry out our obligations. Later, he explained that he meant our obligations for the defence of the Canal. It was a comfort to hear that, apparently, there is no question of relaxing from our responsibilities in that connection. It would appear that the Government are determined, as have been all previous Governments, to defend the Canal. That is comforting. Until yesterday no single authority, military or strategic in the last 50 years would have declared that to discharge that responsibility, military and naval forces from Britain placed upon Egyptian soil were not vital. Until 1945, that was undoubtedly the view of every high officer and strategic authority in this country and elsewhere. No one will deny that.<p></p> What has happened since last year—when the war was still raging—to alter the confirmed view of the experts on this matter? The Government ought to tell us what has happened to change the views of all those upon whom the Coalition Government depended for advice. If the situation has changed, the Government ought to tell us the alternative plan which they have in mind. If indeed we are now to withdraw all troops from Egypt within, presumably, a reasonable time, then what other plan is being prepared to take the place of the present one? The Prime Minister has not said a word about the time. Is it twenty-five, five or two years? Suppose it is two years. If it is two years within which every British soldier, sailor and airman is to be withdrawn from Egypt, then what other plan is being prepared? That is the question put by my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden). Hon. Members, speaking for the country, are concerned to know that the Government have a plan and are not just at the stage of an approach without any plan.  <span id="867" class="column-number" data-column-number="867"></span> That is what frightens those of us who sit over here, if I understand the temper of the House. I appreciate the sentiments of the Prime Minister in making his announcement. Indeed, he may be right in his summary of the situation, but I am not to know. He cannot expect us to change our opinions from those which the country has held for half a century all of a sudden like this, without being told what is to take the place of the traditionally British plan for the defence of the Canal. Unless the Government can tell us that an alternative plan is on paper, or is being prepared, and is to be made part of a treaty, I say that the Government are taking a step of the utmost danger for the safety of the Empire and Middle East.<p></p> One last word. Whether one likes it or not, and I have no doubt that hon. Members opposite will not like it, is it not the fact that our relations with other Powers during the last year have steadily deteriorated? [HON. MEMBERS: "No, no."] That is the truth. We are at loggerheads with almost every nation in the world. [HON. MEMBERS: No, no."] Of course, the Government's supporters will deny that, but it is true, and nowhere are we in more unhappy relations than in the Mediterranean area. Nowhere is there more immediate danger pending——</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Stewart) said the Government should explain to the House what changes have taken place since last year to bring about a change of approach to this problem. I can think, without very much research, of four great changes <span id="868" class="column-number" data-column-number="868"></span> —a minor one, a change of Chiefs of Staff; a major one, the arrival of the atomic bomb; a very great one, thank heaven, a change of Government in this country; and, with that change of Government, a feeling that all these problems must be approached from an entirely different angle. I leave it at that. The hon. and gallant Member for Carshalton (Brigadier Head)—and I do not wish to push his speech to one side—was speaking as a soldier, and I understand his anxieties, but I feel that, at this stage in human affairs——</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I know all about the hon. and gallant Gentleman's background. The House will not be under any delusion; it is the background of a soldier. I am sure that the House will agree with the sentiments expressed by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. C. Davies) that the approach for which all of us wish, is that nothing should be done in any way to endanger our relations and friendship with our Egyptian friends. I speak as one who has been to Egypt a good many times in the last 25 years—except when I was prevented by the Gestapo of this country. I know the Egyptians well, and I can tell the hon. and gallant Gentleman that what is said here tonight will not, I think, be regarded as in any way criticism of our friendship with the Egyptians or of their friendship with us. We are seeking a solution which will benefit us mutually, and will lead to lasting cooperation between us.<p></p> I wish the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) were here, because I wanted to address most of my remarks to him. As the former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the right hon. Gentleman naturally speaks with great authority, and he expressed anxiety whether negotiations were <span id="869" class="column-number" data-column-number="869"></span> going on in a spirit of—I think he said—cordiality and good will. I can only offer him, if he wants an assurance from a humble back-bencher, the conviction, from the sort of communication I have had, that they are going on with the utmost cordiality and good will.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Well, my hon. Friend would not expect me to say that. I will certainly give him privately the name of the person who said it. The main thing, surely, is that we should dispel any form of suspicion of our actions. I hope the House realises the great help that Egypt was to us during the war. I have heard Egypt criticised for not declaring war, and have done my best to explain that the worst possible thing that Egypt could have done, from our point of view, was to declare war. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) will agree that the best service that Egypt could have rendered to us was to stay neutral, in the circumstances in which she found herself at the time. The best way in which we can keep ourselves on good terms with the Egyptians is by invisible chains. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington said he could understand that it was thoroughly objectionable to a sovereign State to have other troops stationed in its capital. True, it was objectionable to the Egyptians to have troops in Kasr el Nil barracks and in the Citadel, but how long had the present Opposition been in power before us, and how many times had it been represented to them that the best thing to do to improve relations between Egypt and this country, was to clear out our troops entirely from Cairo? Yet they took no action. They did nothing at all about it, despite the representations of everybody who knew anything about the situation in Egypt</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I know that perfectly well. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."] I am not going to withdraw. There was no real effort by the British Government to support the Egyptian Government in getting the troops out of Cairo. In point of fact, hon. Members did not want them to get out of Cairo, and anybody who knows anything about Anglo-Egyptian relations in Cairo will support me in what I say. Then we hear this talk about the defence of the Canal.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">That is not a very good argument. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington said that the annoying thing to the Egyptians was the continuance of the troops in Cairo. I agree with him, and if he looks up his file he will find a memorandum from me on the subject. If that was the thing that stung all the time—and it did sting—why were not greater efforts made to get the barracks built and to get the troops out?</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford ought to have that knowledge. Then the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington pointed out that it is our obligation to carry out the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and asked how could we do it if troops were withdrawn. To me the answer is simple. I feel that the Government's approach to this matter is the right one, namely, that we can only carry out our obligations under the Treaty by good will and cooperation. With all the hullabaloo and talk that have been going on all over the world about withdrawing troops from one area to another, the best gesture we can make to our Egyptian friends is to say that we are willing to withdraw our troops. Having done so, I would say to them, "You are incapable of defending the country yourself." Having made that gesture, I would say: "We shall now"—as the Prime Minister said—"as equal friends, discuss with you how best to carry out our joint obligations."<p></p> It is no use playing about with this matter. The Dominion Prime Ministers have agreed and the Chiefs of Staff have agreed. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh no."] Yes they have; the Prime Minister said so most emphatically at the beginning of his speech. I happen to have been in touch today with a very responsible person—I am not going to mention his name, but I will gladly give it to the Leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford—who, having listened to the Prime Minister's statement in the House today, left a note for me. If I may, without boring the House—he is a hard-bitten Tory—I would like to read his note. He wrote: <blockquote><q>"Thank God we have for once got a Government which is prepared to do the right thing and let the rest follow. For 60 years and more we have been promising to get out of Egypt. We taught them to be politically minded: we taught them the ideal of independence. Today's announcement is the only logical and honest outcome."</q></blockquote><span id="872" class="column-number" data-column-number="872"></span> I entirely agree with that. I am not prepared to give the gentleman's name because he is at present resident in Cairo. I would conclude by saying that I feel, as one who has Egypt's interest very closely at heart and who is at one with the rest of his Party in not wishing to see the British Empire disrupted, that the best way of maintaining our relations with Egypt, and of seeing that the line of communication through the Canal is preserved, is by the action which the Government have undertaken.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">It is on the matter of the political approach to which the Prime Minister has made reference that I want to say a word or two, but I do not wish to say any word which will make negotiations, which are of a nature that must always be difficult, more difficult. But speaker after speaker, when pressed by questions and interruptions, has fallen back upon the argument that the Prime Minister had said that the Dominions and the Chiefs of Staff had agreed. The right hon. Gentleman who winds up for the Government should make it abundantly clear to this House and the country what exactly were the terms of reference upon which the Chiefs of Staff were asked to given an opinion. This is vitally important. It is not the function of the Chiefs of Staff to give political opinions; it is not right to ask them for political opinions, and it would be shameful if any Minister sheltered himself behind the political opinions of military experts. May we have a categorical answer to whether they were asked if this was advisable strategy for our country and Empire or if they were asked whether it was a wise political approach? If they were asked the latter question, that was wrong, and I for one would not value their opinion. They are not politicians; they are soldiers, men of affairs, strategists. Can we be told what question they were asked?<p></p> In answer to a shrewd question by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill), the Prime Minister said it was time we shared this responsibility. We have had enough trouble, he said, policing the world, and it is time we shared the responsibility. In the same wise way we are seeking to share the responsibility of Palestine, no doubt. But with whom are we shar- <span id="873" class="column-number" data-column-number="873"></span> ing this responsibility? If we promised to get out when we could share the responsibility with someone else who was in a position to help us share it, that would be more convincing. With whom are we to share it? If we do not share it with the Egyptians, with whom are we to share it, and must we not be there before trouble breaks out? It is no good being there after the trouble begins. There will be no Alamein if that is the situation. If we are to share it with U.N.O., would it not be wise to wait until U.N.O. is possessed of unanimity and power and the goodwill of mankind? Would we not be wise to consider these things before giving up this vital interest?<p></p> I have just come back from a visit to South Africa, a country that I knew in my childhood days and which I have visited many times since. I cannot but believe that this action will cause the most profound stir in the minds of South Africans of all shades of political opinion. In the Colonies, surely, the distress will be even greater, because they have not yet developed that sense of self-responsibility which some of the Dominions have developed. But in South Africa and Australia there is a sense of self-responsibility, a sense of having their own Army and their own power. They may, perhaps, exaggerate the strength of it, but they at least have it to come to them. There would be very great distress among His Majesty's dependent people all over the world at the news that the Labour Government are beginning to unbutton the British Empire.<p></p> It may be that the coming of the atomic age has changed the strategy of the past 50 or 100 years. May we examine that for a moment? It may be that what we should defend now and henceforth is not so much the Canal as Durban. We may be able to defend Durban against attacks by atomic weapons because it is a very long way for them to get there. We may be able to intercept them on the way, though I do not doubt that before very long they will go there by rocket, which, hitherto, we have not been able to stop. However, if as an alternative there is a proposal to defend Durban it will be helpful, because the moment the Mediterranean is closed Durban becomes the most important port so far as our communications with our Empire are concerned. <span id="874" class="column-number" data-column-number="874"></span> I know it is not possible for the Prime Minister, being the Chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, to tell us all the secrets which they must be studying from day to day, but I think we should be given some kind of assurance. Surely, whatever the atom bomb may hold for the future, it is so devastating that there will be many stages of trouble, difficulty and uneasiness before one imagines that it will come to be used. During those stages, in places where the trouble is coming and at places from which one can operate when the trouble does come, men standing sentinel are surely necessary. I feel that throughout this country and the Empire there will be the greatest possible sense of anxiety at what apparently has been thrown away by the Prime Minister at the beginning of negotiations. I ask the right hon. Gentleman who is to wind up the Debate if he can relieve that anxiety by lifting the veil a little and explaining to us what exactly is in the Government's mind. In 23 years in this House on and off, I have not heard a Prime Minister so uneasy as the right hon. Gentleman was tonight; nor have I noticed comrades so ill at ease as they were in listening to his statement.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

When he suggests there is great consternation in our Empire and Dominions about a declaration of this kind, I ask the House to take the view of someone else who has had as much experience of the Empire and the Dominions as he has had. I have lived for 34 years in Australia, and I am certain that the people in Australia and New Zealand will welcome the declaration. It is because in the past we, with all the power we have had, have been unwilling to treat other nations as equals that we have come into criticism. The same opinion is to be found in America, Canada and in other parts of the world. The hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Stewart) said that our relations with other Powers have steadily deteriorated. I do not for a moment accept that submission. I have been abroad; I have been five times round the world during the last three years, and I can assure hon. Members that our relations with other Powers are not deteriorating. People in other <span id="875" class="column-number" data-column-number="875"></span> countries will welcome this declaration because they realise that the British Government are going to treat with other people on an equal footing, in a way in which they have not been treated before.<p></p> There are three considerations which lead me to commend this declaration to the House. It is a good thing, and it is essential, if we are to have the faith that we should have in dealing with other nations, that we should deal with them on equal terms. The declaration says to the people and to the Government of Egypt, "We are not going to negotiate with you with an army of occupation in Egypt. We are going to undertake to withdraw it, so that we can now sit round the table and discuss our problems on terms of absolute equality." That is an essential feature of any proper negotiations between States in a modern world. It is entirely in keeping with the Atlantic Charter and the declarations which the Coalition Government made during the war.<p></p> We have always, particularly in the last few years, during the war period, stood for giving equal rights to everyone else to negotiate with us on equal terms. The old principle would have been very applicable, namely, that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. During the present negotiations with the Russians in Paris do we need an Army here while they are proceeding? Surely we want to ensure that these negotiations are carried on in an atmosphere free from any force or any expression of force, or the show of any superior position of any kind. On the ground that it is necessary to have a proper position of equity between Powers negotiating a new treaty I welcome this declaration.<p></p> Let us examine the other question which arises. This evening we have heard a lot about the problem of the defence of the Suez Canal. One would have thought, as a result of this Debate, that the Suez Canal is not to be defended in the future. I do not want to put the matter on a too wide scope, but I look to the day when places like the Suez Canal, the Dardanelles and the Panama Canal are under the United Nations. Strategic places should not be the perquisite of any one Power. I look to the day when Hong Kong goes back to the Chinese, as do many people living in Hong Kong. The <span id="876" class="column-number" data-column-number="876"></span> whole object of the declaration is to enable the British Government and the Egyptian Government to come together and decide the way in which the Canal is to be defended, not in peacetime, when it is not necessary, but in time of war. That is the essential thing.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. and gallant Gentleman has raised a very important question which ought to be answered. If that question cannot be answered I am quite willing to agree with him that we cannot now talk about the defence of the Suez Canal. I do not think it follows that if we withdraw our troops now we cannot make adequate arrangements with the Egyptians to provide for the defence of the Suez Canal. Let us get the problem into its proper perspective. Since the Prime Minister sat down the whole Debate has been on the basis that we are giving up the Suez Canal by withdrawing our troops. Nothing is farther from the truth. The truth is that in order to get a good basis for discussion, in order to meet people on a fair and equal basis, and in order not to give the impression of browbeating or making them feel inferior, we are now about to withdraw our troops That is the problem to be considered here tonight.<p></p> The statement made today by the Prime Minister in the declaration of the Government on this subject did not mean that the defence of the Suez Canal is something in which we are no longer interested. Nothing is farther from the truth. The statement is to the effect that we are interested in the defence of the Suez Canal, and so are the Egyptians. We will talk with them on equal terms so that we can arrive at a decision as to the way in which it can be properly defended. That is the second reason why I suggest this declaration should commend itself to the House. We are not in any sense dealing only with the problem of the defence of the Canal, but are seeking a proper way in which we can come to terms as to the way in which it should be defended.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">It is a perfectly friendly interruption, if I may say so. The hon. Member made the very important point that the Suez Canal should be under the United Nations.

<p class="">I appreciate the question the hon. Gentleman has put. We on this side of the House want to see the terms of the Atlantic Charter carried out to the full. We do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) in this respect. If we are to carry out those terms to the full, I do not think we can say this is a strategic place, that we have a special interest in it and, therefore, that it cannot go to the United Nations. It is because we have got to try and develop the United Nations organisation for the defence of the peoples of the world, and to provide resistance to aggression at any time, that the strategic key points, like the Dardanelles, the Panama Canal, Singapore if you like and, of course, the Suez Canal, are the very places which should come under the United Nations.<p></p> That brings me to the fourth point I want to make. It is a little difficult, but I think it ought to be made. The Debate has disclosed the wide difference that exists between the two sides of the House on this question. I do not for a moment subscribe to what was said, I think by the hon. Member for Lonsdale, that we are now witnessing the break-up of the Empire, or that the present Government want to bring about the breaking up of the Empire. On the other hand, there has been a big change in the position of Britain, and of the British Empire and the Dominions, during the turn of the century and in between the two wars. We are now endeavouring on this side of the House to give India her independence. That is a good thing. I hope, as time goes on, during the 5 or 10 years that this Government will be in office—[An HON. MEMBER: "Twenty years."]—I <span id="878" class="column-number" data-column-number="878"></span> was not going as far as that—I hope that during that period of time we will see other Colonial peoples getting their independence.<p></p> Therefore, we have to look at the whole question of the Empire somewhat differently. The British Dominions do not take the same view as some people in this country take about the problem of Empire. They do not like the fact that some 60 million people, apart from India, are under the Colonial Office. They would like to see them having freedom of the same kind that they enjoy, and it is therefore very important that we should realise the change that is taking place. Hon. Members have been talking about this striking at Imperial bonds, and so on. I wish hon. Members would try to realise for a moment what those Imperial bonds mean. The bonds that are strong are between the free and independent Dominions, not between the Colonial peoples. As a great Conservative told the people at one of the universities recently, the day when the British Empire must be re-orientated, when it must take an entirely different place in world affairs, is coming. Bigness is not greatness, and we do not rely for our important place in the world today on the fact that we have a lot of territory and a lot of people to control. That is not it at all. It is the contribution in political ideas which this country can make to the world which makes its greatness, and the contribution this country is making is the contribution of showing that, by peaceful change, it is possible to secure a real change in the social ownership of the country, brought about by a Socialist Government. It is that which other countries in the world are now beginning to realise, and it is that contribution that we are making today.<p></p> So I ask hon. Members not to think of this problem as one in which, because we are going to discuss how the Suez Canal should be defended, we are striking at the bonds of Empire. We are showing, not for the first time, something which is very necessary to the peoples of the world, because this declaration will be welcomed by liberal-minded people in America and in other parts of the world; we are showing that we are prepared to stand up for the things we have fought for, and to give to other people the freedom which we want for ourselves.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">The hon. Member for North-West Hull (Mr. Mackay) coyly concealed the fact that he was addressing this House for the first time, and I think the best compliment I can pay him is to say that certainly many hon. Members, on both sides of the House, would have been completely unaware of the fact that it was his first speech, had not you, Mr. Speaker, drawn our attention to it. His great fluency, and his obvious sincerity and interest in the subject, will be welcomed as much, perhaps even more, when he comes to address us again.<p></p> Those who have spoken hitherto in this Debate have all claimed some sort of special authoritative knowledge of Egypt. My only knowledge of Egypt is of a very barren part of it, and in a very humble capacity, but I cannot help feeling that the knowledge I gained—a worm's eye view it was, in my own case—enables me to say one or two things about the subject. I feel that this is a rather momentous occasion, and that what we say should be carefully weighed because it will be read later. We should not desire to express a final opinion, either on what has been said this afternoon, or upon the course it is desirable that these negotiations should take. But I must confess myself not altogether reassured by the speech of the Prime Minister, and I think he has only himself to blame, both for the manner of the declaration this afternoon, and for the piecemeal nature of the admissions and assertions which were elicited from him bit by bit in the course of interrogation.<p></p> I feel, however, that there is probably some advantage in trying to define exactly what is in dispute at the present time. This looks like becoming a Party issue. I must say I rather deprecate it, if it is; because I think that the great questions of Imperial defence and foreign policy ought to be subjects, if possible, of agreement between the Parties. We know that that is not always possible, but I feel, at any rate, that if we are to differ, we should know quite clearly what we are differing about. It is not in issue that in these negotiations we are treating with Egypt as a free and equal, independent sovereign State. It does the greatest possible damage to Anglo-Egyptian relations for either side to <span id="880" class="column-number" data-column-number="880"></span> accuse the other of making that assertion. Both sides are agreed that in treating with Egypt we treat with a free, equal, independent sovereign State. That was the basis of the Treaty of 1936 negotiated by my right hon. Friend, and that is the basis of any negotiations which any responsible Party would enter into in this country at the present time.<p></p> Secondly, I thought that some hon. Members opposite were doing another disservice by suggesting that we were wrong in any way to refer to the great and individual interest which the British Commonwealth of Nations must necessarily have in the communications of the Middle East. It was expressly recognised by the Treaty and, as I shall, I think, endeavour to show in a few minutes' time, it is part of His Majesty's Government's present considered policy. It was expressly recognised by the Treaty that the Suez Canal was both an integral part of Egypt, an universal means of communication, and an essential means of communication between the different parts of the British Empire. The special interest of the British Empire in Egypt will, therefore, be recognised by His Majesty's Government, no less than on these Benches. I think some hon. Members opposite have done a real disservice to Anglo-Egyptian relations by suggesting that there is any difference on either side of the House on that point, too.<p></p> Let us see what other points can be agreed upon. In the first place, the Egyptians are perfectly right to expect this country to liquidate its war position—that is to say, the position which was built up during the war—as soon as possible. Obviously, they must be reasonable in their demands. The Treaty provided for 10,000 troops and, I think, 400 pilots, but not a similar number of aircraft; and it is obvious by that it is perfectly legitimate for Egypt, now hostilities are at an end, to ask us to remove our troops from Cairo and to liquidate the war position which was built up with the vast war installations not required for the permanent defence of the Suez Canal. I do not think that that point will be in serious dispute. I think it is also reasonable for the Egyptians to say that the scale of the defence of the Suez Canal in 1936 is not necessarily the scale necessary for the defence of the Canal in 1946; and, therefore, I think we were right in making <span id="881" class="column-number" data-column-number="881"></span> no demur when we heard that the Egyptian Government and His Majesty's Government had entered into negotiations with one another for the purpose of reviewing the Treaty in accordance, as I understood it, though, I think, it was not expressly stated, under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty itself.<p></p> It seems to me reasonable, even though the minimum period of renewal had not yet arrived—the minimum period being 10 years—that both sides should want to look again at their obligations, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty, after the close of hostilities. I do not think there can be any complaint that the Government considered entering into negotiations with that object in view. What is in question is whether the whole approach to this question has been a prudent one, and I cannot myself feel that it has. I cannot altogether rid myself of the feeling that the Government have been oppressed by political considerations of a wrong kind, and have paid too little attention to the strategic considerations. After all, it would not have been to the advantage of Egypt, in the long run, if we had not been adequately prepared in 1939, or, to put it another way, if we had been still more inadequately prepared than we were. After all, if Rommel had got to Alexandria, the war, if it had not been lost, would have been indefinitely prolonged to the infinite discomfiture of Egypt, and to the great sorrow of the world.<p></p> It behoves us to look at this strategic problem as sensible people. I agree with the hon. Member for North-West Hull in one respect. I think it has become abundantly plain, all over the world, that in the various strategic and political problems we have to solve, the purely nationalist solution, whether it is British nationalist, or any other kind of nationalist, is breaking down, and that an international solution of some sort, under U.N.O., is the only solution which is intellectually satisfying, and which, in the long run, is the only one practicable. What are the Government doing here? Is it not that they are appeasing—and I am using the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. C. Davies)—nationalist sentiment in relation to one of the strategic soft spots of the world, at precisely the moment when it has become abundantly plain that a purely nationalist approach is doomed to disaster? Is not that the whole burden of the charge <span id="882" class="column-number" data-column-number="882"></span> against the Government at the present time? The basis of the Treaty, in 1936, was the admitted necessity to defend the Suez Canal from the point of view of the world, of the British Empire and of Egypt, and what was then admitted to be the inability of Egyptian arms to do this—I intend no disrespect for Egyptian arms. They lent us invaluable service during the war, but if the war had no other military lesson to teach us, I should have thought it was that armies of small nations with little or no industrial potential are not able to defend vitally strategic world centres of communication.<p></p> If it were true that in 1936 Egyptian arms were incapable of defending the Suez Canal, and that that justified a military arrangement over and above what Egyptian arms were able to provide, it is still more true in 1946 in the light of recent developments and experience. It is really childish to talk of purely nationalist considerations in this country, or in Egypt, in the face of that vital fact. Friends of hon. Members in this House have died in defence of this place, and some portions of the Desert are as well known to us as portions of our native land. We are abundantly determined not to have to undergo, through want of preparation or through political irresponsibility, such an experience again, which was not an agreeable one, except for those who had no sense of their own safety.<p></p> The world demands a little more from a nation, whether Egyptian or British, than reliance on principles of 19th century independence. The whole approach of His Majesty's Government, at the present time, seems to me to concede the vital point on which international security is bound to break down. They are proposing to go back on the 1936 position that something over and above the Egyptian Army is required to defend the Canal. On this part of the case, I only want to add this: I am not myself convinced that it is possible to improvise bases and installations. I do not think that any large number of troops, in any ordinary sense of the word, is necessary, but some technical staff is probably desirable, and I do not believe that total evacuation is the right formula on which we ought to proceed.<p></p> I have only one other point to make and that is one upon which I hope to receive some reassurance from His <span id="883" class="column-number" data-column-number="883"></span> Majesty's Government. I understand, and I hope that I shall be reassured about it, that these negotiations are proceeding under Article 16 of the existing Treaty. If they are, it is agreed by that Article that any revision of the Treaty will provide for the defence of the alliance between the high contracting parties in accordance with the provisions contained in Articles 4, 5, 6 and 7. I should be obliged if the right hon. Gentleman who is to reply would tell me that, whatever else is jettisoned in these negotiations, no attempt will be made to jettison any one of those four Articles, because it is upon those Articles that the whole structure of our military alliance is based and upon which the whole of the special nature of our interests is realised.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I will coyly admit to the House that I never let Italy get into Abyssinia. I would say, in reply to the hon. Gentleman, that if we are to waste our time making Parliamentary points, the future of this country is not very well secured. The real truth of this matter is that the security of the Suez Canal is a vital interest to the future peace of the world. I do not believe that a purely Nationalist solution is one which will secure the future peace of the world. The solution which must be attained is one which will ultimately lie under the responsibility of U.N.O., and in the discharge of that responsibility bases and installations provided by the British Empire have to play an important and indispensible part.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I am very grateful, Mr. Speaker, that I have caught your eye so soon after returning from an extended absence from the House, much of which was spent in somewhat embarrassing circumstances in the Middle East, and a short part of it in Egypt. In the few minutes at my disposal, I should like to put before the House one or two of my impressions of Egypt, which I think are relevant to this discussion. The Commission on which I was serving happened to arrive in Cairo during the anti-British general strike, and it was requested that we should go from our hotel, just outside <span id="884" class="column-number" data-column-number="884"></span> Cairo, to Cairo, to interview the British Chiefs of Staff, on the day of the general strike. A large convoy of armoured cars was ordered to bring us to Cairo. Then this convoy was cancelled, because it was thought that it would not be safe to take us in armoured cars for fear of disturbances. Whereupon, I was able to arrange to go down to Cairo in a car, with an Egyptian, in perfect safety. That story illustrates the limits to which you can impose on one nation the troops of another nation. Security for us was possible only if we were on terms of individual friendship with an Egyptian and then we were perfectly safe in his charge. In a huge convoy there was an acute danger to life. I believe that that small story is symbolic of the problem we have to face in Egypt at present.<p></p> Hon. Members on the other side of the House have once or twice referred to Egyptian nationalism as though it were something which was important but which might have to be overridden in certain circumstances. My impression of the Middle East is that since 1936 Arab nationalism has grown and completely transformed the situation, and unless we grasp the overwhelming importance of this fact we shall fail completely to establish good relations in the Middle East, which we must do if we are to survive as a nation and as an Empire. I go so far as to say to the House that I am doubtful whether any Treaty could have been negotiated with an Egyptian Government without this prior statement by His Majesty's Government. From the conversations I have had with Egyptian politicians, civil servants, the ordinary man in the street and students, I believe it was absolutely essential. An Egyptian politician would not have dared to put to his own people a Treaty without this prior condition of Great Britain, proving that she was giving not merely lip service to equality, but showing that, at last, there was a Government here which would not merely talk about evacuating troops some time in the future, but was actually prepared to do it. That will create a situation in which I am sure the Egyptians will feel they can negotiate. The hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg) suggested that there was no difference in the House on certain subjects and that there should not be a Division. I could not help thinking that on this subject of equal treatment of other nations and "lesser <span id="885" class="column-number" data-column-number="885"></span> breeds without the law" there does seem to be a difference between hon. Members on this side of the House and those on the other side.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I am grateful to the hon. Member for his observation, but I was trying to point out, in fact, that during the past 20 years a situation has arisen in which no Egyptian could accept the fact of equality as long as British troops were in Egypt. They believe that in those circumstances there could be no such thing as equality. The real test of equality is not whether we feel we are giving equal treatment, but whether others feel that they are being treated equally. The test in Egypt is whether the Egyptian thinks he will be treated on level terms with ourselves, not only now, but in the future. I humbly suggest that as a precondition of these negotiations it was essential to clear this age-long difficulty out of the way not only the troops in Cairo but the troops in Egypt as well.<p></p> May I put a parallel case to the House? Let us take the case of France. France was defeated in the war because her Army did not fight very well. The Germans got to the Channel ports and things were very dangerous for us. If, after the war, we had said to the French that for strategic reasons it was necessary for us to garrison such ports as Dieppe and Calais with 40,000 troops, what would the French have thought? There would be overwhelmingly strong strategic reasons for doing it, but I doubt if, in subsequent negotiations, any Frenchman would think that we were treating his country on an equality. The French would not consider they were being treated equally with us until those troops had been withdrawn. We want the Egyptians to be treated as the French would expect to be treated, namely as an equal nation and not like a "lesser breed without the law."<p></p> In conclusion I should like to congratulate the Prime Minister on what I regard as a really bold and imaginative move. I do not believe its effect will be felt solely in Egypt. I am convinced that throughout the Middle East and the Arab world <span id="886" class="column-number" data-column-number="886"></span> there will be, at last, a feeling that there is a Government which intends to do something about equality. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Hon. Members on the other side laugh at that idea, but it is not a laughing matter. We found in the Middle East that there was a deep sense that Great Britain's policy for the last 20 years had been one of waiting until concessions had to be extracted from her, too late to be genuine generosity, and also so late as to be regarded as appeasement. It is a policy which is absolutely fatal to our Empire and to ourselves, to wait until it is too late and then give way reluctantly at the last moment because we are too weak. It is far better, at the beginning of negotiations, to set the tone of the negotiations, and see whether you can get a genuine relationship of equality between ourselves and the Egyptians, without which no security in the Middle East is possible.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">When I was up at Oxford I had the privilege to be <em>in statu pupillari</em> to the hon. Member for East Coventry (Mr. Grossman), but he never taught me then that appeasement was right. He never taught me in such a muddled way, from the military point of view, that I should apply the same considerations to France and to Egypt, nor did he ever teach me that we should make an assumption in dealing with a vital British interest, that when we were in the course of negotiations with a good Ally we should eventually have to give way, withdraw our troops, and give up the security of what he and I and everyone else have always thought to be one of the most vital links in the British Commonwealth.<p></p> I speak with a little feeling on this matter, engendered by a personal experience (of a worm's eye view) of a kind somewhat similar to that obtained by my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg) in Egypt and the Near East during the dark days of the war. At that time I felt while I was actually fighting, and while I was waiting to fight, the mutual importance to each other, of Egypt and the British Empire. My feelings were also aroused by the memory of many mighty efforts made by men all over the Empire to preserve the security of our base in Egypt, and of our lines of communication from them. I am not unmindful that at this moment His Majesty's Government are conducting <span id="887" class="column-number" data-column-number="887"></span> negotiations, nor am I unmindful of the efforts and labours of statesmen and public servants, both Egyptian and British, to build up a Treaty of Alliance between our two countries in 1936. The problem today is very much as it was in those days, when it was summed up by the then Leader of the Liberal Party, who did not approve of appeasement, in these words: <blockquote><q>"The problem has been to reconcile the principle of Egyptian independence with that of safeguarding the vital interests of the British Empire and lines of communication through the Suez Canal."</q></blockquote> Have the Egyptians learnt to hate us so much as some people would lead us to suppose, have they, in the welling up of their national sentiment, learnt to hate us so much since the days of the war, when we and they together did so much to preserve our common future? The problem of the defence of the Suez Canal is one that has been discussed by several hon. Members, some with military qualifications and some without them. I wish to discuss it without any reference to military qualifications, but simply to mention one or two points which I think are matters of commonsense. It is well worth pointing out that in 1936, both the Egyptian Government—and I believe I am right in saying that the Egyptian signatories of the Treaty represented all parties and all parts of Egyptian life—and this country—and again, it is true to say that in the House all parties approved of the ratification of the Treaty—agreed that, in the words of the Treaty: <blockquote><q>"In view of the fact that the Suez Canal, whilst being an integral part of Egypt, is a universal means of communication as also an essential means of communication between the different parts of the British Empire, His Majesty the King of Egypt, until such time as the High Contracting Parties agree that the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure, by its own resources, the liberty and the entire security of the navigation of the Suez Canal, authorises His Majesty the King and Emperor to station troops in Egyptian territory in the vicinity of the Canal."</q></blockquote> It was recognised how important the Canal was to the future of the British Empire, and through it, to the future of Egypt. But what do we have today? A statement by His Majesty's Government, in connection with the negotiations with Egypt, in which we promise to withdraw our forces from Egypt, and we do not even mention the importance of the Suez Canal. It might be thought that, as a <span id="888" class="column-number" data-column-number="888"></span> result of changing weapons and changing conditions in the world, the Suez Canal itself had become less important for us. No such argument has been put in the House, and, indeed, it would be impossible to sustain such a case after the experiences of 1940–45. Surely, the war showed how important to the future of the Empire is the vast network of communications that has been built up over the centuries, and how important it is to the existence of peace in the world.<p></p> The more we try to knit together the Empire—and I believe it was with this object in view, among many others, that His Majesty's Government called together a conference of Dominion Prime Ministers in this country—the more important, and not the less important, the safety of our communications between the various parts of the Empire becomes. Nor should we forget the base that we were able to build up in Egypt for war purposes. We should not forget how important it was. I do not suggest we should try to keep it as it is now, but I do suggest that the House should think carefully before denying to us the possibility of having such a base if ever again we should be called upon to fight in that area.<p></p> I would like to examine an argument made by the hon. and gallant Member for Derby (Group-Captain Wilcock) who recently left the Air Force; he suggested that we did not make the Canal secure by lining the banks of the Canal with troops. That is obviously true. In modern warfare, one does not achieve security by having troops in only one place, but it would be quite true to say that if we did not put troops anywhere near the Canal, we would indeed be leaving the Canal completely insecure. The putting of them there is one of the necessary, vital things that has to be done in order to achieve any security. I would remind the House that if there has been any change in methods of warfare since 1936 it has been towards speed and mobility at the beginning of any aggressive war, and therefore it becomes more important and not less important that we should have troops near that Canal, otherwise there will be a race, and we shall lose the race.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">This is a problem which we can obviously enlarge upon, but <span id="889" class="column-number" data-column-number="889"></span> surely the hon. Member and the House are concerned here with the defence of the British Empire. We need not consider exactly where the attack is coming from; we would be extremely unwise if we planned our defence only upon the basis of attack from one direction.<p></p> There has been reference to the Treaty, and I should like once again to remind hon. Members that it is part of an agreement. I know the Prime Minister said that we must not stand solely by the words of the agreement and must not base our case upon it alone, but it is worth remembering that the Egyptians freely concluded with this country this agreement in which they said we should remain responsible for the defence of the Canal until the Egyptian Army was capable of carrying it out. I cannot believe that the Egyptian Army or the Egyptian Government would claim at this moment that they are capable of maintaining that defence. It has been said before, but hon. Members, particularly those on the other side of the House, seem to attach too little importance to the words written in the Treaty and to the relative powers of the Army of a small and only recently developed country like Egypt and the armies, air forces, and navies of the large Powers of the world.<p></p> I have been trying to think why it is that His Majesty's Government have issued this statement. Is it an example of His Majesty's Government bowing to the exaggerated demands of over-emotional nationalists? I cannot help thinking that if they take the cries and riots of over-emotional, nationalistically minded students as representative to a large extent of the feelings of Egypt, as the hon. Member for East Coventry appeared to do, they are making a great mistake indeed. If they are going to do that in Egypt are they also going to do it all over the world? If they are, we should have some clear warning. What effect can a statement of such weakness have upon the negotiations which are going on at the moment? How can we maintain the commitments that we are going to take on in the Sudan, and how can we implement the commitments that the hon. Member for East Coventry himself has joined in saying we should continue to hold in Palestine, if we are going to withdraw our troops from this vital connection between the various parts of the Empire? <span id="890" class="column-number" data-column-number="890"></span> I finish by stressing once again the importance of the Empire in this matter. When my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) came to the House to get this Treaty ratified in 1936 he was able to produce a statement by the Australian Government, who at that time had just issued a statement in their Senate, approving the Treaty wholeheartedly. He was able to bring to the House also the verbal approval which had just been given to him by Mr. Nash of the New Zealand Government. We have had no such positive statements from the Prime Minister today. His hesitant replies to the questions that were put to him contrasted poorly with the definite statement that my right hon. Friend was able to make. Surely it is agreed, not only by politicians of the Empire, and not only by historians, but even by Hitler and Mussolini themselves, how important the Canal, and the lines of communication in that part of Egypt, are to us. Surely it was agreed by the millions of soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought to protect it in 1942, in those dark days when it was so severely menaced.<p></p> Surely this House will not go back on all that, and will not forget the vital importance of holding together a strong Empire, from a material point of view. Surely His Majesty's Government will not forget—perhaps "forget" is the wrong word. Perhaps we should say that they are going to rate it at nought—I would appeal to them to reconsider the matter, if there is still. time. Whatever happens in the negotiations, let them stand firm and ensure that the Suez Canal is made really secure.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I rise at this late point in the Debate to support His Majesty's, Government. I believe that the Prime Minister is not facing the kind of situation which the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) was facing in 1936. It is no good the hon. and gallant Member for North Blackpool (Brigadier Low) saying that his right hon. Friend came down with more positive statements to the House. Of course he did. He had concluded a Treaty. The Prime Minister has had to speak with very great caution this afternoon because we are at the beginning of Treaty negotiations. We hardly <span id="891" class="column-number" data-column-number="891"></span> needed the reassurance, because of course the Chiefs of Staffs are well aware of the situation; and the Dominions themselves have not only been made aware of it but have seen the complete draft of the statement. By force of circumstances, my lot has been cast in the city of Cairo for about seven weeks. During that period I visited a great many people who were concerned not only with politics but with the wider field of Egyptian endeavours. I can say to the hon. and gallant Member for North Blackpool that this is not just a matter of students. The hon. Member for East Coventry (Mr. Crossman) was quite right. There is not a politician in Egypt who is not wholly behind the statement made by Sidky Pasha the other day. I would ask the hon. Member for East Fife (Mr. Stewart), who is supporting the Opposition on this occasion, what he proposes to do. How does he propose to meet the situation? With bayonets?</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">I happen to hold the view that there was no necessity for the riots which recently took place. That is not my view only but the view of many soldiers in Egypt today. If we had made even the beginning of a token gesture six months ago there would be a great difference in the feeling today That is the view of the large majority of British people in Cairo at this moment. What is more, we are now concerned in negotiating in difficult circumstances. We are negotiating after a great many unnecessary pinpricks have been given to the Egyptians during the last six or eight months. We are negotiating at a time when, as the hon. Member for East Coventry so clearly said, we have got to look into the mind of the other man and see whether he thinks it is a sovereign State with whom he is negotiating when we have 30,000 to 40,000 troops on his soil.<p></p> When the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington negotiated the 1936 Treaty, I happened to be a junior Member of the Government. I refreshed my memory this afternoon by reading that Debate: It is perfectly true that even <span id="892" class="column-number" data-column-number="892"></span> that Treaty was negotiated under some duress. It was certainly done with the knowledge that there was war impending, and it was never meant to be the last word on the subject. I say that at this moment there is such good will towards this country in Egypt in spite of the riots—the next day our own soldiers are at perfect ease with the Egyptians. There were classes in English going on in the British Institute in Cairo all through the riots; there was no diminution in that attitude of friendliness towards this country. At this moment when in the Arab world we have appeared once again as the liberator and when we have reversed the decision forced on us by Germany—the ancient tradition of our foreign policy—I rejoice that His Majesty's Government have performed what I regard as an act of faith, which a great many people think is the only possible basis for these negotiations and I believe it will be rewarded.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Mr. Speaker, I feel we were right and even bound to invoke the somewhat unused procedure of the House and move the Adjournment, with your permission, under Standing Order No. 8. These great questions which are suddenly opened up before Business without any power or facility or opportunity of debate being offered, place us all in a difficulty, and very often during the war the Opposition—or those who sat on this side, because they hardly called themselves the Opposition—used to say that they would very much appreciate if a Motion were put down at the time such a statement was made. The right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister did not take that course. I am not criticising him for it. He made the statement, and I am bound to say that it caused me a most painful shock, and I think that was the general feeling on this side of the House when he informed us that the Government were proposing, or were intending, or had, in fact, actually proposed to the Egyptian Government the evacuation of all British naval, military and air forces from Egypt. We have, therefore, used our Parliamentary rights. We have been very chary of showing any differences with the Government upon external matters. We are not consulted in any way, but none the less we have given every help we could, often by keeping silent and often <span id="893" class="column-number" data-column-number="893"></span> by not saying how much we approve of their conduct, because that might be no help to them at all. But here was a point where I feel that a very serious division—I did feel, and to some extent still do feel that a really serious division—of purpose and of method divides us.<p></p> It is a very serious thing to begin a negotiation of this character with the statement that you are proposing to give away the main point. I cannot conceive that that is good diplomacy. The Government will say, "Oh, it must be judged by the results whether it is good diplomacy or not," but still that remains: you begin by proposing not merely to move the troops from Cairo—on that we could have easily agreed—but to remove them altogether out of Egypt. Then His Majesty's Government propose to have a long negotiation to see what effective measures can be taken for the defence of the Canal zone, and the Prime Minister—if I understood him rightly because I have not seen the text of his speech, I only heard it—said that if the Canal zone is not effectively protected as a result of the negotiations, we shall revert to the Treaty of 1936. Is that so? Have I rightly interpreted him in that matter?</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">Yes, I see. Then the negotiations are for the purpose of securing a satisfactory defence of the Canal zone in a manner most agreeable to Egyptian sentiment. If they break down, then we revert to the 1936 Treaty. That is a very important admission, and I am bound to say it relieves my anxiety to some extent, but it in no way improves the view which we take of the method by which the Government intend to handle this matter. They begin by saying, "We will withdraw the troops." They go on to say, "If the Canal zone is not properly defended, we revert to the 1936 Treaty with the troops on the Canal zone." But who has ever suggested that there is any method of safeguarding the Canal except by troops in the Canal zone? You will not get any military man of eminence and responsibility to say that the Canal can be kept open—because that is the whole point; it is to keep the Canal open. Anyone can close the Canal from hundreds of miles away; it is to keep it open that we require <span id="894" class="column-number" data-column-number="894"></span> troops on the spot, not only when danger has come but in the months before the storm has burst.<p></p> Look at the position we are now in. We begin by saying, "We are willing to evacuate all our Forces from Egypt." We then say, "Unless satisfactory methods are devised for safeguarding the Canal zone, we revert to 1936 with our troops there." And all the time we know that there is no satisfactory method of keeping the Canal open, and making sure that it is kept open, except by keeping troops there. How, then, is it likely to make a good atmosphere, to remove suspicion, to go and promise at the outset what you know in your heart you will have to take back, or hope will be given back to you during the course of the negotiations?<p></p> I think the negotiations are proposed on a most curious basis. I am greatly relieved to hear the Prime Minister's statement that if you do not get effective defence of the Canal zone, the 1936 Treaty operates again. I do not know that the Egyptians will be so relieved to hear that statement. It seems to me that we have suffered very much indeed from this curious method of what is called "approach." The word "approach" really means "departure"—a good way of expressing it.<p></p> We, therefore, find ourselves forced to part company in this external matter. There are only two other points to which I wish to refer, because the whole case was admirably epitomised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden). There is the question of the Chiefs of Staff and their opinion. The right hon. Gentleman said that they entirely agreed with the approach. Naturally we do not know what took place in these discussions, but I can quite see that it was a very foolish question to put to the Chiefs of Staff. They are not the judges of the diplomatic methods of approach. If the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House, who is to reply, were to say that the Chiefs of Staff expressed the opinion that it was possible to keep the Canal open without having troops in the Canal zone, I am bound to say it would have a very decisive effect on my mind. But one can always put questions to military men which are of a political character and to which they find it difficult to give an answer. <span id="895" class="column-number" data-column-number="895"></span> If we look back on the history of the Irish ports, I think it was in 1937, the Chiefs of Staff were consulted but the form of question put to them was one to which they could only give an affirmative answer. I hope the Leader of the House will tell us definitely if the Chiefs of Staff believed that there is a method of keeping the Canal open without having British soldiers in the Canal zone. If he can say that, I must say I bow—under all reserves—to the opinion of the Chiefs of Staff.<p></p> Then there is the question of the Dominion Prime Ministers. Egypt owes us a great debt. Since the days of Cromer we have done our best to shield her from all the storms which beat about the world. We have done a great deal, though not nearly as much as we ought to have done, to force forward the lot of the fellaheen and the masses of the people. We have been hampered by our respect for the authority of the Egyptian potentates and assemblies and by not wanting to interfere too much in the affairs of the country. But it is a shocking thing how little progress there has been among the great masses of Egyptian fellaheen. I have been mixed up in this Egyptian affair in one way or another for 50 years, and I felt it a most painful blow when the right hon. Gentleman tossed out in five sentences of admirable terseness that all the Forces were to be withdrawn from Egypt. It was most painful. The debt we owe to Egypt is £400 million and that, I suppose, will be the most tangible link between the two countries, the payment of that debt. But the debt which Egypt owes to us is that in two world convulsions she has been effectively defended by Great Britain and not only by this island. The Australians and New Zealanders and South Africans have shed their blood freely to prevent Cairo and Alexandria being looted and ravished, ground down and subjugated, by Italian and German hordes.<p></p> When the Government say that the Dominions are consulted, I wonder very much whether the word "consulted" has been defined with sufficient accuracy for us to base ourselves upon it. Dominion Premiers, or their representatives, are in London. The Prime Minister says they have been consulted. I agree with him in saying that he is responsible. He says, "I take the responsibility." That is <span id="896" class="column-number" data-column-number="896"></span> quite true, but as to the degree of consultation, I do not know. The Chiefs of Staff, in my view, were asked a question which was a political question and gave an answer which did not touch reality. The Dominion Prime Ministers were not consulted in the sense of participating in a discussion which would shape the policy of the Government. They were told what the policy of the Government was after His Majesty's Ministers have, in the proper exercise of their responsibility, arrived at their own conclusion. I am only putting that issue. But if ever there was a question on which the Ministers of South Africa, of Australia, of Canada and of New Zealand should be taken right into the councils of His Majesty's Government it was this question of the handling of the position in Egypt.<p></p> I fear that we cannot leave the matter in mere Debate. We are bound to mark our protest and misgivings at this early stage by a vote. I earnestly hope that this effort of ours to give significance to our proceedings, to make people realise the deadly slope on to which we are getting, not only in Egypt, but in many other countries at the present time, this effort to call a halt, to enlist the keen, patriotic, energetic spirit of men I know on that Bench—this can only be done if, at this stage, and much to our regret, we record, by vote, a definite disagreement on an external matter with His Majesty's Government.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">We have listened with the attention and respect that we always do to the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, and whatever I may say by way of observation, will not in any way derogate from my own or from our admiration and respect for the leadership which the right hon. Gentleman gave in the war. We always listen to him with interest and respect in Parliament, even when he is in a much more combative mood than he has been in tonight.<p></p> I think that today he has gone through three phases. The first was, as he said, a feeling of shock and concern, and even indignation, at the statement which my right hon. Friend found it necessary, and right, in his judgment, to make. I understand that. Then I thought that tonight he began his speech with the intention of being conciliatory, and if I may say so, <span id="897" class="column-number" data-column-number="897"></span> helpful, in a situation which, as everyone will appreciate, is bound to be one of great difficulty. The right hon. Gentleman will be the last to dissent from that observation, because we are at the beginning of negotiations. I would not for a moment challenge the right of the Opposition to seek to move the Adjournment under Standing Order No. 8—I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. It is very rarely that the privilege is obtained. I know we did not have much luck in that respect. I do not challenge the right hon. Gentleman's Parliamentary rights in that respect, but as he will recognise, it is awkward, when we are at the initiation of negotiations of this character on which much is to follow, that we should be involved, however inevitably, in a Parliamentary Debate the various speeches in which will be interpreted in their own way by this or that party to the discussions, and may not be without their complications in the ensuing events. But as the right hon. Gentleman's speech went on, I thought he emerged from his very noble and worthy intentions to be conciliatory, and became rather worked up to the stage where he was at Question Time this afternoon.<p></p> It is my business to try to give an objective statement of the facts, not to seek to be unduly provocative on this occasion—hon. Members opposite will he glad to know that that is my intention—and to put the facts as we see them—hon. Gentlemen opposite may agree with them or not—before the House. What I think the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition a little forgets is that 1946 in that part of the world is not 1936, and it is not 1929. It may be awkward. The world has a habit of moving on. We hope it is moving forward; sometimes it may be moving backward. As the film voice says, "Time marches on." We cannot help it. The right hon. Gentleman, I think, is a little liable to think that the situation with which we have to deal in these discussions in Egypt in the year 1946, is what it was in 1936 or 1929. I assure him that that is not so. It is a very different situation, as has been pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes), who delivered a most useful speech in the support of the Government. <span id="vol414_col1688" class="cross-reference" data-house-id="1" data-column-number="1688" data-volume-number="414">[<em>Interruption</em>.] No. My hon. Friend has done nothing else in this Parliament. What he did in the last one is another matter. <span id="898" class="column-number" data-column-number="898"></span> In this Parliament he has been most helpful. He is not unfamiliar with this country, as we all know. The hon. Member for the Combined English Universities (Mr. Kenneth Lindsay) came to us almost directly as a man on the spot. At any rate, he is only just off the spot. He gave us the opinions or the impressions—[<em>Interruption</em>]—I listened to the right hon. Gentleman; I think the noble Lord might extend as much courtesy to me. Hon. Members may agree or disagree with the hon. Member for the English Universities. That is their right. He is an intelligent observer and he has come almost straight back from Egypt. He gave the House information which, I am bound to say, confirms the opinion which had been given to His Majesty's Government.<p></p> As we all know, these negotiations are taking place 10 years after 1936. In answer to the hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg), may I say they are taking place in accordance with Article XVI of the Treaty of 1936—not 1937, as was said in error. The Treaty was dated 1936. As was contemplated, they could reopen the discussion in 10 years' time. That is the present period. I do not suppose any of us would have chosen this particular moment for the reopening of this discussion, but the Egyptian Government is exercising its rights of discussion under the Treaty and I do not think His Majesty's Government could in any way resist that right of discussion.<p></p> The Egyptian Government in the opening of these discussions sought three things. I want the House to follow this sequence of items that would be discussed. They were, (<em>a</em>) A decision in principle that there should be military evacuation, withdrawal, from Egypt; (<em>b</em>) Discussions on the ways and means and the timing of the withdrawal; and, (<em>c</em>) The question of the future of the alliance, including how military aid could be forthcoming, a question which will, of course, in itself raise all sorts of military considerations. So these are the three items which have to be discussed and about which negotiations are taking place—(<em>a</em>) withdrawal, (<em>b</em>) discussion of ways and means and the timing, and (<em>c</em>) the future circumstances and conditions of a military alliance. Today, stage (<em>a</em>) in these discussions has been reached, with the result that was announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister this afternoon. <span id="899" class="column-number" data-column-number="899"></span> Stages (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) are to follow forthwith. It has been asked why we have to deal with and complete stage (<em>a</em>) in the way announced by the Prime Minister today before entering on the discussions in relation to stages (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>). The answer is that we were advised to move along the lines announced by my right hon. Friend by all our people on the spot—by the Mission itself, led by the Secretary of State for Air and including the military, as well as the civil, elements of that Mission; second, the diplomatic people on the spot; and, thirdly, the military people on the spot. They all thought it right that we should proceed, in the first instance, as announced by the Prime Minister. In those circumstances, this was the conclusion that was impressed upon us and as to which we were advised, and it was the conclusion to which we came—that, without an acceptance of the principle of withdrawal, it was clear that we could get no effective or favourable progress in the negotiations.<p></p> The hon. and learned Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Party is perfectly right when he says that, faced with that issue, we had to settle it one way or the other, and that, whichever way we did settle it, we had to face up to the consequences of whatever decision we reached. We were advised, indeed, by all the people on the spot, and this is confirmed by the hon. Gentleman opposite that this was necessary in order to get effective and useful negotiations, because this principle of withdrawal from what they regard as ocupation of their soil by a foreign Power was strongly insisted upon, not only by the Egyptian Government and by the Egyptian Parliament, but also, as far as we can judge, by the Egyptian people. We did not manufacture that situation. There it is, and this is the year—1946—in which we have to face that situation. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington said that—I think I am right—he had never known an Egyptian statesman who had demanded the complete withdrawal of British troops from Egypt; withdrawal from Cairo to the Canal zone, yes, but not complete withdrawal. I think that is the right version of what the right hon. Gentleman said. I must say it is curious that he should have missed publication of a Note by the Egyptian Government, <span id="900" class="column-number" data-column-number="900"></span> which was published in "The Times" of 3rst January. This official Note of the Egyptian Government said: <blockquote><q>"The presence of foreign troops on our soil in peace time, even if sustained in distant areas, is still wounding to national dignity."</q></blockquote><p></p> They recorded their objections. Therefore, the right hon. Gentleman was not accurate in that respect at any rate. This note was received at the end of 1945, by His Majesty's Government and was as I say published in "The Times" of 3rst January, 1946. Supposing we had said to the Egyptian Government, "We will give no undertakings as to the withdrawal of British forces from Egyptian soil. We refuse. Let the negotiations go on, but we refuse to accept that principle."If we had said that, the negotiations would not have gone on, and then we would have had to face certain consequences. First, there would have been a sharp antagonism on the part of the Egyptian Government and Parliament, almost certain disturbance and riot and possibly even revolution. In those circumstances the Egyptian Government would almost certainly have said to us, first, that the Egyptian police and military either could not or might not be relied upon to deal with civil disturbance among the population of Egypt if it arose; secondly, if it did arise, that the British and their forces would, in all probability, be attacked, and, thirdly, that it would be for the British to defend themselves.<p></p> If we had got to that point it would have meant that we should have been in a position of active military operations in Egypt and, logically, getting on the road to the military occupation of the country. I do not think that we should have had the sympathy of our friends in the civilised world, or that it would have commended the assent of the people of our country. If I may say so with respect, it comes ill from the right hon. Gentleman who has denounced this Government for not demobilising quicker and who, indeed, said in this House on 22nd October: <blockquote><q>"There are no more enemies to conquer; no more fronts to hold. [HON. MEMBERS: 'Oh."] I mean, of course, in a military sphere. All our foreign foes have been beaten down into unconditional surrender. Now is the time to bring home the men who have conquered, and bring them back to their families and productive work."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 22nd Oct., 1945; Vol. 414, c. 1688, 1689.]</span></q></blockquote></p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">

<p class="">With respect, the right hon. Gentleman cannot denounce us for not demobilising in a peaceful world, and then urge us into policies which would create the reverse. Moreover, as I have said, we should lose the sympathetic support of our friends in the world. Therefore, with our advisers in Egypt and at home, we reluctantly agreed to the course announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. [HON. MEMBERS: "Reluctantly?"] We did not rush to <span id="902" class="column-number" data-column-number="902"></span> get out of Egypt, but we had to face facts. I was about to say that we agreed to the course announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, first, because, in the circumstances which I have indicated, it was right in principle to take that course and, secondly, because it was expedient with a view to getting the best agreement possible with our Egyptian Allies in the common interest. That is the defence, in conjunction with what my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said of His Majesty's Government, and I invite the full support of the House.<p></p> Question put, "That this House now adjourn."<p></p> The House divided: Ayes, 158; Noes, 327.</p>                    <div class="hidden-md hidden-lg" style="padding-left: 0px;">
