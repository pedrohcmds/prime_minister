1950-12-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1950-12-14;Prime Minister's Visit To Usa;151;I think there has been a general desire that with this debate I should give a fuller account of the talks which I had at Washington and supplement the fairly full report that was given in the communiqué. I should like at the outset to recall the circumstances in which I decided to pay a visit to the United States of America. It will be recalled that the House debated foreign affairs on 29th and 30th November, and that just at that time there were grave developments in Korea. I think there was in this country, and, perhaps, not only in this country, a good deal of anxiety as to where events were leading us, and the course of the debate indicated that the present time would be opportune for me to pay a visit to the President of the United States, which I had had in contemplation for some time.

One can always take examples from what happens. The President of the United States the other day let himself be cross-examined freely during a Press conference on this very topic. In my opinion, one ought not to say anything upon the subject one has not very carefully considered beforehand. I certainly do not intend to be cross-examined by the hon. Gentleman, because I have considered carefully what I should say. I am strongly of opinion that the Government should make a fuller statement upon this subject, and that this would be beneficial both to our own position and to our relationship with the United States. After all, this matter has become one of very real and vital consequence to us since the decision of the Government to afford the United States the bomber base in East Anglia, which makes it all the more necessary that the  position in which we stand should be clearly defined.

We wished the right hon. Gentleman well upon his Transatlantic mission, and we have recognised the advantages which it has secured, but I will say now that if he persists in his present attitude on steel nationalisation, he will fail in his duties  to the country as a whole. Although we approved of the visit of the Prime Minister to the United States, although we lent him full support on his mission, although the results have been helpful so far as they go, we cannot in these circumstances feel confidence in the loyalty of the Government to the people of this country. The Prime Minister is counting on our support, which will—[HON.

1947-6-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-6-03;India (Transfer Of Power);170;It is, of course, impossible for the House to weigh and measure the full meaning of the most important statement which has just been made to us by the Prime Minister. I am bound to say that it seemed very difficult to understand, but the White Paper which is in the Vote Office will have to be studied with attention and will probably carry the largest measure of proof to those who are best instructed. No doubt we shall have a Debate at a suitable moment on this question. I am not asking for any particular date to be fixed at the present moment. I am bound to say, however, that the two conditions foreseen at the time of the Cripps Mission, which was set up under my Administration—namely, first, agreement between the Indian parties and, secondly, a period of Dominion status in which India or any part of it may freely decide whether or not to remain within the association of the British Commonwealth of Nations—seem to be fulfilled.
1947-6-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-6-03;India (Transfer Of Power);26;May I respectfully say that this is a matter of considerable importance? Surely, the Opposition party should be permitted to make some passing and brief comments.
1947-6-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-6-03;India (Transfer Of Power);62;As I was saying, the two principles on which the Cripps Mission stood—namely, agreement and a period of Dominion status with perfect freedom to choose—appear to be fulfilled, as far as I can see from the copy of the White Paper which is now in the Vote Office and which, through the courtesy of the Prime Minister, I received an hour ago.
1947-6-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-6-03;India (Transfer Of Power);203;Even in Russia there are distinctions between the grades which different people occupy. If it should prove to be the case that these two conditions have been maintained in fact and in form, then I say that all parties in this House are equally pledged by the offer and the declaration that we have made, and on these points we can only be well assured by the course of events in the next few weeks and months. It is quite true that the agreement of the various parties in India has only been achieved on the basis of partition. I gather that is the foundation. Nevertheless, after a reasonable period of deliberation and responsibility, should all these parties decide to remain within the British Commonwealth of Nations, the theme of the unity of India will be preserved, and the many nations and States of India may find their unity within the mysterious circle of the British Crown, just as the self-governing Dominions have done for so many years after all other links with the Mother Country, save those of sentiment, have been dissolved. It may, therefore, be that through a form of partition, the unity of India may, none the less, be preserved.

With regard to the second point, I did say there would have to be a boundary commission with regard to Sylhet, and I would take it--I am not acquainted with that particular district intimately—that, if there is any district adjoining that might be brought into Bengal suitably, that would be a matter for consideration. With regard to the tribes on the North-East frontier, as the hon. and gallant Gentleman knows so well, they come into the Province of Assam; and that will fall to be dealt with by the Constituent Assembly of which Assam forms a part.

Nor do I think this last statement which has been made by the right hon.

The mutiny, or what is called a mutiny, although it seemed a very mild form of mutiny compared with some we have seen in our own time, occurred in May. All June passed. Am I not right in presuming that in June convening orders were given, or the question of bringing these men to trial, either individually or collectively, was discussed? Was not the Judge Advocate-General consulted at that time? What happened in June? What happened in July, when this matter was going on? What happened in August, when these men were still confined under the severe conditions of a tropical land? Why is it only now, when a great storm has been raised in the Press and Parliament, that the Judge Advocate-General is suddenly consulted, and the right hon. Gentleman has to defer to his legal opinion and say that the whole procedure from beginning to end is quashed for the ringleaders as well as the rank and file—all their trials are quashed? How is it that for five long months the Government, with the advice of the Judge Advocate-General always available at their disposal, have permitted this matter to drag itself out to the general suffering of individuals and the impairment of discipline in the Army?
1946-10-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-10-10;Mutiny Charges, Malaya (Convictions Quashed);179;Are we to understand then that the then Secretary of State for War was officially apprised of the fact that action was to be taken against 258 men on a charge of mutiny—a collective trial as it were—and he never had any idea of asking "Is this legal? What precedents are there for this?" Are we to understand that he never asked the Judge Advocate-General, "Is this all right? Is this a legal and proper way of doing it? and that no member of the Government or of the Army Council promoted inquiries of that kind? The right hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that I have had experience of these matters. I unhappily presided over the Army when there was a shoal of mutinies. No one ever attempted to bring large masses of the rank and file to a mass trial. There was the naval mutiny in the days of Ramsay MacDonald's Premiership, and no one thought of bringing great masses to trial. Why was this not settled by the Government and the Cabinet at the time?

I do not mean at this moment, but why should they not be made public? Surely it would be of great advantage to the future to know what are the principles on which we are proceeding. Since when has it been held to be disadvantageous to the cause of justice for the principles on which judicial authorities give their decisions to be made known? If that is not so, how are others to regulate their conduct? Was the question of the mass trial one of the causes of the irregularity? In any case, will not a full statement be made of the legal grounds which have led to the quashing of these sentences?
1946-10-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-10-10;Mutiny Charges, Malaya (Convictions Quashed);36;I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman.

1952-12-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-16;Nato (Commander-In-Chief, Mediterranean);163;When the right hon. Gentleman announced that the Supreme Command in the Atlantic should go to an American admiral, I thought it a pity, because I thought that we knew most about the reception end, as I have called it. I would have preferred at that time to have had the Supreme Command in the Atlantic for Britain, and would have welcomed the Americans in the Mediterranean, because it was very desirable that they should intervene in force and with a fleet there. However, the right hon. Gentleman had his way. When I went to Washington, it was already settled. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Yes. I had to deal with a matter which had been effectively decided, but arrangements were made then, which I described in the House in as much detail as was possible, which did secure the effective control of the reception end of the Atlantic, and that we have now. That was all as a result of modifications agreed to then.
1952-12-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-16;Nato (Commander-In-Chief, Mediterranean);45;I am aware of that.

1944-3-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-28;War Despatches (Publication);115;This particular publication is one of a series which gives accounts, which I believe are of great interest to the public, of the different campaigns. The passages referring to particular changes of command were not written in any controversial style and do not, in my opinion, in any way alter the answer I gave against publication of despatches in time of war. They do not reflect upon the officers concerned in any manner which would require any further official statement. Of course, if I were pressed to make a further statement, I should be ready to state the reasons why I made certain changes, but I should deprecate it, in the interests of all concerned.

As to this booklet, which was written by the War Office, I had not myself seen it until attention was drawn to it by this Question, but, as I say, it is one of a series of an  informative character. I do not consider that it reflects upon the officers concerned in any manner which would require a special departure from the practice we have adopted.

We will study it with great attention and endeavour to see what meaning, if any, can be extracted from it. May I ask him whether he would consider, on the first page of his statement, altering the word "merely" —" not merely a military alliance "—to "not only a military alliance," because his statement deals almost entirely with military matters. "Merely" seems, I will not say a disparaging, but an inadequate term to use. As to this new word with which he has dignified our language, but which perhaps was imposed upon him internationally, I can only say that we must have full opportunity to consider it and to consult the dictionary.

1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);142;Could the right hon. Gentleman let us know the character of the invitation or summons that was sent to Seretse Khama? Was there in it any intimation that he might be forbidden to return to the Protectorate for five years? I am glad to hear that, apparently, he is free to return. Is that so? Can he return at any moment? Otherwise, quite apart from the large issues which are raised in this matter, and which I would not attempt to discuss at this time, the question I would ask is whether this chief is being treated quite fairly as between man and man. That is a point which causes some anxiety. To put the point precisely, was he aware beforehand that this decision might be given against him and that he would be the subject of this special regulation and restriction?
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);24;Where would the exclusion order be enforced? Would it be  enforced at the frontiers of the Protectorate or after he had re-entered the Protectorate?

I am not trying to deal with the large questions at all. Will he consider whether it would not be better to allow this man to return to exactly the same position that he was in at the point when the correspondence took place, whatever are the Government's views, rights and authority in the matter?
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);99;May I return to the very simple point in which some of us on this side are interested, namely, the question of whether he was enticed over  here under false pretences or not, and whether he will be restored to his previous position? Where is Mrs. Khama at present, and where was she at the time when Seretse Khama took leave of her? Will the right hon. Gentleman not consider that Seretse has a right to go back to that very place and meet her at that very place before the Government take any further action in the matter?
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);6;It is a very disreputable transaction.

Gentleman told us just now that it was untrue to suggest that any of these questions raised by my hon.

1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;153;I consider that His Majesty's Government were right in not giving out a great deal of information about the flying bombs until we knew more about them and were able to measure their effect. The newspapers have in an admirable manner helped the Government in this, and I express my thanks to them. The time has come, however, when a fuller account is required and a wider field of discussion should be opened, and in my opinion such a discussion is no longer hampered by the general interest. I would at the same time enjoin upon hon. Members and the public outside to watch their step in anything they say, because a thing which might not strike one as being harmful at all might give some information to the enemy which would be of use to him and a detriment to us. Still, a very wide field of discussion will be open henceforth.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;275;Certainly. Children are already being sent at their parents' wish out of the danger areas, which are by no means exclusively confined to the Metropolis. There is, of course, the bomb highway over which the robots all pass before reaching that point of Southern England which I have ventured to particularise this morning. Children are being sent if their parents wish out of the danger areas and, in all cases, mothers with small children, or pregnant women, will be given full facilities by the State. And we do not propose to separate the mother from the child except by her wish, but a terrible thing happened last time. Mothers were separated from children of two or three years of age, and, after a period, when they had saved up money and got time to go down and see them, the children hardly knew them. I hope now with our growing strength, reserves and facilities for removal, we shall be able to say to a mother with three or four children, "If you wish to leave, it is perfectly possible. Arrangement will be made to take you into the country with your children. If you wish them to go by themselves and  you wish to stay here with your husband, or because of your jab, then arrangements can be made that way too." We do not consider that the scale of attack under which we lie at present justifies Governmental compulsion in' any case. In order to speed these arrangements, my Noble Friend the Minister of War Transport, Lord Leathers, has arranged that the railways should provide a larger service of trains from the London stations.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;251;A good many questions can be asked, but the House, I am sure, would wish to have a check-up on them beforehand, because a perfectly innocent and proper question might have some connection which would tell the enemy more than we need tell him. After all, the Germans keep large Intelligence services, always prying about and trying to find out everything they can, and really we ought to leave them something to do. I can see lots of questions that could well be discussed here, and if there were some particular kind of question we wanted to talk over among ourselves such procedure is always available to the House. I am not going to attempt to parade to the House the many difficult questions that have been settled. I have mentioned a good many of them. I could give a complete list, and if I have left  anything out, that is a matter that can be reserved for a future day. We can with confidence leave our civil organisation to do their work under the watchful supervision of the House of Commons. We have had many periods in the war in which the Government have relied on the House of Commons to keep them in close touch with the people and the population affected and from whom we have welcomed helpful suggestions. I think that we can have great confidence in our civil organisation, for they have immense experience and have handled machinery which has stood far greater strains than this.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;191;I would venture to make a suggestion on the spur of the moment. That is, that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Home Security  should depute someone to whom Members could refer, and, if they did not get satisfaction in that way, they could take such other measures as are open. I feel that there will be questions, small questions, but in some cases very painful questions, and I am anxious that the House shall keep in close touch with the Government in this affair, which we are all in together, as in so many others. But it seems to me that it would be a good thing if my right hon. Friend deputed someone 'who was a member of his Committee who could see Members who were anxious about this matter. I did something like this myself 25 years ago during demobilisation after the last war, and it gave great satisfaction. At that time questions amounted to several hundreds a day. If there is any better way of doing it, I will talk it over with my right hon. Friend, and he will make some statement to the House.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;89;It is not for me to answer that question. It belongs to the Leader of the House. On the general question of policy, it is much better that there should be no secret Debate, which would give a sort of idea that I have not been frank with the House. I have been brutally frank. Sometime next week, if my right hon. Friend can find the time for it, it might be very useful to hear both matters which require remedy and ideas which may be put into practice.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;84;I am afraid that I overlooked that in my speech. We always regarded these deep shelters as a reserve, and it has now been decided to make use of them. The Home Secretary is much to be congratulated in having these up his sleeve, and we must make use of them in the manner which is most effective to our general plans, not merely as places where particular individuals can camp out indefinitely, but as part of the general movement and life of London.

1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;23;On the question of deep shelters, I ought to have said that it will take a few days to make the necessary arrangements.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;103;That might easily do something which the hon. Gentleman would be the last to wish. Something might be said which might help the enemy. Every word is read and eagerly scanned in order to try to make up a case. A Debate in public very often consists of criticism, quite naturally, because those who are satisfied remain silent. I am not sure that we need unduly stress the troubles we have to face and mean to conquer, by a public Debate during which at any moment it might be necessary for the Minister to say that we ought to go into Secret Session.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;74;I have said deliberately that that is a subject which raises grave considerations and upon which I do not intend to embark. That, I am sure, is the best way in which to leave it. Might I appeal to the House not to pursue unduly these interrogatories to-day?

1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;7;No, Sir, it would not be advisable.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;18;That is a matter which might well be considered. I have said that extra trains will be provided.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;37;That would be a very proper question to put to my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of Health. Might I suggest that it would be a pity for us to make too much of this?

1940-11-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-11-12;Mr Neville Chamberlain;44;Since we last met, the House has suffered a very grievous loss in the death of one of its most distinguished Members and of a statesman and public servant who, during the best part of three memorable years, was first Minister of the Crown.
1940-11-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).txt;1940-11-12;Mr Neville Chamberlain;299;I desire to add a few words on behalf of the Labour party to the eloquent and moving tribute which the Prime Minister has paid to one who was so lately our colleague in the Government, and to one who only six months ago was himself the Prime Minister. It is an old and gracious tradition of this House, when death comes to one who has taken a leading place in Parliament, that controversy should be stilled while leaders of all parties speak in recognition of the loss which has been sustained in common by all Members. At the present time, when war has brought together in support of one Government all the great parties of the State, it might seem, perhaps, unnecessary that anyone should speak from this Bench except the Prime Minister, who can speak for us all. Yet there is, I think, good reason to continue our ancient usages. It is characteristic of the way of life which we are fighting to preserve not to allow political differences to prevent mutual respect and friendship. It is a mark of our democracy to attain national unity, not by uniformity, but by diversity. For all but a few months of his political career, Neville Chamberlain stood for policies in home and foreign affairs to which we of the Labour Party were opposed, and often very bitterly opposed. But this is not the time or the occasion to pass any judgment on those controversies. We are too close to them to gain a true perspective. But opposed as we were to his policy, we never doubted that Mr. Chamberlain was honestly and sincerely following the course which he believed to be right in the interests of his country. We never doubted his deep devotion to the cause of peace.

It was a matter which required careful consideration. One has to have a just sense of proportion in all these matters and, of course, one cannot judge the proportion of the individual except in relation to the background of world affairs, all of which has to be considered in its entirety. The  first 50 years of the 20th century have been among the most terrible that the human race has ever lived through, with two frightful world wars and immense disturbance and destruction of human life. On the other hand, they have contained the greatest promise for the future in the advance of science, knowledge and the broadening assembly of peoples in every way.

We are therefore entirely in favour of these gifts being made from the mother of Parliaments to the daughter States as they were, sister States as they are—I am not quite sure how these family arrangements are conceived of on the other side of the globe —who carry forward so much of our traditions and life and on whom we rely not only to strengthen us in the years to come but to carry our message on to future ages that we shall not perhaps see, in proportionately as powerful a position as we occupy at the present time.

1944-3-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-3-22;Post-War Food Rationing;118;The full text of the speech of my right hon. and gallant Friend the Minister of Food shows clearly that he is no advocate of rationing for rationing's sake and in particular that he is a firm believer in the fact that we are down, in this country, to the minimum ration diet which will enable it to realise its full war effort in the field and in the factory. It is obvious that rationing will have to continue for some time after the end of the war. I do not, therefore, consider that my right hon. and gallant Friend's speech raised any new issue.

1941-4-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-4-30;Withdrawal Of Empire Forces;304;As I am most anxious to give the House, the nation and the Empire information at the earliest possible moment, and also in view of the extravagant claims made by the enemy, I think it right now to give the figures, so far as they are known, of the evacuation of the Empire Forces from Greece. Up to the time when evacuation was seen to be inevitable, we had landed about 60,000 men in Greece, including one New Zealand and one Australian division. Of these at least 45,000 have been evacuated, and considering that our Air Force was, through the superiority of the enemy, forced to leave the air-fields from which it could alone effectively cover the retreat of our troops, and that only a  small portion of it could cover the points of embarkation, this must be considered remarkable. The conduct of the troops and especially the rearguards in fighting their way to the sea merits the highest praise. This is the first instance where air bombing, prolonged day after day, has failed to break the discipline and order of the marching columns who, besides being thus assailed from the air, were pursued by no less than three German armoured divisions as well as by the whole strength of the German mechanised forces which could be brought to bear. In the actual fighting, principally on Mount Olympus,. around Grevena and at Thermopylae, about 3,000 casualties, killed and wounded, are reported to have been suffered by our troops. This was a very small part of the losses inflicted on the Germans, who on several occasions, sometimes for two days at a time, were brought to a standstill by forces one-fifth of their number. Nor, of course, does it take any account of German losses incurred in their assaults on the Greek and Yugoslav Armies.
1941-4-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-4-30;Withdrawal Of Empire Forces;33;I believe that is so; indeed I think I am well within the figure, but, as I say, I have given the information in the terms in which it was given to me.

Gentlemen opposite must not be drawn into exaggerated hopes. They are no longer, as we stood in the days of the Lloyd George Budget, at the first frontier of a large and fertile territory. The entire area has been swept through, harvested and gleaned, and gleaned again and again, and we stand on the far side of what is now a thoroughly scrubbed field. It is an astonishing fact—which my right hon. Friend the late Chancellor has mentioned to me—that, if you took all the incomes in this country above £2,000, every penny of it, if you took the whole of that into  the Exchequer, keeping the existing rates of Income Tax and Surtax going, the profit to the Exchequer would be £60,000,000, and that figure of £60,000,000 has to be considered in relation—that is a remarkable statement—to a Budget which has at present to be balanced in March next in the neighbourhood of £5,400,000,000. It has to be balanced at that rate. It must also be judged in relation to schemes of social betterment and reform which run into not £60,000,000 or £600,000,000, but, in many cases, into thousands of millions of expenditure in the long run. Therefore, the great glee which is manifested is rather of a shallow nature and those who feel it running through their veins should prepare themselves for the fact that that is probably the only satisfaction which they will get out of the business.

It would be a very great omission on my part if I did not take this opportunity to return most humble, dutiful and grateful thanks for the announcement which has been made that compulsory insurance premiums against further damage by enemy bombs, are not going to be collected. It gives one confidence to feel that one lives in a land where there is so much broadminded tolerance shown by the executive Government. But I thought it was rather hot when my right hon. Friend came along  for the last instalment after the danger against which we insured had, by the success of our arms, been swept away. It certainly does fall to the right hon.

Friend the Minister of State on 7th February. No decision has yet been taken on the composition of the British Delegation to the Council of Europe. The Permanent Commission of the Brussels Treaty have not yet completed their examination of detailed plans. When they have done so a Governmental Conference will have to be convened at which it is hoped that other European countries besides the Brussels Treaty Powers will assist in the framing of a constitution for the Council of Europe. Recommendations of this Conference will be referred back to Governments, and His Majesty's Government will only then be in a position to report to the House. The right hon.

In view of the present military position that objection no longer holds. I read in the newspapers that there is an impression in some quarters in the United States that our stocks in Great Britain amount to 700,000,000 tons. Actually they are now rather less than 6,000,000 tons. They are in process of being reduced, by aid to the liberated countries, to about 4,750,000 tons by the end of June. This latter figure is no more than is necessary to maintain a regular flow of distribution under present conditions. I thought it was worth while mentioning these facts about our stocks of food, which have been built up by foresight and self-denial over five years of strict rationing and frequent bombardment.

1943-4-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-06;Post-War Aircraft Manufacture;113;His Majesty's Government have taken no decision about the nationalisation after the war of the manufacture of aircraft, whether for civilian or military purposes. I cannot conceive that the Government would embark upon such a policy with all its implications without consulting not only the House but the country. As to the last part of the Question, there is no intention to use the war-time powers to prejudice unjustly any existing firm or their shareholders. Decisions as to the future policy of the State in time of peace must be taken on general grounds and by regular constitutional means and not as a result of the application of war-time measures in particular instances.

Of course, if the Chairman does not give way, the hon.

However, various other Departments are also closely involved. All this proceeds under my responsibility as Minister of Defence. In February, 1941, I formed the Battle of the Atlantic Committee and instituted meetings under my personal direction, in order to focus and emphasise the need for supreme exertions and to make sure that there was proper concert between all authorities. Meetings were held at first weekly, and later at longer intervals. Eighteen were held in 1941 and 1942. As the House knows, a very great alleviation of our losses occurred up till December, 1941, and I was satisfied during 1942 that the organisation was running with complete smoothness and efficiency.

1940-2-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-27;Navy Estimates, 1940;261;I entirely sympathise with that feeling, but I can assure the hon. Member that I rarely like to be at any considerable distance from a piece of wood. But there is a difference in making predictions and in stating facts about the past, and facts which are known at the moment. So far as the future is concerned, I always speak with the greatest caution, but when you are making a statement of what the facts are at this moment, after six months of the war, on this occasion to the House, I think it is right to say what the state of affairs really is, because it is said that even Heaven itself cannot control the past. Therefore, I say that apart from the "Royal Oak" and the "Courageous," no other large ships have been damaged or sunk since the outbreak of war or during these very difficult winter months. I say difficult months, because not only  have our ships had constantly to keep the sea in sufficient strength amid the storms of a tempestuous winter, amid icy blizzards and high-running seas, but since the "Royal Oak" was sunk we have not had the use of Scapa Flow, which is, of course, our best strategic base, and which would save our ships from a great deal of unnecessary steaming through dangerous waters. "Under the adverse circumstances," if I may quote a hero's phrase, our ships, great and small, have been at sea more continually than was ever done or dreamed of in any previous war since the introduction of steam.

I am very much obliged to the hon.

The measure is the number of men available in the various yards, private and public, and the need for increasing that number of men is very great indeed. Warship building must have priority up to a certain point, but we have equally to replace our merchant tonnage. It does seem to me that at the present time the supply of labour is not adequate to the effort we should like to make in both these fields.

Gentleman has not done that at all, and I shall put to the House the words he has inserted which show how far from accuracy that muttered interjection lies. Little as we like the 1945 Act, or subscribe to its principles in time of peace, I doubt if it would have encountered any serious opposition if the Bill had merely been for the removal of doubt as to whether that Act was still in force now.
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;297;Hon. Gentlemen opposite cheer that, but applied in its full force that would be the complete abrogation of Parliament and of all our dearly-bought and long-cherished liberties and rights. It is not only Governments that have rights—ordinary British people have them too. No reason has been given us by the Lord President, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, to justify the casting away, by us, undefended, of such rights as are still free from the operation of the 1945 Act. Who is to be the judge, I should like to know, of whether the conditions of Clause 1 (1, c), those sweeping words which excite the enthusiasm of hon. Members opposite, are in fact fulfilled by any legislation demanded by the Government? It is only Ministers who are to be the judge. The courts have ruled that the Minister who takes executive action has only to declare that he considers that action necessary under the Act, and that is the end of the matter. That is, at any rate, the practice which is growing up. There is no protection at all to be looked for in that quarter. Therefore, the only guarantee we would have that Clause 1 (1, c), would not be abused is in the character of Ministers and the confidence we place in them. Thus we are asked to give a blank cheque for totalitarian government, for that is what this is, at the absolute discretion of Ministers who, proceeding by Orders in Council when Parliament is not sitting, and may not be sitting for months, would be absolute masters. Is this really necessary to the life and recovery of the country? I should have thought that it would have spread so much uneasiness and alarm as to discourage and paralyse effort.

1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;15;So I did. I have been so much interrupted. But I have got another one: 
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;10;The right hon and learned Gentleman went on to say: 
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;127;Hon. Members opposite seem to be very hilarious, but there is an air of apprehension behind their laughter, because they know that they will have to justify on every platform in the country not only the physical miseries which they have inflicted upon this country, but the gross invasions of our fundamental liberties. I ask, are these powers in Subsection (1, c), in their vague, all-embracing terms, the kind of powers which we would entrust to a man who holds these views about this House, and about society and the State in relation to ordinary men and women? Naturally, one shrinks from giving support to such immense powers when we have heard beforehand how one of the most able of all the Ministers intends to use them.
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;261;Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will be successful in catching your eye, Mr. Speaker. He is not successful in catching mine. I am still mystified about the intentions and motives of the Government. The Prime Minister's speech on Wednesday is universally judged to be inadequate to the crisis and vague in its character. Are the Government trying to make up for lack of deeds by boastful words? That is a point which has occurred to me. It is the most innocent explanation of this Bill that I can find. Why should they come forward with all these demands for totalitarian powers when nothing that was said by the Prime Minister or by any of the Ministers who spoke yesterday in the Debate furnishes any substantial reason for their need? Is it because—and we must ask ourselves this—they wish to get Parliament separated and away on the holidays and then use these powers with irrevocable effect? Or is it, having no  effective plan or design, they wish to cover up their vacuity by the assumption of sweeping powers? Some light must be cast on this as the Debate proceeds. If the Government are sincerely concerned with the enduring validity of the 1945 legislation, and wish only to be reassured on that point, it is quite easy for them to accept the series of Amendments which we shall place on the Order Paper to that effect. If what they tell us is their purpose is true, it is quite easy for them greatly to diminish any criticism or opposition to this Measure.

We have urged the great inconvenience to which the public was subjected, and I should like to ask how it  was that these arrangements, which I must say seem to have been very carefully considered, could not have been thought out before striking the blow which caused immense disturbance and heavy internal loss to this country. Why should not all the thought, or a good part of the thought, contained in this statement have been expended in the Government Departments concerned, and the nation have had the benefit of a well-considered, carefully-considered scheme instead of the abrupt and crude cut?

Experience before, during and since the last war has shown conclusively that the main Civil Defence work is so closely linked with the maintenance of law and order and the work of local authorities that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland must be the focal points for preparations and for operational control in the event of war. There has, of course, to be close liaison between the fighting Services and  those engaged in Civil Defence, but this can be effectively secured, in our opinion, by consultations between Ministers and the services concerned.

Of course, undoubtedly, what is needed to make a very keen voluntary effort in Civil Defence is a sense of alarm, of danger. Without that it is difficult, and as the feeling that, perhaps, things are a little better and the outlook a little clearer grows in the land, it has that disadvantage that people do not feel the same need to be prepared for immediate war. Well, I think we shall have to put up with that.

Gentleman whether he is aware that there is general agreement on this side  of the House with what he calls the traditional view that the constitutional and civil authorities should control the actions of military commanders? May I also associate us on this side with what he has said about the brilliant services which General MacArthur has rendered throughout the Great War and since in the direction of affairs in Japan, and say that we do not feel that these troubles which have occurred recently in any way diminish the great quality of the services which he has rendered?
1943-7-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-14;Electoral Reform;118;The first point raised in this Question has been carefully considered, and it has been decided not to reduce the age qualification below 21 for the next General Election in respect of Service or ex-Service men and women, since any such step would operate harshly on those other young persons who, by virtue of their essential war work, have been unable to join the Forces. Since the other points raised will be open for discussion during the opportunity to be afforded to Parliament to discuss questions of electoral reform in good time before the next General Election, I do not consider it necessary for these matters to be investigated at this time by a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry.

What the right hon. Gentleman has not explained, and a point on which we should like an explanation, is why two Cabinet Ministers, who ought to be fully informed about operations, have themselves told us that when a major operation—something quite exceptional—came about, they never knew a word about it.

1952-7-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-01;Korean Campaign;98;One can easily go too far along such a road. When people say that they would rather commit suicide or would resist forcibly being sent back to the Communist zone, due consideration must be given to their wishes. Terrible things happened after the end of the Second World War about the repatriation of Russian prisoners. But, after all, we had been the ally of Russia, and many of these Russian prisoners had fought against their own country when it was in dire struggle. Moreover, the shape of the world was not defined as we can see it now.

We could easily replace their division with one of ours in Europe." There are many Americans who think that China is more important than Europe. It certainly would be a great misfortune if that line of thought were to prevail. Indeed, it might easily lead to the ruin of the whole European structure of defence which is being built up with so much effort and sacrifice and would expose us all to mortal danger not only of war but of destruction.

1938-3-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-3-15;Lieut-Colonel Muirhead's Statement;204;I do not propose to deal with the various criticisms which have been made by the hon. Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague), but the hon. Member concluded his speech by repeating the request for an independent inquiry into the work of the military side of the Royal Air Force, and it is for the purpose of dealing with that point, and that alone, that I have risen. The hon. Member based his request on what he represented to be virtually the demand of the Cadman Committee. I must say that I find nothing in the report of the Cadman Committee which justifies any statement such as that. One casual observation in a single paragraph out of the 124 paragraphs in the report was taken by the hon. Member, and he put on it a weight which was evidently far greater than it was in itself intended to bear. If, indeed, it had been in the mind of the Committee that an inquiry of this kind, or of the kind described by the hon. Member, were necessary in the public interest, they would certainly not have dismissed it in that brief sentence, but would have supported that demand by an adequate buttressing of evidence.

1938-3-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-15;Lieut-Colonel Muirhead's Statement;163;The hon. Member says we may have to, but at any rate, we are not going to do so until we are convinced that nothing else will serve our turn. While, as I said, at any time I should find it very difficult to accede to this request, which in fact amounts to instituting a court-martial upon the Air Ministry, I put it to hon. Members that they could not find a more inopportune moment than the present to institute an investigation which must distract the attention and occupy the minds of those who are engaged, not only in administration, but also in the production of our programmes. This is not the time to harry them to answer questions which do not sound to me as though they were based on any very competent authority. Let us all put our efforts together, get on with the job, and supply this country with the Air Force which it requires in the shortest possible time.

The passage which he has quoted deals with civil aviation and civil aviation alone, and the censure of which he speaks, of neglect of responsibility, is in relation to civil aviation. That is specifically mentioned.
1938-3-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-15;Lieut-Colonel Muirhead's Statement;128;I know. That is the sentence which the hon.

Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague) has quoted is paragraph 26. I am speaking of paragraph 23. I say that the censure upon the Secretary of State had reference to civil aviation and that the answer to that censure is that it is true that this matter was neglected, but the reason is clear and obvious to everybody, namely, that the Secretary of State was obliged to give his whole attention to the question of military aviation until that, at any rate, had been put on its feet.

1938-10-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-10-05;Policy Of His Majesty's Government;290;If I do not begin this afternoon by paying the usual, and indeed almost invariable, tributes to the Prime Minister for his handling of this crisis, it is certainly not from any lack of personal regard. We have always, over a great many years, had very pleasant relations, and I have deeply understood from per-  sonal experiences of my own in a similar crisis the stress and strain he has had to bear; but I am sure it is much better to say exactly what we think about public affairs, and this is certainly not the time when it is worth anyone's while to court political popularity. We had a shining example of firmness of character from the late First Lord of the Admiralty two days ago. He showed that firmness of character which is utterly unmoved by currents of opinion, however swift and violent they may be. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hull (Mr. Law), to whose compulsive speech the House listened on Monday—which I had not the good fortune to hear, but which I read, and which I am assured by all who heard it revived the memory of his famous father, so cherished in this House, and made us feel that his gifts did not die with him—was quite right in reminding us that the Prime Minister has himself throughout his conduct of these matters shown a robust indifference to cheers or boos and to the alternations of criticism and applause. If that be so, such qualities and elevation of mind should make it possible for the most severe expressions of honest opinion to be interchanged in this House without rupturing personal relations, and for all points of view to receive the fullest possible expression.

The utmost my right hon.

MEMBERS: "Is peace."] I thought I might be allowed to make that point in its due place, and I propose to deal with it. The utmost he has been able to gain for Czechoslovakia and in the matters which were in dispute has been that the German dictator, instead of snatching his victuals from the table, has been content to have them served to him course by course.
1938-10-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-10-05;Policy Of His Majesty's Government;173;She must very recently have been receiving her finishing course in manners. What will be the position, I want to know, of France and England this year and the year afterwards? What will be the position of that Western front of which we are in full authority the guarantors? The German army at the present time is more numerous than that of France, though not nearly so matured or perfected. Next year it will grow much larger, and its maturity will be more complete. Relieved from all anxiety in the East, and having secured resources which will greatly diminish, if not entirely remove, the deterrent of a naval blockade, the rulers of Nazi Germany will have a free choice open to them in what direction they will turn their eyes. If the Nazi dictator should choose to look westward, as he may, bitterly will France and England regret the loss of that fine army of ancient Bohemia which was estimated last week to require not fewer than 30 German divisions for its destruction.

Friend the figures which he desires. Now I think I have concluded what I wished to say. I wish to commend this Bill to the House as opening a new chapter in the relations between Eire and ourselves. The members of my family have more than once in the past made an effort to improve those relations, and if I feel some confidence that the prospects of a settlement this time are more hopeful than they were before, it is because the conditions which accompanied our negotiations were themselves far more favourable than we have ever had the good fortune to meet on previous occasions. These discussions have been carried through in a spirit of accommodation and good will. I would like to pay my tribute to Mr. de Valera and his colleagues for the way in which they played their part in these discussions. We could not always agree with them, but we always felt that we had' before us men of sincerity who were genuinely anxious to meet us and to come to terms with us if they could.  In spite of all the controversies of the past and all the heat that has been generated, this country and Eire cannot do without one another. Our natural interests and our geographical position inevitably tend to bring us together, and what has kept us apart has been, not a divergence of interests, but something which ought to be far less important, and that is a difference of opinion. Somebody sent me the other day a passage from John Selden's "Table Talk," written some 300 years ago, which perhaps the House will allow me to read, because, although it is quaintly expressed, it seems to have a bearing upon this subject. He writes: 
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;28;I will give a categorical denial now. I notice that Mr. de Valera also denied it in his speech to the Dail to which I have already referred.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;31;I do not deny that. I simply say that there is nothing of the sort to which my hon. Friend has referred. Mr. de Valera said there was no secret understanding.

1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;241;I could not reconcile it with my duty to the House, as a signatory to the Treaty, the broken Treaty, if I kept silent upon this Bill. However thankless the task may be, I feel bound to record the view which I have formed as the result of long and intimate contacts with Irish affairs. When I read this Agreement in the newspapers a week ago I was filled with surprise. On the face of it, it seemed to have given everything away and received nothing in return, except the payment of £10,000,000. Then I supposed there was another side to the Agreement, and that we were to be granted some facilities and rights in Southern Ireland in time of war. That, I notice, was the view taken by a part of the Press, but soon Mr. de Valera in the Dail made it clear that he was under no obligations of any kind and, as the Prime Minister confirmed this afternoon, there were no reservations on either side attached to this Agreement. On the contrary, Mr. de Valera has not even abandoned his claim for the incorporation of Ulster in the independent Republic that he has established. Indeed he said—I am not quoting his actual words—in his speech in the Dail that the ending of Partition will remain the main purpose of his life, and he believed that it would ultimately be found to be brought nearer by this Agreement.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;98;His Majesty's Government, supported by the Conservative party and the Opposition party have now accepted Mr. de Valera's claim practically without challenge, except for the fact that they are not prepared to put pressure upon Ulster to make her leave the United Kingdom. No doubt they would defend Ulster with all their strength if she were violently attacked. All the rest of the contentions of Mr. de Valera are by this Agreement, it seems to me—I hope I may be corrected on the legal view—tacitly or directly accepted. I think that is a fair statement of the position.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;252;Naturally, he did. I am sure he would. I admire very much the immediate manner in which he welcomed the great concessions which have been made to his country; but, as I say, I only wish that if they were to be made, they had been made to those who kept faith with us. None the less, the fact remains that in Irish history Mr. Cosgrave, his party and his friends will always be considered to have taken a poorer view of Ireland's chances than Mr. de Valera, and Mr. de Valera to have been the one who gained them the great advantages they got. That is a hard burden to impose in history upon men who faithfully adhere to solemnly-contracted treaties. Mr. de Valera has given no undertaking, except to fight against partition as the  main object of his life. But behind and beneath him there are other forces in Ireland. The dark forces in Ireland renew themselves from year to year. When some are conciliated, other present themselves. They are very powerful in Ireland now. No one has ever been brought to justice in Ireland since the Treaty for murdering an Englishman. There is a whole organisation of secret men bound together on the old principle that England's danger is Ireland's opportunity. Even Mr. de Valera, while gaining these astonishing triumphs over what these persons regard as their hereditary foe, is only with difficulty holding these forces in check and in suspense. Let him proclaim a friendly policy towards England—
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;337;—and you will find that they will immediately grow in force and become the party in the ascendant. Let him ask these people to expose Ireland to the great tribulations of war for the sake of England, and see what they will do. It seems to me that you cannot exclude this possibility of neutrality as being one which may well come within the immediate sphere of our experience. Therefore, I say that the ports may be denied to us in the hour of need and we may be hampered in the gravest manner in protecting the British population from privation, and even starvation. Who would wish to put his head in such a noose? Is there any other country in the modern world where such a step would even have been contemplated? Let me say this—and I hope it will not give offence—can anyone remember any other House of Commons where such proposals would have gone through in this easy manner? No doubt hon. Members will speak about the Dominions. No doubt I shall be told about South Africa, Canada and Australia. The case of Ireland is not comparable with the Dominions. Southern Ireland is not a Dominion; it has never accepted that position. It is a State based upon a Treaty, which Treaty has been completely demolished. Southern Ireland, therefore, becomes a State which is an undefined and unclassified anomaly. No one knows what its juridical and international rights and status are. The Dominions are far away. We could guarantee their immunity from attack  with our Fleet. The Dominions are loyal. Great as would be their loss, still I cannot feel that it would necessarily be fatal to us if, during the course of a war, there was a declaration of neutrality by one or other of the Dominions. But here the danger is at our very door. Without the use of these Treaty ports, even if their use were also withheld from an enemy, we should find the greatest difficulty in conducting our supply.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;30;We shall be fighting, if we ever should have that great calamity  thrust upon us, upon the basis and within the ambit of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;293;I never said anything against the Covenant of the League of Nations. I have no doubt hon. Members opposite would like very much to make that an issue between the two parties, but I hope and trust they will not succeed in that respect. When we are proceeding, as we should be in such unhappy circumstances, upon the basis of law and equity, how could we justify ourselves if we began by violating the neutrality of what the world will regard, and what we are teaching the world to regard, as the Independent Irish Republic? At the moment when the good will of the United States in matters of blockade and supply might be of the highest possible consequence, you might be forced to take violent action against all law and accepted usage, or alternatively you might be forced to sacrifice Ulster, or, in the third place, do without the use of these almost vitally important strategic ports. What is it all being done for? What are the new facts which have led to this sudden departure? To me, it is incomprehensible. To the world, to all the hungry aggressive nations, it will be taken as another sign that Britain has only to be pressed and worried long enough, and hard enough, for her to give way. If that is so, by that very fact you will bring the possibility of war nearer and you will lessen your resources for dealing with that danger. You are inviting demands from every quarter. You are casting away real and important means of security and survival for vain shadows and for ease. I have felt it my bounden duty to place these warnings and counsels, which I offer in all sincerity, before the House this afternoon.

1945-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-13;War Factories, Merseyside (Demonstration);129;I certainly have not had it. I am not in any way prepared to deal in detail with the very difficult, delicate and also immense questions connected with the function of women in the immediate post-war world. I imagine that many will seek release to retire to their homes. The arrival of the demobilised Army men will make great changes. I remember being much worried about this when I was Minister of Munitions at the end of the last war, when I had, I think, over 1,250,000 women under the direct control of that office. It all worked out quite all right for the actual moment; when men came back, the women, in many cases, gave up their jobs. My misfortunes did not begin until a year after that.

He thinks he can always get in by saying that it is a point of Order. I would like to answer my hon. Friend the Member for the Toxteth Division of Liverpool—[Hon. Members: "No, Scotland Division"]—well, I was not far away; I should have said the Scotland Division of Liverpool (Mr. Logan) by saying how very sorry I am that the accident occurred. I take no responsibility at this stage for the accident, but the fact that it has occurred is patent. How it can be remedied is also patent. If my hon. Friend will put down this Question to-morrow, as a Private Notice Question, and if the Chair allows it, I will take steps now to receive from him particulars of the Question which he wishes to ask. He has only to repeat it, and I shall be, as ever, at his service.

I am not prepared to commit myself on what particular subject I may or may not discuss with my fellow Commonwealth Prime Ministers during their visit. It is, however, well recognised that at Commonwealth meetings we do not intervene in matters which are primarily the concern of one individual country. Nevertheless, it is not possible to argue that South-West Africa is simply a matter of domestic concern to the Union Government. This Government and their predecessors have accepted an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice formally recognising that the United Nations have a direct and legitimate concern in the destiny of this former mandated territory. I do not think I want to say anything more upon the subject, and I do not commit myself at all in any way to any discussions which may or may not be raised.

1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;212;This long Debate has now reached its final stage. What a remarkable example it has been of the unbridled freedom of our Parliamentary institutions in time of war. Everything that could be thought of or raked up has been used to weaken confidence in the Government, has been used to prove that the Ministers are incompetent and to weaken their confidence in themselves, to make the Army distrust the backing it is getting from the civil power, to make the workmen lose condence in the weapons they are striving so hard to make, to represent the Government as a set of nonentities over whom the Prime Minister towers, and then to undermine him in his own heart and, if possible, before the eyes of the nation. All this poured out by cables and radio to all parts of the world, to the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our foes. I am in favour of this freedom, which no other country would use, or dare to use, in times of mortal peril such as those through which we are passing. But the story must not end there, and I make now my appeal to the House of Commons to make sure that it does not end there.
1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;81;I was only citing the facts as they are known to me; I have not been concerned to make a detailed attack upon the right hon. Gentleman's administration of the War Office. I am explaining that we had, at the time after Dunkirk, to concentrate upon numbers. We had to make thousands of armoured vehicles with which our troops could beat the enemy off the beaches when they landed and fight them in the lanes and fields of Kent or Norfolk.
1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;185;At the present moment I have not got there. At the present moment I am only dealing with the Matildas, Cruisers and Valentines, which I may say belong to the Belisha group. Nevertheless, I was about to say that in spite of the fact that there was this undoubted delay through no preliminary work having been carried as far as it should have been, it would be wrong in my opinion to write off as useless the Matilda, the Cruiser and the Valentine  tanks. They have rendered great services, and they are to-day of real value. In Russia the Valentine is highly rated. Has the House any idea of the number of tanks we have sent to Russia? As I said, we have sent 4,500 altogether to the Nile Valley. We have sent over 2,000 tanks to Russia, and the Russians are using them against the German armour, with vigour and effect. Therefore, I am not prepared to say that it is right to dismiss these weapons—although their appearance was retarded by the circumstances which I have mentioned—as not effective and powerful weapons of war.
1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;225;In what way does that affect the argument I am holding, namely, that if we had made dive bombers instead of 8-gun fighter aircraft, we might not have had the 8-gun fighter aircraft to shoot down the JU.87's when they came over? I remember well, 40 years ago, rising to interrupt the late Mr. Balfour, and, after I had said what I had to say, he rebuked me by saying, "I thought my hon. Friend rose to correct me on some point of fact, but it appears that he only wishes to continue the argument." Now there is no doubt whatever that the Army desire to have dive bombers, and, nearly two years ago orders were placed for them. They have not come to hand in any number yet. That is a detailed story which I certainly do not wish to press, if it should be thought in any way that we were throwing any blame off our shoulders onto those of the United States. On the point of priority, the case is clear, when  you have, as you had then in the United States, an immense market, an immense productive sphere and no priority questions had arisen. The rate at which the product was evolved was not influenced by the priority position. It was influenced by various incidents—changes of design and so forth—which occurred.

This may imply medical treatment, the finding of suitable work or other help. The discharged man will at his own request be put in touch with a suitable civilian social agency. Work of this type has already been done informally, but it is hoped in future to make it much more widely available. The Ministry of Pensions is fully informed of the facts relating to all discharges and arranges continuance of hospital treatment where necessary. It is neither desirable nor legally correct to notify medical facts about individuals who are discharged to civil authorities in any automatic way.

The resistance of the batteries has been greatly weakened by the bombing of the Air Force, and the superior bombardment-of our ships quickly reduced their fire to dimensions which did not affect the problem. The landing of the troops on a broad front, both British and American—Allied troops, I will not give lists of all the different nationalities they represent or the States they represent—but the landings along the whole front have been effective, and our troops have penetrated, in some cases, several miles inland.

1952-11-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-11-20;Atom And Hydrogen Bombs (Information);64;I have heard all sort of estimates of the increased power of the hydrogen bomb over the existing atom bomb. They vary from the 50 mentioned by the hon. Member to 1,000 times. This carries the anxious forebodings of the hon. Gentleman to an even deeper level. I in no way dissociate myself from his anxiety as to the future of the human race.

1947-10-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-23;Royal Navy (Strength);84;What is the actual strength of the Home Fleet at the present time? Is it true, as was stated in an announcement by the B.B.C. before the week-end, and consequently repeated to the Press of the world, that the Home Fleet consists of only one cruiser and four destroyers at the present time? That is the first question I would venture to ask. The right hon. Gentleman, as a result of the statement he has made, has thrown very little light on the position.
1947-10-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-23;Royal Navy (Strength);58;On what authority was this statement made by the B.B.C.? On whose authority was it stated that the Home Fleet would be reduced to what is called a "striking force" of one cruiser and four battle destroyers—not battleships? On whose authority was this statement, so likely to be injurious to our interests all over the world, put up?
1947-10-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-23;Royal Navy (Strength);183;I should like to ask the Minister of Defence why this unauthorised report was not in the first place immediately corrected, because great harm was done to our interests all over the world by the idea that we had only one cruiser and four destroyers maintained in our Home Fleet. I should also like to ask how it is, if this is to be the case for the time being, with over 170,000 men at present, and working on the basis of 140,000 men on Vote A right up to the end of the next financial year, which appears in the statement the right hon. Gentleman has just made, and with an expenditure of £180 million, or something like that, he is not able to maintain in commission a proper squadron of ships, with battleships and so forth, during this period? Is the failure of the Government to do that not a proof  of the gross mismanagement and incompetence which has characterised the control of the Fighting Forces since the war, and, I am sorry to say, afflicted the right hon. Gentleman's administration.

1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;213;I think that everybody in this House realises the gravity of the position, and there is no denying that there is widespread anxiety in the country with regard to our air defences and to the methods pursued by the Ministry. I think that that anxiety would have been lessened if the Noble Lord had met the matter a little more frankly, with some confession of past failures. He was too uniformly loyal. Loyalty is an admirable characteristic, and it is one of the Noble Lord's most outstanding characteristics; but he carried his loyalty to such a pitch that he was really quite unconvincing. This is not a question that is raised by just a few partisans; it is not raised by just a few disgruntled or interested persons. I was sorry that the Noble Lord laid so much stress on that. He seemed to think that the whole of this criticism, or a very large part of it, came from this or that firm, and that we were being led away in our criticism by interested persons. It did not seem to occur to him that many of us have a great volume of evidence on these matters, and that not one of us would take the mere word of an interested person.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;64;I doubt whether those Members are so misapprehensive. I have found them right before. This is a matter of grave public concern, and everyone is in a difficulty in dealing with it on the Floor of the House. We do not know how much possible enemies may know. The Government say that they cannot say anything. It is difficult for us to say anything.

1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;175;We have a production of something like 250 a month. Look at the comparison of the Great War. I am aware that aeroplanes are now more complicated. I am also aware that in the Great War there was a terrific strain to find people to produce the necessary munitions for the Navy, Army and Air Force. Yet in the War we started with little experience and had only 113 aeroplanes, and we worked up to an output of 1,229 a month, and in four years to 2,668 a month. We built over 55,000 aeroplanes during the War. That was a terrific expansion. Why has so little been done in the last three years? There must be something wrong when the results are so puny. In the War we had a very slight start. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping talked about the seed time, but in that seed time there was the sowing of wild oats. Until you get the organisation of munitions supply you will not really begin to overtake these difficulties.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;215;I am very glad to hear that, but we shall know better when we get delivery of the planes. My information is that the organisation is bad and that the workers are complaining of time being wasted, not of money being wasted. I should like to ask a good many questions with regard to instruments. There is the question of blind flying. I am not in the least satisfied with the statement we have had about blind flying. We have had the definite statement that blind flying apparatus was not being fitted to obsolete machines, only to new ones, but as only a comparatively small proportion of the squadrons have been provided with new planes, and these only recently, it follows that very few pilots have had any experience in blind flying. I can-  not understand why it should take these years to advocate these instruments. One of the complaints that has come to me is that although these things are being used in other countries, the authorities in this country took a long time to adopt them. I am told by an experienced officer that the fact is you may say that our Air Force is a fair weather force. Until quite recently it has not done any blind flying. That is extremely unsatisfactory.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;54;The hon. and gallant Member knows perfectly well that there are votes which are delivered for a particular purpose and do not necessarily carry any meaning. In the same way votes against the Estimates in July have never been held to mean that those who so vote are refusing all supplies of the country.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;7;The answer to that is very simple.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;11;The Government eventually assured the House that there was no emergency.

In these circumstances, I would ask the indulgence of the House not to press me to try to say anything until we have further and fuller information.
1953-6-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-6-18;Korea (Escape Of Prisoners Of War);42;I was both shocked and grieved to read this report.

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;187;We have an uncertain shake of the head from the Minister. The assurances have been given all over the country, and repeated everywhere, that this is the maximum scale of cuts that is to be imposed—those contained in the Schedule to this Order. Where do we stand? I was very much struck with that uncertain lateral movement of the Minister's head. Does the right hon. Gentleman know where he is? [HON. MEMBERS:" Yes."] Then, rejoicing in that happy position, let him tell us where we are. Where do we stand on this question of future reductions of the present bread ration scale? Why be afraid to tell the British public the truth? If we have to take it, we can take it, but a Government that is afraid to tell people what they are going to be up against, will  not get the confidence of those people enduring the hardships. I am glad to see the hon. Lady the Member for West Fulham (Dr. Edith Summerskill) taking her place and hope that she has completely recovered from the distressing accident about which we were all much concerned.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;137;Why it should be kept a secret till then, I do not know I only asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he was going to keep his word or not, but if he likes to reserve himself on that point, very well. We contrast the smallness of the saving with the immense amount of hardship, and we are left wondering what is the reason for this violent act, unless there is to be a big increase in the cut. On the statements which have been made to us, the need is not apparent, and if the need be proved, the remedy appears wholly in-  effective. It is like using a steamhammer to crack a nut when there is nothing in the nut. That is the impression we have so far derived from all we have been told.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;233;The right hon. Gentleman has said so. I am very glad of  that. I rejoice at that. Never will I have any emotion but joy and relief at anything which helps our country. If there had been a great breakdown, or something terrible going to break out upon us now, some skeleton in the right hon. Gentleman's cupboard going to leap out, I would still have counselled him to let it out at once, and not be frightened about it. But as I understand that he will give an answer which is reassuring on this point, namely, that the pipeline will not tall below 800,000 tons before 31st August, I can only tell him that, so far as I am able to obtain any information on the subject, that was the answer I expected him to give. If that is so, where is the case for imposing this rationing scheme on 21st July? If it is said that there is a great saving, that is an argument. If one says that some terrible thing is about to happen and that we must have the scheme now, that is an argument. If it is said that we are putting it into operation and will have to make it more severe in the future, that is an argument. But all these arguments arc demolished. What then is the argument for bread rationing on 21st July?
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;61;Before the right hon. Gentleman gets to that, he is surely going to tell us what wheat he does count on coming from Canada in the month of September.

1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;54;I said that in wartime, when there was a general or partial re-construction, it was not thought necessary for Ministers to make statements. But this is surely a matter to cheer the hon. Member whose pacifist tendencies are so well known. We are now at peace, and we are about to celebrate its joys—
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;235;I accept with pleasure the hon. Gentleman's statement that he prefers peace to war, and that his preference is remarkably pronounced and manifested on a great many occasions. But peacetime is what we are supposed to be  dwelling in now, and I submit that all the precedents of peacetime oblige a Minister to make a statement when he retires from office. I cannot, in my long experience, remember many cases to the contrary. If we look back before the war there were three most recent cases. There was the resignation of my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden)—that will cheer up Members opposite; they clutch at straws—in 1937, accompanied by that of Lord Cranborne, a member of the Government, both of whose explanations were received in a most grave and attentive spirit by the House. Then there was the resignation of Mr. Duff Cooper, now Ambassador in Paris, after the Munich crisis. Again, a very full and moving explanation was given to the House. This is the first case, in peacetime, of the resignation of a Cabinet Minister, and I say that those are precedents which should be followed. Not only should they be followed on this occasion, but they should be followed in the future. I thought it my duty to give full notice to the ex-Minister of Food, and I wrote to him this letter two days ago: 
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;282;The failure of the wheat supply of the world is not due to a shortage in any one particular country. It is due to a shortage in particular countries, but it is not due to any general failure of the world crop. That is a very essential point. The conditions in the British zone in Germany should have been foreseen beforehand. The story is indeed a tragic one. At the end of the Potsdam Conference, the Russians and Poles were allowed to occupy up to the Western Neisse, and not the Eastern Neisse, and another great influx of hungry and homeless people, numbered by millions, was driven into the British zone. The British zone is the least favourably circumstanced from a food point of view. There is the least agriculture and the most manufacture. There you have the great population of the ruined Ruhr. We have a more difficult task in our zone even than, the United States in theirs. The great feeding grounds which nourished Germany as a whole lie to the East of the iron curtain, and food supplies have not been sent from there to the population of Germany as a whole, to whom they belong, and which should have been reserved for their nourishment. On top of this has come this incursion of a very large additional number of hungry, suffering people. This had all been foreseen, because it arose out of decisions which were reached at Potsdam. I am not making this a matter of serious complaint; personally, I would not have agreed to it, although I might not have been able to prevent the establishment of the Western Neisse as the frontier between Poland and Germany.
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;22;The right" hon. Gentleman should do me the justice of noting that I personally declared that he was ill-used in the matter.

1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;45;Is that true about bread? I thought that was quite exceptional, because it is the poorest people who eat most bread. They have less choice of diet and, therefore, the rationing of bread, like a bread tax, hits the poorest people much harder than others.
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;103;I would like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman upon the eloquence with which he moved us during the latter part of his speech, and although I think his views of the outlook were exaggerated, it is certainly better for a Minister to begin in a difficult office of this character in a spirit of facing, and even magnifying, difficulties, rather than in a lighthearted spirit, expressing hopes which may not afterwards be fulfilled. I always find, myself, that the British nation will never forgive optimism that is not borne out, but that if pessimism is not borne out one's previous inaccuracies are forgiven.

The appointment of the Minister of State will not interfere with  the existing relationships between the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East and the Service Ministers, or between His Majesty's Ambassador, Cairo, and other representatives of His Majesty's Government in the Middle East, and the Ministers in this country to whom they are responsible. The Minister of State will make reference home whenever necessary on important issues of policy; but it is to be hoped that the presence of a War Cabinet Minister with wide discretionary powers will smooth, hasten, and concert action in the Middle East between the various authorities in that area.

His business is to serve the Commander-in-Chief with the largest possible measure of supplies in accordance with the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief and the needs of the Army, and also in accordance with the practical business of handling the great mass of supplies arriving from this country and the United States, and the Minister of State will have the benefit of the advice of Sir Robert Haining in anything which may touch this part of his duty. I would say that the kind of relations which I hope to see between the Minister of State and the Intendant-General on the one hand, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army on the other, are very largely the sort of relations  which prevail in the matter of supplies between the War Office and the Ministry of Supply in this country and General Sir Alan Brooke, commanding the Army in the United Kingdom.

I do not mean physically but morally and mentally. When we look back at what has happened, and the long time that has been required by the Committee to discuss these Clauses, we can see how monstrously unfair was the proposal he made, which he tried through the usual channels to get us to adopt, that we should have finished Clause 31 by 12.15 last night.

Revenge is a dangerous and costly motive. The idea of saying, "You did not let us finish up at a quarter to midnight, therefore we will give you a bigger dose than any you administered to us," shows that the right hon.

The task of dealing with perishable foods is duly proceeding to the requirements of the Ministry of Food. Work is also proceeding on the part of some of the workers at Surrey, Blackfriars, West India and Tooley Street Docks and efforts are being made to obtain a fuller resumption of work. It is clear that the continued strike is the only bar to an examination of any grievances that may be felt. I would ask that I should not be pressed for any further statement this afternoon.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;52;Troops are being used in accordance with the demands of the Ministry of Food. Other Armed Forces will be brought in if necessary. The necessity is not very great at the present time, because, although there were certain perishable foodstuffs, the Armed Forces were there, and the men did the work yesterday.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;57;It is obvious that one cannot, at a moment's notice, replace the whole number of men at the docks, but all preparations are made, if the stoppage should continue, for bringing in more men from the Services. At the present moment, those who are there are put in to meet the requirements of the Ministry of Food.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;20;We are not waiting. There are some 7,000 men now at work, and I hope to see a further resumption.

1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;63;No, Sir. I have already said that it is perfectly open to raise that question of disciplinary action, but the particular cases have been dealt with under the machinery that has been set up. The full resources have been brought in, and the question has gone to appeal, not once but twice. It is quite impossible to suggest that it should be re-opened.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;90;Could the right hon. Gentleman, who has asked us not to press the matter now, state what is the nature of the impending or current negotiations which are going forward which requires him to say that this matter ought not to be discussed now? We have had this same reason given day after day, but the strike has continued, and I think some more precise and substantial reason should be given to us if we are not to press for this matter to be further considered at the present time.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;40;There are, of course, no negotiations with the unofficial strikers.

If there are 150 ships accumulating and awaiting discharge, why, after all this, should not the full strength of what are called Service personnel be used to unload these ships and procure the clearance of the port and a cessation of the paralysis which grips it at present? Some sort of reason ought to be given us, though we do not want to have an awkward discussion which would embarrass the Government. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman in refusing to give way to the demands made against the legitimate trade union, but we really ought to have something more solid than has been given to us so far.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;70;There is no question of not bringing in men to do this work. The right hon.

1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;7;I think I made that statement yesterday.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;26;The short reply is that there is no question of not meeting the men's representatives. The union representatives have been met by the Ministry of Labour.

1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;50;Certainly. I never suggested that the steps taken should be limited to the movement of perishable foods. That was the first matter that had to be dealt with.

A standing committee has been set up to advise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland on questions affecting the industry as a whole in time of war, and in particular the maintenance and distribution of supplies. It has been possible to return a number of requisitioned vessels to the industry as they have been relieved by other vessels. The question of purchasing and building further trawlers for the industry is being actively pursued.
1939-11-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-11-01;Fishing Industry (Assistance);26;No, Sir. I think the herring fishery was not part of the conference, which dealt more particularly with other aspects of the protection of the country.

The House should, I think, take formal cognisance of the liberation of Rome by the Allied Armies under the Command of General Alexander, with General Clark of the United States Service and General Oliver Leese in command of the Fifth and Eighth Armies respectively. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] This is a memorable and glorious event, which rewards the intense fighting of the last five months in Italy. The original landing, made on 22nd January at Anzio, has, in the end, borne good fruit. In the first place, Hitler was induced to send to the south of Rome eight or nine divisions which he may well have need of elsewhere. Secondly, these divisions were repulsed, and their teeth broken, by the successful resistance of the Anzio bridgehead forces in the important battle which took place in the middle of February. The losses on both sides were heavy—the Allies losing about 20,000 men, and the Germans about 25,000 men. Thereafter, the Anzio bridgehead was considered by the enemy to be impregnable.

I think he was extremely just in the statement he made, in which he said it would be quite wrong to ignore the rights of the electors, but here we have this alteration in our procedure made not for some overriding circumstance arising out of the needs of the State but for party convenience, and for the convenience of a party whose authority rests on an election ten years ago won on a policy which was betrayed, and won by a party which had to be superseded by an all-party Government headed by the man it rejected.

However, the German Command has agreed to the Belgian proposals and the Belgian Army ceased to resist the enemy's will at four o'clock this morning. I have no intention of suggesting to the House that we should attempt at this moment to pass judgment upon the action of the King of the Belgians in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Army. This Army has fought very bravely and has both suffered and inflicted heavy losses. The Belgian Government has dissociated itself from the action of the King and declaring itself to be the only legal Government of Belgium, has formally announced its resolve to continue the war at the side of the Allies who have come to the aid of Belgium at her urgent appeal. Whatever our feelings may be upon the facts so far as they are known to us, we must remember that the sense of brotherhood between the many peoples who have fallen into the power of the aggressor and those who still confront him will play its part in better days than those through which we are passing.

I am by no means sure on the spur of the moment that the Minister of Defence, among other Departments, was not consulted in the final stages.

I must say that in Alan Moorehead—who I understand was at one time publicity officer to the Ministry of Defence—one could hardly have had a more trustworthy author.

My right hon. and gallant Friend with whom we have communicated suggests that the Question may refer to a remark, which was in effect what he had already said in this House on 13th July, namely that there could be no reality in self-government without the ability to be financially independent. As a general statement this seems to be unexceptionable.
1943-10-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-12;Colonies (Self-Government);26;Well, and we have the advantage of knowing direct from the Secretary of State for the Colonies what is the position in principle which he adopts.

It is impossible to draft a Bill amending existing legislation without referring to that legislation. The Bill referred to by the hon. Member sets up a new Board on whom it is proposed to confer, subject to certain necessary modifications, the powers under existing legislation of authorised undertakers and of the Central Electricity Board. As the hon. Member is aware, the Bill as introduced proposed that the necessary modifications of the existing legislation should be made by Order in Council; and it was in deference to views expressed by hon. Members that amendments were put down by the Government to make the necessary modifications by the Bill itself. It is necessary to apply no less than 13 separate enactments comprising 299 Sections and 13 Schedules.  To have set out in a Schedule the whole of these enactments with the proposed modifications would have resulted in the production of a Bill which, by its mere bulk, would be more difficult for Members to understand than the Bill in its present form with the amendments proposed. As regards the last part of the Question, the draftsmen of Government Bills have constantly in mind the proposals made in 1938 and all other available methods of making amending legislation as lucid as possible.

1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;65;No, I had no right or authority to propose a three-Power meeting any more than we have today. I was proposing a two-Power meeting, an informal meeting between me and my right hon. Friend on the one hand and Mr. Malenkov and Mr. Molotov, on the other hand, or anyone else they chose to bring, at some neutral place where we could talk over things.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;86;I was not cross. I voted for the unanimous Resolution which mentioned a three-Power conference, but I do not think that now is a good opportunity to stress that point when these critical discussions are going on in France. I carefully stated, if I remember rightly, that I was sure no offence was meant—but it would be tactless to do it now, and that is one of the reasons why I prefer our Amendment to the Motion of censure. That is what I am arguing about.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;86;I think I have trespassed too much on the great kindness and indulgence of the House to allow me to go so far back over the past. I think that if I were to try to explain the motives which animated me every time I have been called upon to address a public meeting in this country, I should be going really too far and would lose at once the patience of the House and that general attitude of indulgence which I have received from it.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;33;Why is it impracticable now, although it does not seem to have been thought impracticable when the Prime Minister first proposed it, and when Western European defence had not been organised at all?
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;61;The hon. Gentleman was making the point, not that it had not been proposed, but that it had not been ratified. The hon. Member made the point that to propose talks now would be a sign of great weakness. A fortiori, it would have been equally weak if Western European defence had not been conceived and was not there at all.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;59;The hon. Member is making heavy weather of this.

Gentleman. For all these reasons, it is most certainly true that the occasion is not entirely unmingled with joy, for the country sees so many who have changed their courses, but I say that we are now asked to approve this Atlantic Pact, and the only opposition to it is expected from that small band of Communists, crypto-Communists and fellow-travellers whose dimensions have been very accurately ascertained in recent times.

1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-07;Cost Of Living;70;I really think this ought to be put quite plainly, because we see in the papers that questions have been raised as to whether Marshall Aid should be continued now, and a statement like that coming from the Home Secretary at this moment may conceivably lead to decisions which I was not aware, from anything we have been told, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is either expecting or welcoming.

The destruction of U-boat bases is an essential part of this strategy. Very heavy blows have already been delivered by the R.A.F. and the United States Army Air Corps against the U-boat bases, both in Germany and in occupied France. We have repeatedly urged the French population to leave coastal areas. A large part of the civil population of Brest and Lorient have in fact been evacuated, and the Germans have attempted to conceal the severity of the raids from the German crews expected to use Lorient. The qualities of resistance displayed by the French people day by day are well known, and I have no doubt that they will understand that operations such as the bombing of Lorient will bring victory nearer and thus hasten the day of France's deliverance.

The Government have just announced a new policy on the disposal of compulsorily acquired land, and there is to be a comprehensive inquiry into the Ministry of Agriculture's  methods of dealing with transactions in agricultural land. We must await the result of the inquiry and see the effect of these measures before instituting wider investigations.

There is now four years' very intensive and specialised training. Is that being thrown over, and are we coming down to two and a half years? I may have misunderstood the hon.

I am sure that this is the best arrangement that could be made, as in addition to his far-reaching connections with every aspect of merchant shipbuilding, he filled a place in this same Department during the late war with conspicuous success. I proposed that he should receive a salary equal to that of the Controller of the Navy, but he has wished to give his services without remuneration. He has also resigned his position upon the Board of National Shipbuilders' Security, Limited, and has obtained leave of absence, with two exceptions, from the boards of all other companies of which he is either chairman or director.

1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);138;His Majesty's Government are as concerned as anyone else with the security of the communications of the British Commonwealth and Empire, with the security of the Canal, and with the best possible relations with Egypt and the continuance of our alliance with that country; and it is precisely for that reason that we are making the approach that we are making. Let me record briefly a little bit more of the history of our relations with the Egyptian people. They have sometimes been good; sometimes not so good. I can recall the course of those relations over  a good many years in this House. I remember very well the efforts that were made to try and get an agreement when Mr. Arthur Henderson was Foreign Secretary, and that nearly succeeded in 1929. A difficult period followed after that.
1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);9;I thought the right hon. Gentleman made that treaty.

Gentleman was referring to a later treaty; I thought it was the 1921–22 Treaty. But I should say that even those ports would have been of little use to us if, as a matter of fact, it had led to strong hostility among the people of the country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That is, I believe, the fact. We are proposing this, first of all, because in the preliminary exchanges of views which have taken place between the British and Egyptian negotiators, and on the basis of the advice which we have received from all those who are in a position to give us advice, or very well qualified by long knowledge of Egypt—all the advice given to us has convinced us that in order that the alliance should continue with the same mutual confidence and success as in the past, it is essential to take as the departure the complete freedom and independence of Egypt.

1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);137;Yes, certainly. What we are endeavouring to work out with the Egyptians is how we can best get those facilities; how, and in what time, it will be possible to withdraw our troops and get rid of the very large installations that we have there; and how, with them, we can arrange to carry out our obligations for the defence of the Canal. I entirely agree with what the right hon. Gentleman has said about our responsibility in this matter, and we are trying to arrange the best possible way of fulfilling our responsibilities. That can only be done with the hearty good will of the Egyptian people, and in this matter the period of the withdrawal of our Forces will be a matter to be worked out by experts. It depends on physical and administrative factors.
1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);55;Yes, I brought this draft before the Dominion Prime Ministers and discussed it with them. [HON. MEMBERS: "Did they agree?"] Well, I did not come to this House to—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—His Majesty's Government take full responsibility.

I am saying they were fully consulted.

The Treaty was signed in 1936, the barracks were to take several years to build, and, very quickly, came Munich, and, the next year, the war came.

1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);15;What I said was that obviously if negotiations break down, the original Treaty still stands.
1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);206;Yes, I see. Then the negotiations are for the purpose of securing a satisfactory defence of the Canal zone in a manner most agreeable to Egyptian sentiment. If they break down, then we revert to the 1936 Treaty. That is a very important admission, and I am bound to say it relieves my anxiety to some extent, but it in no way improves the view which we take of the method by which the Government intend to handle this matter. They begin by saying, "We will withdraw the troops." They go on to say, "If the Canal zone is not properly defended, we revert to the 1936 Treaty with the troops on the Canal zone." But who has ever suggested that there is any method of safeguarding the Canal except by troops in the Canal zone? You will not get any military man of eminence and responsibility to say that the Canal can be kept open—because that is the whole point; it is to keep the Canal open. Anyone can close the Canal from hundreds of miles away; it is to keep it open that we require  troops on the spot, not only when danger has come but in the months before the storm has burst.

He says there was an agreement about the universities, because he was of the opinion that the university Members in the last Parliament were non-party, but that, since the election, because two Conservatives have been elected, he considers there has been a breach of that agreement. He wants, therefore, to abolish the representation of the universities. [Interruption.] Surely, that is the position which he has taken up? Is not this an attempt to affront, and even intimidate, the free voting in very large constituencies of men who have had the advantage of graduating at a university, and can this be the basis of such a change?

Friend upon his appointment to one of the four or five great key offices of the State, and to express to him—I have known him for so many years—not only my good wishes for his success, but my confidence that his abilities will be found of distinguished service to the country in his new office. The matter which we have to discuss tonight has been thrust upon us at rather short notice. It is quite true that we are familiar with the 1935 Treaty, but the important Russian and German papers, which are very bulky and very technical, were only in the Vote Office at seven o'clock last night, and it is rather severe that Members whose duty it is to follow and take an interest in these matters should not have a little longer notice of the fact. However, as the Session is drawing to its close some of this telescoping probably is necessary, but these are very large and complex matters, and it is much better that publication of matters of interest to the British Government should be in the Vote Office at least a week, if it is possible, before the House is asked to adopt them. But I bring that forward in no captious spirit, because on the whole I have very little to say against this arrangement, as we now see it, and, having regard to all that has gone before, something to say in its favour.
1937-7-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-20;London Naval Treaty Bill;242;I am talking about the new programme. Suppose they solve the problem in a satisfactory manner, as they may do, then we must be ready to make a change. Do not let us be told that we are to lose another three years because we have not made our preparations. That is the point upon which I want to make an appeal. Will the First Lord now make sure that he begins the preparations for all the alterations to gun plant which will be required in the event of an advance to the 16-inch gun being considered necessary, and will he have constructed an experimental 16-inch gun mounting in order that everything may be  in readiness? Then, it we find that other countries have solved this problem, which we have not, and we are forced to go forward with the higher guns, there will be no further delay. I make a strong appeal that this preliminary work should be set in train at once. In this matter, as in others, you can see how naval agreements and treaties hamper and cripple British initiative. It is true that if other people take steps which we hoped they would not take we have freedom to take fresh steps, but we have always waited for a year or two and then when an advance has been made upon us in cruisers and battleships by other countries invoke the escalator clause and take the next step.
1947-5-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-5-06;Clause 1—(Liability To Be Called Up For Service);288;As to the ethics of war and the ethics of society, we are all in favour of the ethics of society. The reason why this Bill was brought forward is that we were so worried lest the ethics of society should be upset by the ethics of war. I must return to the question, and the Committee must consider it, of how much greater sacrifice it would impose on citizens to begin this strain at 21 and run on to 28, than to begin it at 18, when it is part, almost, of the educational system. There can be no comparison of the two. From the point of view of the social application of this compulsory service, I certainly do not wish to fasten on to the hon. Gentleman, who made his  speech from the highest possible motives, any desire to cast a slur upon the Army; but things change as time goes on. The Army is a very different business now from what it was in the days when a red coat was not allowed inside a public house, and was treated as the scum of the population, until a war broke out, and he had to go and fight, and then he was a hero. It is very different now. A national Army is quite different from an Army of volunteers, who were produced largely by the pressure in the economic market. I am all for volunteers who come from some uplifting of the human soul, some spirit arising in the human breast, but to create a modern Army on a voluntary basis, by the mere pressure of the economic system, is entirely contrary to the kind of world on which our outlook is now fastened.

His Majesty has been pleased to approve the appointment of the right honourable Richard Gardiner Casey, D.S.O., M.C., to be Minister of State. Mr. Casey will be a member of the War Cabinet of the United Kingdom, and will represent the War Cabinet in the Middle East, where he will concert, on their behalf, the measures necessary for the prosecution of the war in that area, other than the conduct of operations. Mr. Casey will be described as Minister of State in the Middle East. Mr. Casey is at present Australian Minister in Washington; and I wish, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, to express our thanks to the Commonwealth Government for their consent to release Mr. Casey at this juncture from his important duties in the United States.

1942-3-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-19;Minister Of State In The Middle East (Mr Casey's Appointment);49;I am not able to answer that last point; but, as far as this House is concerned, a Member of the War Cabinet will answer for him.

1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);71;Did the right hon.

1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);82;I think the right hon. Gentleman is incorrect in two respects. The question of closer unity in Western Europe has been considered, not only by The Hague Conference, but by the Governments concerned, and very practical steps have been taken by this Government in that direction. Secondly, my right hon.

1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);30;Is it not a fact that in his speeches the right hon. Gentleman has said that Western European unity is conditional on its being founded upon a Socialist Party basis?

1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);7;I disagree with the right hon. Gentleman.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);95;I think King Henry IV of Navarre was the first. There is one of these names which the Prime Minister read out about which I should like to ask him particularly, and that is the name of Sir Edward Bridges. Is it not rather a serious thing, and rather unfair to the distinguished gentleman in question, to involve the Permanent Head of the Civil Service of this country in controversy and partisan politics and in foreign politics, and did this not produce unfortunate results in the Civil Service in the case of Sir Horace Wilson?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);95;The right hon. Gentleman himself has suggested this danger with regard to the position of Sir Edward Bridges. It is really quite normal for Governments to employ civil servants when they have Government representatives going to a conference. I have never heard it suggested previously that, in the case of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden), if he was attending an international conference and took a civil servant with him, that therefore that civil servant was considered to be a Conservative. It is the right hon. Gentleman's own prejudice.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);43;Is not the right hon. Gentleman overlooking and slurring over the difference between civil servants engaged in Departments who only attend their Ministers, if necessary, in the course of Departmental duties, and involving the Permanent Head of the Civil Service in controversial politics?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);50;the phrase "controversial politics" comes entirely from the right hon. Gentleman. It is one of the right hon. Gentleman's curious prejudices that, if there happens to be a Labour Government, that is partisan, but, if there is a Conservative Government or a Government headed by himself, it is not partisan.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);119;When the right hon. Gentleman accuses me of partisanship, does he realise that all the other Governments under the Brussels Treaty and Agreement have sent all-party delegations, in which the most eminent statesmen and former Prime Ministers of those countries have been involved, and that the French, in particular, have sent M. Leon Blum, M. Herriot and other very prominent representatives; and that,  in consequence, in choosing a representation of officials acting under instructions, he is putting himself and his party out of step, very much against the views of many of them, with the general movement to build up European unity, and is it not unfair to involve Sir Edward Bridges in a partisan transaction of that character?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);98;I have tried to explain to the right hon. Gentleman, in reply to the letter he was good enough to send me, that in the case of France there is a Government composed of many parties. It is not surprising, therefore, that they have representatives of those parties—[An HON. MEMBER: "And outside."] I also pointed out to him, and hon. Members will note this, that four of these members are not Members of Parliament or representatives of the Government directly. It must also be pointed out that there are no representatives of the Chief Opposition parties in France.

The chief Opposition parties are not represented; therefore, the right hon.

1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);55;I thought that was perfectly obvious. If the right hon.

1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);65;I have already explained this matter. I naturally did not answer on the spur of the moment. I naturally asked my right hon.

1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);52;I am answering the hon. and learned Member for Hove (Mr. Marlowe). I think that it is a perfectly fair comment, on looking at the scheme, to say that one would be putting into the hands of an irresponsible authority powers to deal on a very wide basis with all these industries.
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);47;is not the essential point whether the word"plot" covered the Schuman proposal? What other proposals were there before the public at the time, except the Schuman proposal we had just been debating? Surely the right hon. Gentleman will consider his own position very carefully in this matter.
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);58;Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that in the statement he has just made, he has made a considerable, albeit only a partial, advance towards the policy which we on this side of the House declared at the General Election? On 29th November we stated, in the "Unionist Policy for the Effective Control in Scotland of Scottish Affairs": 
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);110;That was 29th November; that date is quite easy to take in. Will not the right hon. Gentleman consider whether, while he is deferring to our wishes to a certain extent, he will not go the whole way and, instead of appointing what he calls a strong and independent Committee, appoint a Royal Commission, which is what we have demanded? Perhaps he has received some legal advice. At any rate, will he say whether he will appoint a Royal Commission and then we should be able, on this side of the House, to congratulate ourselves on having at any rate secured this measure of consideration for a vital Scottish matter?
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);30;No, Sir, the right hon. Gentleman has no right to suggest that this is a method of delaying. He and his party have been forced into action by our pressure.
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);36;The right hon. Gentleman did not tell us the terms of reference. Can he give us the terms of reference, and are we to take it that he has definitely decided to refuse a Royal Commission?
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);13;What I said carried forward all I had said on the subject previously.

Why will the right hon. Gentleman persist in refusing the plain demand which is made, and was made six months ago, before the election, for the setting up of a Royal Commission?
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);52;I should like, if I might, to assure the right hon. Gentleman that part of my anxiety in this matter is due to my desire that the reputation which he acquired in a subordinate position at the  Foreign Office shall not be squandered now that he is the head of a Department.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;252;The Foreign Secretary in his closing sentences expressed a desire for a unity of attitude in this country on foreign affairs, but the speech which he has just delivered has widened the gulf which existed between this party and the party opposite. I have heard a number of speeches by the right hon. Gentleman, but I have never heard such a cynical pronouncement as that which he has just made. In his earlier speeches in this House he used to uphold the ideal of the League of Nations and the ideal of the rule of law. He seemed to have some idea that there should be at least a distinction between right and wrong in foreign affairs. Throughout this speech he has emphasised all the time that the only thing which affects His Majesty's Government is the interests of British Imperialism. He has emphasised that it  is the only thing on which a risk should be taken. By doing so, he has illustrated very clearly the entire difference in outlook between the Government and the Members of this party. I want to develop that point a little later, and I shall show how, in every sphere of foreign politics on which he has touched, that prime difference comes out that this party stands for the rule of law and for the development of a commonwealth of nations, and that the Government are back in pre-war days, considering only, and narrowly, what they consider—I believe quite falsely—to be the interests of this country.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;282;I am very glad to have that assurance. I sent a message to the right hon. Gentleman which I hope reached him, asking him to deal with this subject in his speech. I hope that this will be done for the women and children, despite any opposition from General Franco, because the slaughter of women and children is not a legitimate act of war. In the same way, there is the question of the surrender of troops, and whether they can be taken to be unarmed in order to save their lives. If there were a land frontier, the troops could reach it and be interned, as happened in Holland in the later days of the War but in this case they are faced with the sea. The fact is that there is a danger that the whole of these brave men may he slaughtered because it happens to be a sea front and not a land front. Here, again, I believe it is of the utmost importance that our Government, in conjunction with other Governments, should do the utmost to save these people, not only because of the people themselves, but to prevent the exacerbation of the whole civil war position in Spain. A civil war is a horrible one at any time, but if an atrocity of this kind takes place it might lead to other  atrocities. I am sure the Valencia Government will do all they can to stop it, but they will have this terrible exacerbation of strife, and I do ask that our Government should show as much resolution when they are dealing with a question of humanity as they would for the interests of British shipping.

I do not think he has realised the strength of the national feeling in Spain any more than he realised the strength of the national feeling in India, and I do not think he realises yet the national feeling in China. But I think we ought to recognise here and now that you can have no possible  judgment between the combatants in Spain until there has been a complete withdrawal of foreign troops.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;196;I think the place to make statements is in this House. I made the same speech twice in Trafalgar Square as I made here. I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the attitude of the United States is of the very first importance, and the fact that they are going to meet with us in this Nine-Power Conference is of vital importance. I believe this adventure of Japan's is only undertaken because of the attitude of this and other Governments in always letting the aggressors get away with it. I believe there is great opposition in Japan. Japan's financial position is extremely weak and Japan's economic position is extremely weak. If one tithe of the consideration which is shown about British shipping in the Mediterranean was shown about the Japanese invasion of China, I believe this invasion would stop. This is a deliberate piece of aggression by one Power against another, and all through the Government wash their hands of the matter. Either they say "it is a matter in which we cannot take sides" or else, as was hinted in a speech by the Foreign Secretary, "we are too weak to do anything."
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;214;That is just the weakness of the right hon. Gentleman. He always believes any kind of propaganda that is put out against us. Japan also says that she is out for peace. Does he believe that? I do not believe for a moment that Japan would challenge the world. The world has given its verdict at Geneva. A verdict like that, followed by no action, is perfectly useless. The Prime Minister has said that the question involved is the sanctity of treaties, but the Government has torn up a number of treaties. So far from this Government having brought this country into safety and security, I believe it has jeopardised our security, and the right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong when he believes there is any kind of unity behind this Government. There will be no unity behind this Government so long as it pursues a policy which is entirely divorced from the realities of the situation, entirely divorced from any idea of collective security and the rule of law, and is directed only by a short-sighted view of Imperial interests. We can assure him that he will meet with opposition from this side so long as he and his Government pursue the kind of policy they have pursued over the last five years.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;304;The House always listens with pleasure to a speech from the hon. Member who has just addressed us, because he is always good tempered and always convinces us that he is speaking with complete sincerity. But good temper and sincerity are not sufficient to make an accurate analysis of the complicated foreign situation or to formulate a policy. If the hon. Member will forgive me, I should like to say that he is in the position in which the Leader of the Opposition accused the Government of being, namely, that he seems to me to be completely divorced from reality. He is a victim of phrases and words. He uses words over and over again without, it seems to me, making clear what he means by those words. He says that the Government have no policy, that he can never understand their foreign policy. What does the hon. Member mean by foreign policy? You can lay down sound and general propositions. You can say that your foreign policy is to maintain peace; you can say that it is to protect British interests, you can say that it is to use your influence, such as it is, on behalf of the right against the wrong, as far as you can tell the right from the wrong. You can lay down all these as general principles, but that is not a policy. Surely, if you are to have a policy you must take the particular situations and consider what action or inaction is suitable for those particular situations. That is what I myself mean by policy, and it is quite clear that as the situations and conditions in foreign affairs continually change from day to  day your policy cannot be stated once and for all if it is to be applicable to every situation that arises.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;56;I repeat that nobody knows how many there are on either side. The first thing to do is to ascertain the numbers, and if they can be ascertained by an international Commission, as is proposed, then the proposal is that the withdrawals shall be in the proportion of those numbers as found on the two sides.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;79;That was not stated in the Italian Note. Is the Commission to go on and make arrangements for a total withdrawal? The Italian suggestion was that first there should be a withdrawal of man for man on each side, and what I was asking was what would be the  amount, because if I am correct, or if the general reports are correct, there are four or five times as many on the rebel side as on the Government side.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;122;That is the point that I was coming to. Let us be quite clear. The ultimate proposal is that all the volunteers should be withdrawn, and if that is so, obviously there must be more on one side withdrawn than on the other, if the numbers are greater on one side than on the other. The only question, therefore, is what is to happen in the meantime. It may take some time, and surely we are not going to wait and have no withdrawals at all until these figures are accurately ascertained. Therefore, the proposal is that what is called a token withdrawal should take place, of a comparatively small number, and that that number should be equal on the two sides.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;16;That is exactly what my point was—what kind of amount is meant by a token withdrawal.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;162;I said a comparatively trifling or small amount, but the number has not actually been fixed. Supposing it was 5,000. I do not say it is, for a moment—it may not be as many as that—but supposing it was 5,000 from either side, I do not think there is anything unfair in that. The surplus of volunteers on one side would remain exactly the same as before the withdrawals. The next question of the right hon. Gentleman was whether, while this withdrawal was taking place, it would be open to other Powers to go on pouring arms and munitions or weapons into Spain. Of course, anything of the kind would stultify the whole procedure, and the proposal is this, to see that there shall be no further intervention while withdrawals are taking place. Anyhow, the Government would not consider an arrangement at all satisfactory or acceptable which allowed further volunteers to be poured in while nominally we were withdrawing troops already there.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;42;I suggested there were certain technicalities with regard to territorial waters that had not been objected to when it was a question of rescuing Franco, but which were said to be standing in the way of rescuing the supporters of the Government.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;43;I do not want to go into that, but the right hon. Gentleman will be surprised to hear that from this town of Gijon alone we have removed no fewer than 30,000 refugees in British ships under the protection of the British flag.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Chamberlain.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;48;I thought the right hon. Gentleman must be aware that the movement of troops to Libya is carrying out a process the beginning of which was announced as long ago as April last, and we have no reason to suppose that it has any connection with current events.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Chamberlain.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;127;The Leader of the Opposition and also the right hon. Member for Caithness both expressed regret and surprise that my right hon. Friend had not spoken again of the speech which was delivered by President Roosevelt, although he and I took the first opportunity after that speech was made public of expressing our satisfaction at what President Roosevelt had said and our intention to co-operate with him as far as 1:hat might be possible. If I may quote the words I myself used, the right hon. Gentleman will see that he had no grounds for suggesting that we, in contradistinction to President Roosevelt, have no ideas and no policy and no word of welcome for the gesture made by the President from across the Atlantic. I said:

Member for Horsham (Earl Winterton) in putting a point of Order referred to a Ruling given by you, which I had not properly appreciated, to the effect that it was wrong for anyone to say that they did not trust the Government.

1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;113;The hon. Member has mentioned that he wrote me a letter on 11th March, and he was good enough, after some conversation later on with an hon. Friend who helps me with my work here, to send me a copy of the letter. I only received the copy the day before yesterday, and he only sent me the copy, because the actual letter never reached me at all. I have a very efficient staff which deals with my correspondence, but no trace of the receipt of this letter can be found. The hon. Member, therefore, did not read the letter to the House as he was good enough to tell me he intended.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;31;Last week the hon. Member sent me notice that he was going to read the letter, but, having heard that it was not received, he did not intend to read it.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;224;The letter was in no way relevant to the particular small point which led to some of our discussions. It offered no explanation why he did not address his Private Notice Question on 11th March to the Secretary of State for War, whom it concerned. Now he has explained that the reason he did not read it is because it had to be addressed to me in my capacity of Minister of Defence presiding over the three Services. But  that was not the reason he gave when he rang up my private secretary on the afternoon of 10th March. He rang up to give notice that he was going to put the Question by private notice, and he gave the text of the Question. It was taken down by one of my secretaries, and a note was made of the conversation, and he was immediately told that such a Question ought to be addressed to the Secretary of State for War. What was the reason he gave? Was it that the Minister of Defence must deal with these matters? Not at all. He said it concerned the Prime Minister's son. That is a small point, but I think it justifies me in considering that there has been a certain personal flavour in the zest with which the hon. Member has brought this thing forward.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;83;The only point of interest is that the hon. Gentleman has given a different reason for not putting the Question to the Secretary of State for War from the reason he gave to one whom I regard as a highly credible witness. There was no reason why the Question should not have been put in the ordinary course to my right hon. Friend, who would have dealt with it. I do not want to dwell unduly upon the personal aspect of the Question.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;140;The word "unduly" is arguable, but I wonder whether, if this letter in the "Evening Standard" had been written by any other hon. Member of the House, it would have attracted the energetic attention of the hon. Member who raised this matter. There are, of course, elements on both sides of the Atlantic who indulge in this form of badinage. The President of the United States presents a much larger target than I do, as he has no fewer than four sons serving, whereas I have only one. When  points are raised it is no use having all the points raised by one side and then to be told that one is dwelling unduly on those points when they are answered. I therefore leave the personal aspect while expressing all my acknowledgments to the hon. Member for his unfailing courtesy.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;75;I think I might be allowed to proceed to unfold this matter. It is a small matter, but if the hon. Member regards it as important, I will gladly give way when I have finished my sentence. The Assistant Director of Public Relations acted in this case, and he passed the letter, censored it and stamped it. The War Office considered that he exercised his discretion rightly, having regard to the contents of the document.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;46;I do not know whether that is true, but it ought not to be true if it is. In this case the letter was shown in an open way to the Assistant Director of Public Relations and was passed by him after he had examined it.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;85;That is what I have been trying to say with as much plainness as the English language allows.  That is my point. It is a new point and a different point from that which I was in a position to make on the information available last time. The letter was franked and censored by an officer entitled to take that step. Consequently, as far as the hon. and gallant Member for Preston is concerned, there is no case against him for having committed any irregularity.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;60;I think anyone who follows my argument will see that I should not think that was true. As I have said, the House can judge. The letter was a proper one, and there is no doubt it passed through channels which vouched for it, and what is the use of the hon. Member interrupting by saying "Except in North Africa"?
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;549;There is no reason at all why such a letter should not have been written by an officer serving in this country to "The Times" or to the "Observer" or any other newspaper, and if it were passed by the censor in North Africa, the North African aspect goes. I am on the larger aspect, and I had not intended to be drawn back on to this smaller point, which has such a strange fascination for the hon. Member. But certainly the answer of the Secretary of State on 16th June, 1942, does require restatement in such a way as to show the full implications both of Articles 541 and  547 upon the writing of communications to the Press by Service personnel on controversial matters. It would certainly be very detrimental to the conduct of the war if we had a general diversion of the energies of the Army from the sword to the pen, and since this discussion has had such very wide publicity it is very likely that a number of officers and men will be encouraged to utilise the opportunity. Therefore, we must make a restatement of the rule upon this point in such a way as to show the full force of Articles 541 and 547. The Admiralty rules in this matter are somewhat stricter than those of the Army, and it is for consideration whether the Army and the Air Force practice should be brought into closer conformity with that prevailing in the Navy. So much I am saying for the ordinary serving officer or soldier, here or anywhere else, but the position of Members of Parliament as representatives of the electors is quite different from that of other serving officers and soldiers. Articles 541 and 547 clearly cannot be applied in their full rigour. Members have their political responsibilities and have an undoubted right to take part in political and party controversy. That is the whole nature of their function. The House has hitherto shown itself desirous that such rights should be fully maintained. We have seen in many of our Debates serving Members taking the freest part not only in political Debates but in the military aspects of affairs, including—and this, I think, is the most questionable case of all—giving information which they have derived from the unit in which they have been serving, and no great harm has come from it. The only remedy which the War Office has against Members of Parliament exercising their political functions apart from matters affecting military security is to suggest to them that they should devote their whole attention to their military duties. Hitherto, after 42 months of war, this has never yet been found necessary in the Army. It shows, I think, how very well the system has worked as far as Members of Parliament are concerned, in spite of some obvious anomalies and the obvious difficulty of reconciling the two functions of a serving officer and a Member of this House. It has worked in this way because of the good sense and discretion of those concerned, and in view of this I cannot believe that the House would  wish any new or special restriction to be placed upon the discretion of Members of Parliament who are at the same time serving officers.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;50;That is so until and unless any further statement is made as to the tightening-up of these rules, which may be necessary if an agitation is going to be started or efforts are made to break through them. One had hoped the good sense which has hitherto prevailed would continue.

I myself have made various suggestions on the subject. Every proposal must be judged in relation to the circumstances at the time. I do not think that matters will be helped forward by repeated Questions and answers in the House of Commons. I gave a carefully considered reply on 20th October, and nothing has occurred since which enables me to add to it; but if I have at any time any information to give the House, I can assure the hon. Members who have raised the matter that I shall seek the earliest opportunity to do so.

But I cannot pretend that the statement is of momentous importance. It is only because we are all together in this matter that I thought that the House would be most anxious to be kept fully informed, as it is my duty to do whenever possible. After a good deal of intense bombing of Suda Bay and the various aerodromes in the neighbourhood, about 1,500 enemy troops, wearing New Zealand battle-dress, landed by gliders, parachutes and troop-carriers in the Canea-Maleme area. This message was sent at 12 o'clock to-day, when the military reported that the situation was in hand. Apparently the capture of Maleme aerodrome was the enemy's object, and this has so far failed.

I should be very loth to separate myself from the course of referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges, but I trust I may be permitted to submit to  you one or two observations upon this peculiar case, the like of which I have not seen in my experience of 42 years' actual service in this House. Are we really to understand that the Members of this new House of Commons, just elected by the people, fresh from contact with the people, are going to be frightened out of their wits by something like this? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Are they really? [Interruption.] I know hon. Members opposite do not want free speech anywhere. They will go further and further along the road to destroy it. Why should we suppose that Members of this House, many of whom enjoyed great majorities at the Election and are in close contact with their constituents, will be deterred from doing what they conscientiously believe is their public duty because——

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);245;I really cannot conceive that Members would feel deterred from giving a vote according to their duty and conscience, because some printing firm splashes a poster of an insulting character about the walls of the metropolis. Who has ever said, "You may not put up a poster of an insulting character against anybody or anything, subject, of course to the ordinary laws of life "? Who would insinuate that this House of Commons has already got into such a dither that it is afraid of the vulgar chatter and clamour which arise in the streets? It does seem to me mere panic and that we are ill conceiving our dignity if, because a firm of printers chooses to say that our names will be published if we vote this way or that in a particular Division and applies terms of abuse such as "dictators" whichever  way we vote, we suggest that the House should take action under the great procedure of Privilege. It is a formidable procedure, reserved for cases of a very special character as, for instance, if a poster were put about saying that certain Members had committed a certain crime or had certain particular advantages offered to them and which reflected upon their private honour. In that event, I quite agree there would be a breach of Privilege, but I do not see how the House can press for referring this to a Committee of Privileges when after all it is only——

I mean a threat to knock a man on the head if he votes for bread rationing, is one the House could act upon at once, but a threat to call a fellow a dictator, is really one which is not good enough. I can only say that I shall not ask any of my friends on this side of the House to oppose by a Division, the Motion referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges, because I feel that you, Mr. Speaker, having given your Ruling, the matter must take that course and I do not want to offer any divergence from your Ruling as such. At the same time, I must put on record my statement to the House that they must stand up and be men. It is very unfortunate that this newly elected House should show itself so extremely sensitive and touchy. Here is the hon. Member for Watford (Mr. J. Freeman), who was a gallant officer. Are we to believe that he feels himself deterred and intimidated from doing his duty, because he is going to be called a dictator? This is a very good example of the touchiness and timidity which have already overtaken this vast and newly returned majority—[Interruption.] I am not at all disturbed by that noise; I take the rough with the smooth. Let me make it clear as regards referring this matter to the Committee of Privileges, that we on this side do not oppose the reference, because we are sure that the sensible Committee of Privileges—and who will claim that our  Committee of Privileges is not sensible—will put this matter in its proper place, and allay the anxiety and thin skinnedness of some of our mighty populist and democratic leaders.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);12;The hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) has made the allegation——
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);54;I am raising a point of Order, Sir. The hon. Member has made the allegation that this poster, which you have ruled constitutes a prima facie case of breach of Privilege of this House, has been instigated by hon. Gentlemen on this side of the House. May I request your protection in this matter?
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);71;May I very respectfully, submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that the intervention of the hon. Member for West Fife had nothing whatever to do with the question of what is being published out of doors and what is now to be submitted to the Committee of Privileges? It is a Parliamentary offence to make an insulting charge against Members sitting opposite to you, of this character; namely, that they have instigated——
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);58;I withdraw the word "instigated" and I substitute the word "incited"; the hon. Member is welcome to the difference between them— that they have incited this printer to commit this offence. I ask that that absolutely false and, if I may avail myself of the latitude which has been given on previous occasions, I will say, lying assertion——

Gentleman did' not suggest that the death sentence upon this Jew had been respited on account of the hostages which had been taken by the Jewish terrorists. If that were so,  I should like to ask: Is it not a very serious thing to turn aside from the normal path of justice because of threats of murder by terrorists launched against hostages whom they have taken?

1941-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-12-08;Prime Minister's Declaration;189;As soon as I heard, last night, that Japan had attacked the United States, I felt it necessary that Parliament should be immediately summoned. It is indispensable to our system of government that Parliament should play its full part in all the important acts of State and at all the crucial moments of the war; and I am glad to see that so many Members have been able to be in their places, despite the shortness of the notice. With the full approval of the nation, and of the Empire, I pledged the word of Great Britain, about a month ago, that should the United States be involved in war with Japan, a British declaration of war would follow within the hour. I, therefore, spoke to President Roosevelt on the Atlantic telephone last night, with a view to arranging the timing of our respective declarations. The President told me that he would this morning send a Message to Congress, which, of course, as is well known, can alone make a declaration of war on behalf of the United States, and I then assured him that we would follow immediately.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;27;I think that the right hon. Gentleman must have made a mistake in the date. The peak date for unemployment was in the Coalition Government of 1931.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;114;It was in the Coalition Government of 1931 that reduced the unemployed from the figure of nearly three million to just above one million, and it was the right hon. Gentleman, even in these days of full employment and shortage of labour, who managed to raise unemployment to over two million at the beginning of the present year by gross mismanagement of the fuel problem. All this myth about the tragedy of unemployment between the wars—[HON. MEMBERS: "Myth?"] The myth is that  it was due to the Conservative Party, yet all the peaks and heights were reached and all the most serious causes occurred during the brief terms when the Socialists were in office.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;120;Certainly we are not defending it. I must say that the Government themselves seem to be a little more reconciled to it than they used to be, judging by the number of Socialist hereditary nobles who are being created. If they do not like the character of the brake, why do they not propose the reform of the Second Chamber? We are quite ready to confer with them and to help them in such a task. As the Socialist Government now stand, they maintain the hereditary principle. The hereditary Chamber is to have one year's suspensory veto but not two. One year's suspensory veto by a hereditary assembly is the true blue of Socialist democracy; two years is class tyranny.

1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;143;No free country of which I have heard up to the present—I quite agree that there might be some countries throughout the world—which is enjoying democratic institutions has adopted single-Chamber Government. The United States, the Swiss, the Dutch, the Belgians, the French even in their latest constitution have a Second Chamber. Eire has created its own Senate. Our Dominions, the most democratic countries in the world, all have, with the exception of Queensland I am reminded, sought and preserved two-Chamber Government—what clever people would call bi-cameral Government. All feel that between the chance vote of an election on universal sufferage and the permanent alteration of the whole slowly built structure of the State and nation there ought to be some modifying process. Show me a powerful, successful, free democratic constitution of a great sovereign state which has adopted the principle of single-Chamber Government.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;92;Norway is not a very powerful State and would not have been a State at all but for our exertions. I am speaking of the general experience of the world and I say that the overwhelming majority that I know of have a Second Chamber, mostly with lesser powers than the popular assembly and with a different outlook and function. By the way, all this insistence on Norway or Queensland by the other side of the House illustrates  and proves my point that it is single-Chamber Government which hon. Gentlemen opposite seek.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;39;The hon. Gentleman the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) is not in this matter at all. There are quite a lot of matters in which he takes an interest but this is not one of them.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;14;I do not mind in the least being interrupted. It does not worry me—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;122;I do not give way unless I think it worth while. Some of the foreign countries arrive at the two-chamber system by a proportion of members retiring every two years or every year; some by a franchise based on a higher age limit; some by the influence of local authorities standing on a different foundation; and some, like the Canadian Senate, are nominated for life and retire gradually by the effluxion of time. In some there are joint sessions where a majority decision decides in case of deadlock. I remember in 1910 we worked in the hectic interval between the two Elections of that year in conference with the Opposition but it broke down as so many other things do, on figures.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;83;I see that the Home Secretary is going to follow me. I am sorry for him, too. He always wears the air of injured innocence which we might expect to find on the face of a virtuous and respectable mayor or alderman who has been caught in a somewhat disreputable and compromising situation. I ask him: does he really think he can cling to office for 2½ years more until this Bill has passed into law under the workings of the Parliament Act?
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;220;Craft is common both to skill and deceit. No doubt it will be helpful to party discipline to be able to say to an unhappy, disillusioned party, "We must hold together until we get the Parliament Bill through and thus carry our glorious nationalisation of steel which will put the country right once and for all. Hold on." It is a powerful appeal, "Hold on, boys, for another year. Let us have a full run for our money. Let us get all out of it we can." I do not think it will happen that way. If there were a General Election tomorrow the Socialist majority would vanish. If they wait another year, they themselves will vanish for a considerable period, unwept, unhonoured, and unsung—and unhung. They have paralysed and stifled the whole native life-effort of our people. Do not let them delude themselves by supposing that they will escape on the issue of "the Peers versus the People." The electors are going to vote on their mismanagement and on their partisanship in this grave crisis in our history. Their calculations will not succeed. They will not escape, even by this partial Measure, the will of the people, and the longer they try to do so, the more decisive will be the condemnation they will receive at the national hands.

1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;51;That really does not quite do justice to Mr. Chamberlain, because the reason why he resigned was not because of any defeat in the House of Commons or that he could not gather support to continue, but because he felt that nothing short of a National Government could save the country.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;10;I strongly urged Mr. Chamberlain to continue as Prime Minister.

1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;8;That is the right hon. Gentleman's personal opinion.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;38;Everyone expresses his personal opinion, but the right hon. Gentleman, speaking for the Government, is attempting to outline their views on constitutional law, which have no foundation other than the fact that he has decided to utter them.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;141;We have had from the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) an extremely reasonable, good-tempered speech which was in marked contrast to the speech delivered earlier in the day by the Leader of the Opposition, and it was very welcome. The right hon. Gentleman said that we were discussing a matter of high constitutional importance, and we have been told by other hon. Members that this is a matter of very great constitutional importance. Yet, except during the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, the opening speeches and the intervention of the Leader of the Opposition, the general aspect of the benches in the House, and particularly the benches opposite, has been like the end of a rather dull Adjournment Debate at about half-past ten at night. Not that I expect to see the benches thronged with Members—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;89;Whenever I have been here there has been a very scanty attendance; and I have had reports from my colleagues on the Front Bench that there has been a very scanty attendance all through. I do not make a great point of it, except to say that this is not—as represented, as far as I can make out, in the point of view of hon. Members opposite—a matter of vast constitutional importance. In fact, the right hon. Gentleman ended up by saying that this was a small, niggling Bill.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;63;Well, they cannot have it both ways. The fact is, the Opposition have not made up their minds about this Bill. With characteristic impulsiveness, the Leader of the Opposition at once dashed in with a violent objects on to this Bill, and hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have been compelled to follow suit. We have been accused of drawing a red herring—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;164;It has been said that we are introducing this Bill in order to draw attention away from our alleged shortcomings. If this were so and if this were our intention, surely the obvious tactics would have been to have tried to raise a first-class row with the House of Lords on some particular issue. That was the method employed in the 1906 Parliament, known as "filling up the cup"; things were sent up to the House of Lords to get them thrown out in order to make a case in the country. But we, on the contrary, instead of waiting to have a controversy with the House of Lords, have tried to prevent any constitutional difficulty by meeting the matter before it arises. The obvious thing, if we had wanted to stage the thing for electoral ends, would have been to create a first-class row on something or other, and to have gone to the country with the cry of Lords against the Commons.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;26;Yes, but the fact is that they do not operate evenly and fairly, and never have done. They have always been against parties of the Left—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;174;I do not want to waste time, and I have already dealt with that point. Members opposite might try to attend to the argument. I have said that during the last two years we have been under the protection of the Parliament Act. When that ceases to protect us we cannot tell what might be done by another place. With all respect to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington, he does not know what the other place may do. There are 100 or so peers who attend there regularly, but the great mass are in the wilderness, and at any time may come in and overturn anything. I put it to Members opposite: supposing the position were reversed, supposing a potential majority were against them in another place, all drawn from the party on this side—and, let me say, not from the most intelligent followers of this party. Would they like the position that at any moment the whole of their programme might be upset? Of course, they would not.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;31;The hon. and gallant Member really has not done himself justice. There is not a majority for the Conservative Party in the country, but there is a majority in the Lords.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;120;There is not much point in that interjection. I am trying to deal with the point put by the right hon. Gentleman. I say—and this is the doctrine of my party—that there is in 1he other Chamber no distinct voice of the people that can over-rule the opinions expressed by the elected representatives sent here. If we want a revising Chamber at all, it may have a period of delay for revising, for looking at details, and may be very useful, but the first thing about a Second Chamber is that it should not have comparable powers with the lower House. I do not know if any suggestion has been put forward from the other side with regard to that.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;32;I generally give way, but I am interrupted so often that I find I do not have time to say what I want to say. I should like to ask the Opposition—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;160;Hon. Members opposite have accused us of embarking on partisanship. I want to ask whether the opposition to this Bill is really based on some constitutional principle or whether it is only based on the fact that it is convenient for them to have greater power for their party in the House of Lords? Not one single argument has been put forward to suggest that it is essential that there should be two years' delay when the Conservative Party are in power. We had very strong objections in this House to Mr. Chamberlain's Government. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford was in opposition, as were many other Members, who were gravely disturbed in their minds, but they were under the iron hand of Captain Margesson. They never got any helping hand  from the House of Lords, and under this theory that the House of Lords are in close touch with the people, they might surely have taken action.

I rely upon those statements, and when I read them over again last night in preparation for this Debate I found it very difficult to improve upon them or alter them in any way. This may accuse me of infertility of mind, but it also gives me some confidence that I have not misled the House or felt myself stultified, in all respects at any rate, by the harsh and unforeseeable movement of events It is not often that one wishes to repeat what one said two months ago, and still less 10 months ago, but I propose to do so, because in no other way and in no other words that I can think of can I remind the House of and bring home to them the grim, bare bones of the Polish problem.

The proposal of the Australian Government was that they should have a representative at the War Cabinet who should have the right to be heard in the formulation and direction of policy. I replied that we were in agreement with this proposal, and for a good many months past Sir Earle Page has been exercising these rights. We have informed the Governments of Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa that the same facilities are available for them if they wish to take advantage of them. We have as yet had no formal reply from New Zealand. I understand that Canada and South Africa are satisfied with the existing arrangements for consultation—indeed they expressed themselves strongly an this point—and do not at present wish to attach special representatives to the War Cabinet here.

The charge on the Consolidated Fund fixed by the Civil List Act of 1937 has remained unchanged, but the increase in the cost of wages, goods and services provided from the Civil List has resulted in deficits in recent years, causing heavy demands upon His Majesty's Privy Purse, which have been met by His Majesty from savings accumulated during the war. These savings are now exhausted and His Majesty's Government have decided as from 1st April, 1951, to relieve the Civil List of the cost of certain services.

A notable feature of the meeting to which  my hon. Friend has drawn attention, was the presence of members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives of the United States of America.

1945-8-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-8-24;Lend-Lease Contracts (Cancellation);222;The very grave and disquieting statement which the Prime Minister has just made to us must overshadow our minds. I agree with him entirely that a Debate of a discursive character arising before these issues have been properly weighed by the House might easily be detrimental to our national interest, which always must claim the allegiance of Members wherever they sit, and I think I can give my assurance on behalf of the hon. Gentlemen who are associated with me on this side of the House that we shall not touch upon this matter in the forthcoming Debate on the Adjournment. Words or phrases might be used which would hamper the task of our negotiators in the difficult matters which lie before them. I think the utmost restraint should be practised, not only in the House, but, if I may say so, also out of doors, in all comments on the American situation at the present time. I cannot believe that it is the last word of the United States; I cannot believe that so great a nation whose  Lend-Lease policy was characterised by me as "the most unsordid act in the history of the world," would proceed in a rough and harsh manner to hamper a faithful Ally, the Ally who held the fort while their own American armaments were preparing.

I just want to get the facts correct. His question was not an exact repetition of what had been put before. I am not denying, in the least, anything I said then, and I shall have something more to say about it. I want to point out that on the first two occasions to which I have referred conditions were very different from what they are to-day. At neither of those times was war imminent, and I think I may fairly say that there was no question present in the mind of anybody at that time which appeared then likely to lead to war.
1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;55;The hon. Member is perfectly correct. I am referring to the two previous ones. On those occasions the Czecho-Slovak question had not emerged into a prominent position. Although it is true that various countries, including our own, were rearming, yet the rearmament did not reach either the dimensions or the pace which characterises it to-day.

1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;160;I was a little disappointed with the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair) and the attitude he has felt it his duty to adopt. We have been in very general agreement upon the great steps which have been taken in foreign policy, and I was rather hoping that he would find in this Debate an opportunity for carrying the excellent leadership he has shown in these matters of foreign affairs one step further in the sphere of defence, because certainly no one has been a more strenuous advocate of the enlargement of our responsibilities and of the vigorous championship of our rights and interests than my right hon. Friend, and it is somewhat discouraging to find that at the first really awkward fence, if I may put it in that way, with which he has been confronted, he has found it necessary to take such a very strong attitude of opposition.
1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;202;They were able to do so. But there is a difference now. Then the cause was explained and the nation accepted the explanation and rallied to the cause. But now the impulse, the main impulse, to resist the Nazi dictatorship principles comes from the mass of the people. I think in every country with which we are associated, in all those European countries—countries trembling on the verge, like Yugoslavia—the drive of the people is strong. It is very often the Governments who are hesitating. Here the spirit of the people has been ahead of the  Government, and it may even be found to be ahead of Parliament also. There is still time for the countries which are ruled by the dictators to place themselves in harmony with the overwhelming majority of the human race and in harmony with its irresistible forward movement. That must be our hope, and I earnestly hope, although conscientious differences must be expressed, that everything will be done to avoid giving encouragement at this juncture to these dictators, or that they may be led to suppose that we are not ready, with other like-minded States, to go to all lengths in doing our share of the common duty.
1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;77;The hon. and gallant Member misunderstood my argument. My point is that the obligations which we had already would mean a great military effort, and that if war broke out there would be a call upon all our resources. The fact that we had accepted an additional obligation here and an additional obligation there did not necessarily mean an intensification of that effort, because if the worst came to the worst we should need all our strength.

Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) has not got it right. There is no question of legislation on the commercial agreement. The commercial agreement is a point which is going to be discussed at an international conference, and the matter is intimately bound up  with other matters. All that is suggested is, not a unilateral abandonment of preferences, but discussions for a general reduction of trade barriers in which the reduction of preferences might form a part. No legislation is required on that.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Anglo-American Economic And Financial Agreement;26;I have already replied to that point. Our practice in this House is that the Government should take responsibility for the Measures which they bring forward.

1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;320;When I spoke on Thursday last, I stated that I could give only an incomplete account of the operations, and that a further statement would be made this week, when I hoped to be able to give a fuller story. I also intimated that I was obliged to impose a certain reticence upon myself, in order to avoid saying anything which might involve risk to our troops. Since then, no doubt, hon. Members have realised that, while at that time it was known that our Forces had been withdrawn from Andalsnes, we still had to withdraw troops from Namsos, and I was extremely anxious not to give any hint of an operation that was bound to be even more dangerous than the withdrawal from Andalsnes, both on account of the larger number of men to be taken off and of the fact that it would be possible for the Germans to bring there the whole available force of their bombers. Now, I am able once again to pay my tribute to  the very remarkable skill of our naval and military Forces, who managed to effect this withdrawal, in the course of one single short night, without suffering any loss in the operation. The danger which they were running is illustrated by the fact that early on the following morning the Germans discovered that the troops were returning in their ships, and they sent a force of some 50 bombers to attack them. Considering that this convoy was outside the range of our fighters and that it had to depend, therefore, solely upon the anti-aircraft fire of the ships, I think we may count ourselves fortunate that we did not lose more than one British and one French destroyer—His Majesty's Ship "Afridi" and the French ship "Bison." By this time the men from Namsos and those from Andalsnes are back again, and the campaign in Southern Norway is at an end.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;67;Well it was not expected that it would be necessary, but I see that it is stated that Ministers were to blame for that. Ministers, of course, must be expected to be blamed for everything. [Hon. Members: "They missed the bus."] There were reports emanating from Stockholm—maybe invented by the enemy—which roused expectations which were never justified, and which were certainly never endorsed by any Ministers. [Interruption.]
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;180;We did our best to damp down these unfounded reports. Of course, we had to be careful not to say anything which would inform the enemy of the true situation, and I am afraid that in the circumstances the shock and the disappointment were inevitable. I will try to examine the history and the causes of this failure, and I will try to answer some questions. I do not wish to extenuate anything, but at the same time I hope that we shall not exaggerate the extent or the importance of the check which we have received. The withdrawal from Southern Norway is not comparable to the withdrawal from Gallipoli. There were no large forces involved. The fact was, it was not much more than a single division, and our losses, therefore, were not really great in number, nor was there any considerable or valuable amount of stores left behind. It must be remembered, as I have already pointed out, that if we had losses, the Germans had far heavier losses in warships, in planes, in transport and in men.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;27;Does the hon. Member want the date and the hour? If so, he had better put a Question down. It is not very long ago—since 11th April.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;89;Yes, Sir. My right hon. Friend feels that that would be the best arrangement, and I am inclined to think that the important work at the Admiralty should remain in his hands if it is possible, but I am relying upon him to let me know if he finds that the new tasks which have been imposed upon him make it difficult for him to fulfil them and the work at the Admiralty as well. Then, of course, in such a case I shall take steps to relieve him
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;300;I appreciate the point. No, it was not before the Norwegian operations; it has only been made recently and did not arise out of the Norwegian operations, because the change would have been made in any case. For the purposes I have mentioned my right hon. Friend has been provided with a small personal staff under a distinguished staff officer, Major-General Ismay, and General Ismay has been appointed an additional member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. I have no doubt other changes in the form of Government or the functions of individual members of it may from time to time suggest themselves as desirable. I think it is very likely that changes of that kind in war-time are almost bound to take place. As far as I am concerned, I shall endeavour to keep my mind open to any fresh considerations and to take any steps which may seem to be called for if they will help the country. Once again I want to urge hon. Members that in these strenuous days we should do better to occupy ourselves with increasing our war effort rather than disputing about the form of Government. It is in the production of materials, the production of planes, the production of tanks  and guns, and munitions, and all the countless articles of equipment which are required to fit out our weapons and make them useful; it is in the production of these things that we want organisation, energy and good will. As far as we in the Government are concerned, we are doing all we can to overtake the start which Germany has obtained during her long years of preparation. We are getting to-day the wholehearted co-operation of employers and workers; we want also to get the co-operation of hon. Members of all parties.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;92;The co-operation of Members of all parties, if not the co-operation of all Members of all parties, in a work which everyone recognises to be the prime need to-day. We do not set ourselves up as being infallible, as being above receiving help from others who are willing to help. Let us then before these trials come upon us put all our strength into the work of preparing for them, and we shall thus steadily increase our strength until we ourselves are able to deliver our blows where and when we will.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;220;It was represented, not that this would be a matter of hit and then go away again, but that here was a chance of the campaign opening up. It is no good hon. Members quarrelling with my statement; that view was taken. Therefore, there is widespread disappointment at this setback. It is said that in this war hitherto there has never been any initiative from our side, and it is said also that there is no real planning in anticipation of the possible strokes that will be taken against us. I think we must examine this affair from that aspect. If we look back, we find that the Government had the idea of blocking with mines the route to Narvik. I do not intend to discuss whether that was or was not a good idea, but if that was to be done, it must have been apparent to those who intended to do it that there was the very greatest possibility of a hit back by Germany. The first question I want to put is, what provision was made for that contingency? The Prime Minister said that Germany had planned this expedition with very great care over a long period. I want to know what care was exercised in planning the means for defeating that stroke if it should come.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;9;I said that they would take a heavy toll.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;126;I quite agree that the right hon. Gentleman said they would not do it with impunity but I think he gave us encouragement. After all, in considering the inception of this expedition that is one of the vital factors—how far we could prevent those reinforcements being made.  One has to recognise, also, that an unknown quantity was the extent of the defence which the Norwegians could put up. But the gravamen of my attack on the Government is that it does not seem that there was a thinking-out of our plans beforehand, that there was not adequate Intelligence, that there was not the necessary concentration on the essential objective and I ask whether, at any time, there was not delay and discussion where action was necessary?
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;79;I think the right hon. Gentleman misunderstood me. I did not say that he was to be chairman of the Chiefs of Staff. I said he was to give guidance and direction to them. That does not mean that he will necessarily attend at every meeting of the Chiefs of Staff. The right hon. Gentleman will notice that he has an officer who is attached to him and who is an official member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;254;The point is that the right hon. Gentleman is now to be given a rather exceptional position as being the member of the War Cabinet who is more particularly concerned with major strategy. It is against all good rules of organisation that a man who is in charge of major strategy should also be in command of a particular unit. It is like having a man commanding an army in  the field and also commanding a division. He has a divided interest between the wider questions of strategy and the problems affecting his own immediate command. The First Lord of the Admiralty has great abilities, but it is not fair to him that he should be put into an impossible position like that. Our friends have been disheartened. We have had a reverse, but we have had reverses before and no one of us is in the slightest degree shaken in his faith that we are going to win this war. When we have reverses, the essential thing is that we should learn from them and should not repeat our mistakes. I have no doubt whatever in the courage and constancy of all the people of this country, provided they get the right lead, but the Government will be blind and deaf, if they do not realise that there is widespread anxiety among the people of this country—people of all views and of all kinds of thought. They are not satisfied that the war is being waged with sufficient energy, intensity, drive and resolution.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;17;The point was that they had to join us and then there could be an effective defence.

Gentleman asks what was the use of keeping the force if we had not the ships. We had ships in which troops could be conveyed, but they were warships and not merchant ships.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;19;I did not say that. It is a mistake to assume that no troopships were used on any occasion.

1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;29;I understood that troops were being specially kept for this expedition, and my point was that they should  not have included troops who had had only two months' training.

1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;53;My point was that the Government, having all these men assembled and ready within a very short time of taking a decision which might lead to the need for employing them and their equipment, dispersed them straight away and then came to a decision to take a risk for which they were needed.

I cannot refer to it without saying that there is nothing personal about the Chairman of the Committee; it is a constitutional issue which is involved, and which we think ought to be cleared out of the way. The longer it remains in its present indeterminate position, the more danger there is of people in the country reading these words and using them perhaps with an undue freedom.

1947-4-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-4-16;Privilege (Newspaper Article);91;I always understood, Mr. Speaker, that on your giving a Ruling that there is a prima facie case the Leader of the House moved that the matter should be referred to the Committee of Privileges. If, however, a Private Member can do it, that is quite agreeable to us. At the same time I think it should be seconded—[Horn. MEMBERS: "It has been"]—Are we then to understand that His Majesty's Government have no views on this matter? I think it is important that His Majesty's Government should be associated with it.

1946-5-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1946-5-24;Egypt (Treaty Negotiations);269;I am rather surprised at the line the right hon. Gentleman takes on this matter. A statement was made with regard to Government policy. There was a Debate, in which I took part and in which the Lord President took part. The right hon. Gentleman then asked for further time for discussion, and accordingly it was arranged that we should have this Debate. It occurs on a Friday, which is a Supply Day. I have been present at a great many Debates on Supply Days, and I am certainly not prepared to say that it is without precedent for a Minister not to rise immediately after the first speaker. Over and over again there have been full Debates with a winding-up speech from the Minister when he has heard the whole of what the House has to say. When it is a question of a Supply Day on which a Minister deals with a range of supply, it is quite natural that he should open, but when a Supply Day is specifically asked for by the Opposition in order that they may put their point of view and give the Committee an opportunity of putting its point of view, it is a perfectly reasonable thing—there is plenty of precedent for it—for the Minister who is under criticism to wait until he has heard the criticisms before he replies. Therefore, I say that there is nothing whatever unusual in this, and I think my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is fully entitled to hear what is to be said in order that he can reply to the whole Debate.

I will give him complete acquittal on that. He may leave the dock without a stain upon his character. This alternative of Palestine, which the Government may be cherishing, in order to protect the Canal, is disastrous to us and unduly complicating to all the other policies they were hopefully pursuing.

I suppose that the House will wish, on some convenient occasion, to debate the general position of our foreign affairs, but we on this side of the House should be very ready to consult the Government's convenience in the matter as to whether it should be next week or the week after. I would suggest, if it were agreeable, that discussions should proceed through the usual channels with a view to determining what time would be most in accordance with convenience and the public interest for the discussion on this matter to be resumed.

His Majesty has never spared himself in his unswerving devotion to the heavy and onerous duties of his high office. The twelve years of his reign have been years of strain and anxiety, and His Majesty's steadfast bearing under all the trials of war and peace has done much to keep his people in good heart and courage.

On behalf of the Conservative Party, I wish to say that we associate ourselves fully with the spirit and the words of the statement he has just made to us. We share to the full the deep regret which he has expressed at the news this morning's newspapers contained. We share also the inevitable disappointment which will be felt in Australia and in New Zealand, but we are quite sure that there is only one paramount duty immediately incumbent upon His Majesty's Ministers, and that is to advise the King to rest and give himself, in the prime of life as he is, every possible chance of recovering his full strength.
1952-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-11-25;Kenya (Situation);109;May I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that while we must guard against abuse of the use of this Standing Order, it is essential that its use should be guarded in proper cases. I find it a little difficult to understand why, because there is a continuing series of events, if some particular event comes into prominence it should not be raised. If that is so, it seems to me that at any time when there were disturbances in the Colonies, Ireland, or anywhere else—or even an industrial dispute like that at Tonypandy—one would be precluded from raising one particular issue because of the continuance of the trouble.
1952-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-11-25;Kenya (Situation);52;Further to that point of order. Is it not within your recollection, Mr. Speaker, that on a number of occasions when this question has been put forward it has always been possible to submit reasons to Mr. Speaker for his consideration without in any way suggesting that we are controverting his Ruling?
1952-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-11-25;Kenya (Situation);106;Might I suggest that it would be better for a debate to be arranged through the usual channels instead of on a precise, specific mattes  of this kind? The usual channels can be a medium for arriving at an occasion when a debate on the whole situation in Kenya can take place and—though this is hardly relevant and I ask the indulgence of the House—is it not really dangerous at this critical moment to do anything which weakens the confidence of the handful of Europeans in the discharge of their duty, upon which the prevention, perhaps, of the massacre of large numbers of white people depends?
1954-1-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-1-09;United States Air Force (United Kingdom Bases);144;As I have previously informed the House, the arrangement for United States Air Force use of bases in this country will continue so long as it is needed in the general interest of world peace and security. The British contribution this year to maintenance costs will be £17,500. Apart from this sum, the maintenance of the bases will be entirely a charge on United States funds. As regards the construction of the bases, this country's direct financial contribution is limited to £22½ million out of an estimated total expenditure of £125 million  spread over the years 1951 to 1955. The question of criminal jurisdiction over United States Service personnel will be dealt with by the Visiting Forces Act when it comes into force. In making our Civil Defence dispositions, we will naturally give special attention to places that are specially liable to atomic attack.

But the general policy of the late Government in rearming in conjunction with the United States and in making strong defence arrangements has played a noticeable and traceable part in the relaxation and diminution of tension which has occurred. I think that they deserve full credit for their action, in which we supported them, and which is being continued subject to the general tendency of events.

Members for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) and Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) about the work and composition of the Swinton Committee, to make a few general observations on the subject. I submitted to the House some time ago the view that it was not in the public interest that Questions should be asked and answered about this Committee or other branches of Secret Service work, or about measures to deal with Fifth Column activities. It would be very wrong for a Government to plead the public interest as a reason for avoiding public and Parliamentary criticism and debate, and, personally, I would never do so. I am always anxious to give the House of Commons the utmost possible information, and to welcome debate. Therefore when I said it was not in the public interest that this matter should be  pursued, I hoped that this would have been accepted by all Members of the House. However, I regret to say that a number of Questions have been put on the Paper day after day, quite disregarding the request which the Government made. It would have been possible for the Government, under the powers now accorded, to prevent these Questions from appearing on the Paper, and to prevent all reference to the subject in the newspapers; but I thought it would be much better to leave the putting down of Questions to the good will and sense of responsibility of Members, and I am very sorry that in a few cases this attitude has not been forthcoming.

But I think that if we are to have the Government cross-questioned about this committee and Secret Service work, and one point after another is brought out, and Members say, "Why did you not tell us that before?" that is a process which would be vitiating the measures of secrecy taken by the Government in this matter, and a right which is claimed by every other Government.

No details are yet available except those contained in the Japanese official communique, which claims that both ships were sunk by air attack.

In the circumstances, I make no reproach, for if I had been in the same position as hon. Members not sitting on this Bench and not in possession of all the information which we have, I should very likely have felt the same. The statement which I have to make this morning will show that there were no grounds for doubt. We were in consultation all day yesterday with the French Government and we felt that the intensified action which the Germans were taking against Poland allowed no delay in making our own position clear. Accordingly, we decided to send to our Ambassador in Berlin instructions which he was to hand at nine o'clock this morning to the German Foreign Secretary and which read as follows:

All have  been ill-starred, but all have been faithful and sincere. This is of the highest moral value—and not only moral value, but practical value—at the present time, because the wholehearted concurrence of scores of millions of men and women, whose co-operation is indispensable and whose comradeship and brotherhood are indispensable, is the only foundation upon which the trial and tribulation of modern war can be endured and surmounted. This moral conviction alone affords that ever-fresh resilience which renews the strength and energy of people in long, doubtful and dark days. Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed with the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts this Sunday morning there is peace. Our hands may be active, but our consciences are at rest.

1946-10-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-10-17;Written Answers To Questions;27;Are we to have a discussion, at any time, on adding a quarter-of-an-hour to Question time for oral Questions? Is anything in prospect with regard to that?
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);223;There are seven Questions on the Order Paper on this subject, to which I can make only one answer. I do not consider that this matter can be dealt with satisfactorily by a number of separate answers at Question Time. On the other hand, I must advise the House most seriously that a Debate on this matter would have very great dangers. One tale is good till another is told. His Majesty's Government take great trouble over their conduct of business, and on the whole it may be said that it has been conducted with success. When you look at the advance in Italy and the extraordinary achievements of the cross-Channel landing in France, a fair-minded man would consider that the Administration had a right to the confidence of the House when they said they did not wish a particular subject discussed. This is not because we are not prepared to discuss it in all detail, and if need be in all severity; but the result of such a discussion might well be to emphasise any differences which exist with the French Committee of National Liberation, headed by General de Gaulle. I should be sorry to see these issues prematurely forced to a decision, and, therefore, I ask from the House a measure of leniency and forbearance in their treatment of this matter.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);22;I said that I did not think it would be advisable to answer a number of questions. I remain of that opinion.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);45;We are going into the very thing I said I would like to avoid, namely, a Debate. I have no reason to fear a Debate on the subject, except that I think it would be necessary to put a case which would cause widespread pain.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);223;In this last week of great success, I should think as large a proportion of our time was given to the discussions about General de Gaulle and his affairs and his Committee as to any other subject. I can assure the House that it is not that these matters are not engaging the attention of His Majesty's Government. They are very much indeed. But I am reluctant to bring them to a head at present, and I hope that a better solution will be achieved than would be the case, if there had to be a quite definite threshing out of the matter in the House of Commons. With regard to the financial point, it is rather technical. The President made a statement last night, which is published, I believe, in this morning's papers, but I have not had a chance of reading that statement. I could not commit myself to anything about finance—a statement about which might well be made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer—until we know what it is that the President has said on the subject. It seems to me, however, quite clear that if notes are given out to the French population, in return for livestock and other services, the responsibility for meeting them, in the first instance at any rate, would lie with the Governments issuing them.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);165;I am afraid the hon. Gentleman's question was so long that I have forgotten what was the point of it. I am quite certain that there has been no breach of the financial regulations and rules and practices of the House. In regard to any issue of chits or notes, in foreign countries, that is all covered by the general conditions of the expenditure on the war, and all has to be accounted for to the House in the proper method and at the proper time. As for the general question of whether there is entire agreement throughout the country and in the House, on all the ways in which the different foreign policies, as affecting all the various countries, have been handled, I can assure the House that I have never aimed at so high an ideal, and, when I think of some of the persons who would have to be converted, I am very glad that I never set my aim so high.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);139;I never intended it to be indefinite postponement, but I do not think it would be a good thing to have a Debate in the House now. I am certain it would do more harm that good, and might lead to things being said which afterwards were found to have very serious repercussions, because, if attacks are made, answers will be given, whenever required. Therefore, I still adhere to my request to the House, and my advice to the House—it can only be advice; I am entirely in their hands—that they will not raise this matter at this time. But I assure the House it is my earnest desire to give them the fullest account of all these matters, when that can be done without prejudice to such hopes as remain, in respect of such matters in the future.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);162;I do not at all agree that there is great and widespread anxiety. It certainly deserves careful and unremitting attention, but I think that, if there is great and widespread anxiety in this matter, it will be, and should be, properly directed to our gallant soldiers who are striking down the enemy in France and advancing continually, and to the great operations which are in progress, and which give hope as well as anxiety. It seems to me very lacking in proportion for hon. Members—Would the hon. Member like to say something more? If he does not wish to do so, perhaps he will allow me to finish what I have to say. I say, I think it shows a marked sense of disproportion and I am earnestly  hoping that we shall not be pressed at this time. If I had no hopes of a better solution than I could announce at the present time, I would not0 ask for the delay.

The Russians opened an offensive in January, as Marshal Stalin had said in his message they would, and I am arranging for the further message on this subject which I sent to Marshal Stalin on 16th January, not hitherto published, to be circulated in the OFFICIAL REPORT.

1943-9-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-9-22;Death Of Sir Kingsley Wood;387;I revert to the painful event which was made known yesterday, namely, the sudden death of our Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood. He was a very old Member of the House. He had been here for a quarter of a century. For the last ten years he has been continuously in office amid all the vicissitudes, changes and shocks of that period. Everyone knows how good his work was at the Post Office and the Ministry of Health. He left a mark on the Post Office and made a very great contribution to building up the prestige of the Ministry of Health to the high point it has attained among the great offices of State. Then, before the war, he was taken to a field in which he had not had previous experience. It was thought necessary that his business and administrative efficiency should be applied to our air production and to our Royal Air Force, and he became Air Minister in those critical years. As between the different Services, while avoiding invidious comparisons, I should certainly say that the outlook of the Royal Air Force upon this war was more closely attuned to the circumstances and conditions as they emerged by painful experience than those of either of the other two Services. The great contribution for which Sir Kingsley Wood's  administration of the Air Ministry will always be remembered was the founding and development of the Empire Air Training Scheme in Canada, to which pilots from New Zealand and Australia came in great numbers, to which would-be pilots from the United Kingdom have also been sent in large numbers, and which has produced us a ceaseless flow, numbered by tens of thousands, of those extraordinarily competent and daring men to whom we owe so much of the satisfactory position we have now attained. This Empire Air Training Scheme was a work of great imagination, and all who were concerned in it deserve the greatest possible credit. It was not only a war winner but an Empire cementer. I imagine that the friendships and comradeships formed by these young men in the vast training camps of Canada will carry on their beneficent influence long after the older Members of this House have passed away. That was a very great and outstanding act of his administration.

As indicated, however, in my reply of 15th November, to the hon.

I think it is all to the good that, in the midst of present world affairs, this House should devote a day to the affairs of a small tribe in Africa, and concern itself with the rights of individual citizens. This is a non-party matter and it is a very difficult problem, on which opinions may well differ yet be opinions sincerely held.

This is not a matter in which it has been suggested that there should be a total exile, but, because of the controversies in the tribe, the conclusion was reached that the leading personality should be excluded for a period of years.

By agreement between the three Governments, the nature of these war-time arrangements has not been revealed on grounds of public policy. The position of the United States Administration in many of these matters is now regulated by legislation enacted in the United States since the end of the war, and the war-time arrangements have been modified accordingly.

It certainly would be a very great convenience, and would, I believe, be welcomed by the public, if an electrical record of major statements about the war could be made. This record could be used for subsequent broadcasting, which might be deemed an advantage. In my own case I have been constantly asked to repeat the speech I have delivered in the House over the broadcast later. This  imposes a very heavy strain, and is, moreover, unsatisfactory from the point of view of delivery.
1942-1-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-1-20;House Of Commons Speeches (Electrical Recording);127;The idea is that a record should be made for subsequent use. This would be convenient because of the great difference in time between this country and the United States, Australasia, India, South Africa and so forth. I also have the feeling that in the circumstances of this war, when matters have to be spoken of which intimately affect so many of our Dominions and Allies, there might be advantages in taking this course. But I am entirely in the hands of the House. If they do not feel they can give me this easement on this occasion as an experiment, I shall not take it amiss in any way, and I will do my best over the broadcast that evening to repeat what I have said.

I think the House is quite as competent as any particular group of individuals to consider this matter. I dealt myself very carefully with the question of the records. It would be a matter for decision by the House, under Mr. Speaker's guidance, as to whether anything should be left out or should not be reproduced—for instance, if anything was said which revealed a military secret. This is now removed from the published records, and similar latitude would be provided for in this case. I do not propose to adopt the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion.

1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 24—(Rates Of Profits Tax, Etc);135;I should like to pay my tribute, not for the first time, to the careful, patient and conciliatory manner in which the right hon. Gentleman the Home Secretary discharges his duties as Leader of the House. We all appreciate his good feeling and his desire to have everything go through as smoothly as possible—to the advantage of the Government. Also, we are always a little bit influenced by the agreeable nature of his personality. I was sorry that he marred the somewhat serious arguments which he laid forward—and which I shall refer to in a minute—by referring to matters which apparently concern not the House but the turf. We all know the right hon. Gentleman's addiction to that pursuit, and this momentary lapse will, I am sure, be pardoned on both sides of the Committee.
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 24—(Rates Of Profits Tax, Etc);53;We are now only at Clause 24. The right hon. Gentleman proposes we should deal with Clauses 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31. I must say it seems to me an abuse of the overwhelming majority which he possesses, and I trust will be resisted by every means in our power.

1947-2-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-18;New Factories;31;Why could not the 60 pages containing information of new factories be published once, and then merely additions published weekly after that? What have the Government to hide in this matter?
1947-2-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-18;New Factories;25;May I suggest that the hon. Gentleman should jettison some of this exceptional modesty, and let us have the simple facts for which we ask?

Because a Minister has failed in his duty to be in attendance on the House for the  answering of a particular Question, is that any reason why he should have the privilege of giving that answer after the end of Question time on another day?
1951-6-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-28;Mountview Telephoneexchange;47;This was represented to us as the answer to a Question, but, Sir, of course, if the hon.

Gentleman was present when previous Questions were put to the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and he said that the Prime Minister would answer those Questions also, in addition to Questions Nos. 48 and 49.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;19;I would be delighted to answer any question that comes to me in the ordinary course of Parliamentary business.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;84;I should have notice of questions like that, which raise considerable issues. We are in close touch with the United States on these matters. We have a most sincere desire, which is shared in all parts of the House, to see this obstacle of the prisoners' forcible repatriation removed. That is a matter of honour, but we earnestly hope that it may be overcome. It certainly is very near to being overcome and I think we may hopefully await the further development of events.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;112;I think that the matters of principle have been settled. It is now a question of method. I really do not see why there should not be an  agreement on this and why we should not move forward pretty quickly to larger topics and aspects in Korea. But it does not rest entirely with our side, as it were, in this war that is taking place in Korea. I am sure of this—that if agreement on method cannot be reached now it is not because of any difficulties arising out of the specific issues, but because of extraneous considerations which may be in the minds of those with whom we are arguing.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;48;I am sure that we would have a much better chance of getting a satisfactory solution under the conduct of General Harrison, who has been acting in accordance with instructions he received from higher authority, than we should have even if the hon.

Member, on reflection, will perhaps agree that when the position has been established for so long a period as 40 years, one should not go out of one's way to take the initiative in making a change in the situation.
1951-11-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-11-22;South Africa (British Protectorates);21;I am afraid that I cannot distinguish without some careful thought between the implication of the difference between created and engendered.
1949-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-18;Transjordan (British Forces);90;We are content on this side of the House that the Debate should take place next week. May I ask, however, whether we can have an assurance from the Foreign Secretary that, in the interval, having gone to Aqaba, we do not scuttle from it under any threat of mere violence? We would like to have that assurance. May I also ask if the Foreign Secretary will consider whether a British representative to the de facto Government of Israel is not greatly needed to be sent at the present time?

1947-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-04;Blocked Sterling Balances (Negotiations);55;Is it not a fact that the Governor-General of India was notified in the time of the late Government that Great Britain reserved her full rights to present a counter-claim on account of the effective defence of India by all means—land, sea, air and diplomacy—by which the freedom of India from foreign invasion was secured?
1947-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-04;Blocked Sterling Balances (Negotiations);42;Is that point going to be made? How do we accept the great concessions made on Lend-Lease by the United States and yet divert a large portion of our remaining assets to-payment of an exactly similar war debt to the Indian Government?
1942-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-6-30;Malaya And Singapore (Information);28;The various papers received from General Wavell as the result of the collection of material which he was directed to make are not suitable for publication in wartime.
1942-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-6-30;Malaya And Singapore (Information);56;I certainly never contemplated being committed to the publication of these documents, which were collected for the instruction and further information of the military authorities, and whether they should be made public  or not could only be decided after they had been seen. It clearly would cause a great deal of ill-will throughout the British Empire.
1942-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-6-30;Malaya And Singapore (Information);38;I have addressed myself to the Question on the Paper, and to some extent that answers the Supplementary Question of the hon.

1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;38;The right hon. Gentleman could surely find other things in life to laugh at besides those which do not include himself. Otherwise life might be rather gloomy for him. I was saying—a fanatical intelligentsia obsessed by economic fallacies.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;43;The hon. Member may set himself up as a judge, but I must ask him to take his place in the general assembly of the House and not to assume that his will be the casting vote upon a decision of such moment.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;57;We must also preserve our sense of proportion. It seems difficult to believe that the activities of the small number of Communists in our midst could at the present time inflict upon our defensive effort, or upon our national unity, anything like the injury that will be done to us all by this Act of party sabotage.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;100;We shall, if we should obtain the responsibility and the power in any future which is possible to foresee, repeal the existing Iron and Steel Act,  irrespective of whether the vesting date has occurred or not. We shall then proceed to revive the solution which has been set forth in the Trades Union Congress Report and which is accepted by the Iron and Steel Federation, and we shall set up again the tripartite Board, which has been proved to have worked so well. This would be the policy if we had the power, either before or after another General Election.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;8;I do not withdraw a word of it.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;25;The right hon. Gentleman's argument seems to have great difficulty, no doubt not through any fault of his own, in distinguishing between truth and falsehood.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;66;I really did not suggest at all that this document abandoned the principle and the aim of nationalisation. On the contrary, if my memory serves me, I read a passage which showed that that was not so. Why I quoted the document was to show the very large measure of agreement which existed in regard to the control of a particular industry through a statutory board.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;5;I did not say that.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;48;Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me to express a hope that he will, before he sits down, return for a few moments to the actual subject of the Motion before the House, and tear himself away from these intriguing electoral calculations in which his soul is buried?
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;8;I have stated what would be our policy.

1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;31;I consider that a Government which has not got a majority behind its Parliamentary representation should feel itself considerably limited and restricted in its right to make far-reaching changes of policy.

1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);1;Rubbish.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);3;Failure of administration.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);44;We have had a very interesting Debate. I must say that I preferred the more measured words of the right hon. Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. R. A. Butler) to the rather portentous opening of the  right hon. Member for Bromley (Mr. H. Macmillan).
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);89;I did not think that the content of his speech was quite equal to the manner. This Debate has taken a rather unexpected line. As I understood it, the Debate was to be concerned solely with the incident on the Yangtse. It has tended to turn into rather a desultory Debate on foreign affairs, and it would really have been more appropriate to have someone who had been prepared for making a speech on foreign affairs to answer the last part of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);252;The answer was on the question of Hong Kong, and that has been dealt with. I say it is no wonder that this matter was not pursued, because, when we have met any senior officers, they have always said that this idea is complete nonsense. As a matter of fact, a broadside in "The Times" by a gallant admiral, who was a well-liked Member of this House in the last Parliament, has completely silenced the batteries opposite, and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Crawley) also made that point. The point about air cover, the idea that somehow or other we were going to have an operation of war for the silencing of batteries with aircraft of various sizes, either land-based or from aircraft carriers, up 220 miles of river, has proved to be absolute moonshine. I think it was quite wise of the right hon. Member for Bromley that he turned away from that and dealt with why it was a wise thing or a foolish thing that the "Amethyst" should have gone to Nan king at all. [An HON. MEMBER: "It did not get there."] I said, why it should go there. It is a very elementary point. The point of the right hon. Gentleman was that it ought not to have started to go there. Surely the point just made by an hon. Member is a very simple point; and is it really worth while in a serious Debate to make a childish little point like that?
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);13;I am coming to that. I think the hon. Member is a lawyer.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);24;Then it is no use appealing to him to develop a case in an orderly way. Perhaps he will wait for the next round.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);93;I think it is quite true that she could have remained a greater time. The question was, how long? It was thought wise to take the opportunity, which seemed to be an opportunity, of relieving her, otherwise she might have been tied up a much longer time. It was a matter of judgment. It was not decided, as the right hon. Gentleman can imagine, by a Cabinet decision, or anything of that sort. It was the view taken there. I have no doubt that it is a view as good as anybody's here.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);182;Yes; 7th March, and down on 10th March; and the "Consort" went upon 8th March. The "Cossack" came down on 14th March, and the American vessel towards the end of March. The truce all this time, as I have pointed out, was uncertain. I do not think—and I think everybody there will not agree with the senior Burgess for Oxford University (Sir A. Salter)—that this was a deliberate action. I think it was shown it was not, because the first firing was stopped when they saw what she was. Then it started again. I have no doubt the right hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there was a large number of troops possibly not very well disciplined, and I do not think this was a concerted act at all. There was a danger that it might happen. It equally might have happened when the other vessels were going up. That is really the position, and we take full responsibility; but we also take full responsibility for letting the people who are on the spot act in the circumstances which they know.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);128;The right hon. Gentleman has anticipated the point I was going to make. I said that was being determined. The question of the future representation there, whether by ambassador or consul, is obviously one for consideration. I am not prepared to answer that straight off. Similarly, I cannot answer the right hon. Member for Saffron Walden with a positive statement that I will say here and now that an aircraft carrier will go. I am not accustomed to taking decisions of that kind without consulting very fully with our Service advisers. I do not think that it is wise for anyone to get up in the House and to say that we are going to send this, that and the other, without having a proper and full consultation.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);125;I am afraid that I was out of the Chamber. That is the answer to the main points that have been raised in this Debate. There has been, as I have said, a good deal of tendency to change this into a broad survey of the whole position in the Far East and not only in the Far East but in South-East Asia. The Committee knows that we have been pursuing a policy in South-East Asia. A suggestion was made with regard to Burma, and we have been endeavouring to help Burma. We collaborate with both the Indians and the Pakistanis, and of course in the Far East we are in close touch with our Southern Dominions, and also with the United States of America.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);26;I cannot say more than that consultation is going on with regard to the particular radio that shall be sent out, its strength, and so forth.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);26;Plans have been made. Obviously I cannot give the plans in detail, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the fullest plans are being made.

In more modern times, the  validity of the old Treaties was recognised in the Treaties of Arbitration concluded with Portugal in 1904 and 1914. Article I of the Treaty of 1373 runs as follows:

Of course, when there was a general election naturally I had to, but not in those years of the war; nor indeed was such great attention concentrated upon them by the Conservative Party who completely ignored many matters which afterwards proved of great importance to them.

Gentleman has given a paraphrase of what I said, and anyone can see what a trustworthy witness he is by listening to and comparing the grotesque travesty which he has uttered with what I have actually said. It is quite true that I did not accuse the right hon. Gentleman of not having taken an interest in the war. Of course, he did. He took an interest in some other matters, too—very much more, if I may say so, than any man in this House. We had accepted—[HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] There is nothing to answer. [Laughter.] I always notice that the party opposite indulge in laughter which resembles the crackling of thorns under a pot whenever they are confronted with any mental proposition which their intelligence forces them to resent or to reject.

1948-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-16;Representation Of The People Bill;138;I have regained possession of the House. I had resolved to be present tomorrow when the right hon. Gentleman makes his speech, because he himself has on record a number of quite remarkable quotations, which I have seen and which he used at the time, but I do not think it would be wise for him to anticipate, in the course of an interruption, the oration which he is to deliver. I am sure I am very glad, however, to see that he feels the force of the point which I am putting to him. To his colleagues who sit upon the opposite Front Bench, I say that the honour of a great party is involved, and also, I must say, the self-respect of several important Ministers, particularly the Prime Minister and the Lord President of the Council.

I have not been able to listen to any of them but, of course, behind the scenes, in the preparation of this Measure, I have had over the last year continuous opportunities to acquaint myself, as far as possible, with the general flow of opinion on the controversial questions involved. I hope my apology will be accepted, because I thought it right at this moment to suggest a somewhat unexpected course which I think will be found, when it is carefully considered, helpful to our affairs in general, and also to particular matters which we have in hand and to which the House has devoted so much attention and thought. Above all, we need to preserve our sense of proportion. There are all sorts of matters which are extremely important upon which we might expend a great deal of energy and pugnacity, but at present we must keep our pugnacity, as far as possible, for export purposes. It seems to me that the Government would be much to blame if they so handled their public business as to bring about unnecessary, or at any rate premature, schisms and disputes between those who have only one object, namely, our safe and victorious emergence from our horrible struggle with Germany.

We cannot afford to lose this Bill. I think we are all agreed about that, and, therefore, I think we are all agreed that, as far as to-day goes, we can postpone these Clauses, because to plunge in upon them will frustrate the desire to get the Bill and cause trouble. I am quite ready to say that the Government would rather have the Bill, with the Clauses, in a broadly agreed form, than have the Bill go forward and another Bill come along to overtake it. If we have to choose between that and losing the Bill, we would rather have this cumbersome method of the tank being separated from the engine, and the engine having to go back and catch it. We are all agreed what to do this afternoon. So far as I can make out, it is pretty nearly universal. There are the week-end and Monday, and I certainly think that discussions should proceed, through the usual channels and also in the Cabinet, to see whether we can save this Bill and have an agreed compensation Clause.

We must know where we are. It is no good getting vexed about it. I think what we might get vexed about would be if things were not clear. I always try to make things clear so that every hon.

As I said, the Bill has to go to another place and that may take some time. I am afraid that if it runs to the end of the Session we shall lose the Bill, and I do not want to lose it. What we have said is that we should move to drop the Clauses now. We have control of the Bill for perhaps eight or nine days before it must go upstairs, if it is to go any further. In this period it is my hope that we may reach some agreement which will easily enable these Clauses to be reinstated. If that fails, then the suggestion I made earlier will come into operation.

At any rate I give it my wholehearted support. I agree with the Prime Minister that we cannot easily or lightly add words to those which were spoken yesterday under the promptings and spur of this loss, but it is a very great loss. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Our feelings grow. Not only is it a loss to our country but to millions of people who live in the Middle East, and it is very fitting that the Prime Minister should have moved, and be supported, as I am sure he will be, by the whole House, this Motion recording our grief and our sympathy. I have no doubt that it will carry far and wide throughout the Arab and the Israelite world and to wider regions our feelings of admiration for the great Arab statesman who has gone, and our earnest hope that his memory will be preserved, and his work not found to be in vain.

There have been important changes in the constitutional relations between the various parts of the Commonwealth since the Committee of Imperial Defence was established in 1904; and in the conditions of today other methods of Commonwealth  consultation and co-operation in defence are more effective and appropriate.

It is my duty to offer him and the Government our congratulations upon the successful issue of this difficult and, as at one time it seemed, almost superhuman exercise of the air lift, which has shown a method of solving a deadlock and difficulty far preferable to some others which might have been considered at one time or another. I feel that the firmness which has been shown and the powerful aid and consistent policy of the United States, with whom we have worked hand in hand, have quite appreciably lessened the sense of war tension which has hung over us as each day brought out difficult incidents in Berlin. It is a matter in which we all rejoice, and on this side of the House we are very glad that we never faltered in steady support of the policy of His Majesty's Government and of the Foreign Secretary in the whole of this anxious business. We gladly pay our tribute to them. It only shows how important national unity is in these matters and how desirable it is to exclude party fights as far as possible from these large and important fields.

The present publication is a reprint of the broadcasts which have already appeared in the Press. Lord Halifax was aware of this development. I might add that the varying reproductions in the Press gave a partial impression which the publication corrects, though the publication naturally reaches only a small part of the public who have already heard the broadcasts. In regard to the last part of the Supplementary Question, I think that it was quite proper that publication should be made after the regular formalities had been complied with, although, of  course, it does not express any opinion except that of the very able public servant who was responsible for it.

Needless to say this is not the time for us to debate them.

The extent and the timing of it would perhaps be best discussed through the usual channels. It is our desire to meet the House. In regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe (Mr. J. Hynd), I cannot give the details in a statement like this. I think it would be much better to await the debate.

1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;33;My hon. Friend is inaccurate in that. What I said at that time was that that was the most we could manage without taking special measures. We are now taking those special measures.

Broadly speaking we shall try to get the people on the basis of those who last served to be called. If we are doing so on the basis, as we must, of getting the men who are required for the tasks, it may be that there are key men in certain places who will be required, and who have actually served.

1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;65;The hon. Member will recall that that is one of the matters which I discussed when I was at Washington, and not only the allocation of raw materials, but also the searching out in order to increase the supply. If I may refer to the previous question, I think that was covered by what I said about  reservists who would be retained for essential work.
1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;65;I think that the hon. Member must look a little more closely into this. Apart from what is called the armaments industry, rearmament does cover an immense range of industries—sub-contracting and so on, the engineering industry and the rest. From the point of view of practical politics it is out of the question to nationalise the whole or every part of industry engaged in rearmament.
1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;9;That will be dealt with later on in detail.

We shall speak our minds upon them with no other thought but what is the best method of securing the safety of our endangered country.
1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;106;I should like my hon. Friend to realise the nature of the problem with which we are faced. It is not just the question of getting so many individuals; it is getting people who have had the training, and who fit in, and therefore make a complete unit. A general appeal for recruits would not do that; therefore there is need for this selective call-up. I need hardly say that it is open for volunteers of the Territorial Army, the Regular Army and the other forces to come forward.

1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Steamship "Domala" (Enemy Attack);123;The steamship "Domala" was carrying passengers to India who had been recently released from Germany to be repatriated. These were mainly lascars who had been serving on German ships before the war. Within a short time after their release the ship was attacked by night, and 100 of the passengers and crew were killed. The ship was adequately armed both with high and low angle guns to provide protection against aircraft or submarine  attack, but she was attacked suddenly by an aircraft assumed to be friendly, and therefore her guns were not brought into action. A destroyer which was close at hand was similarly misled. I must repeat my general statement that no guarantee against occasional losses can be given by the Admiralty.

1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Steamship "Domala" (Enemy Attack);37;It is very difficult when individual aircraft comes to areas of this kind, and very often the first attack in a particular area is successful, but afterwards arrangements are made which prevent such attacks from being successful.
1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;Torpedoed Ships (Survivors' Leave);66;It is the intention of the Admiralty that the survivors of any of His Majesty's ships which may be sunk during the war, should be granted a period of leave before they are drafted to other duty. Leave was so given to the survivors of His Majesty's Ship "Courageous" and His Majesty's Ship "Royal Oak" and this practice will be continued, provided the manning situation permits.

In my statement published on 13th August, I declared the intention of His Majesty's Government to devote all their efforts to making the new discovery serve the purpose of world peace and to co-operate with others to that end.

1945-8-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-8-21;Atomic Energy (Advisory Committee);35;The policy, of course, has to be decided by the Government, but this Committee will advise us both with regard to the scientific progress and the possibilities and the general background of the whole subject.

This covers the relationships between the various Departments concerned.
1954-12-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-12-22;Fighter Aircraft (Deliveries);21;No, Sir. I am not proposing to hold any special inquiry, but a continuous examination of the whole subject is proceeding.

1954-12-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-12-22;Fighter Aircraft (Deliveries);26;Yes, Sir, I think that when the general question of business is gone into when we meet together again we must see what is most convenient.
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);15;May I draw the attention of the Minister to the King's Regulations, paragraph 17 (2): 
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);3;I will continue. 
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);15;I am in possession of the House as long as you permit it, Mr. Speaker.
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);45;We ought to be able to discuss these matters. In view of this perfectly clear paragraph in the King's Regulations, may I ask the right hon.

1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);8;Is this for the Navy or the Army?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);25;I have read a passage which entirely contradicts that and which was taken from the King's Regulations for the Naval Services. Surely that is relevant——
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);13;Surely that is relevant in this matter and what I ask is this——
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);41;What I ask, arising from that, is this: Was permission given by the First Lord of the Admiralty or other Ministerial authority to the First Sea Lord to enter upon this subject in the manner which has been attributed to him?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);24;But is it not very desirable to keep the high naval and military professional authorities, actively serving, out of matters of controversy in Parliament?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);31;Now, with very great respect, I put this question to the Prime Minister. Does he approve of the Minister of Defence deliberately justifying what has been a breach of King's Regulations?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);53;Does the right hon.

1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);1;What?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);1;But——
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);5;On a point of order——
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);18;Yes, Sir; it seems to be the only way one is allowed to speak in this House. [Interruption.]
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);83;On a point of order. Is it not a very insulting charge for the Minister of Defence to make, that I should have adopted—[Interruption.] Hon. Gentlemen opposite are afraid to hear the case put—a totally different view of King's Regulations, if the First Sea Lord's opinions had been of a very different  nature from those which have been expressed? Is it not very much better that all parties should join together to keep the professional heads of the Services out of political matters?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);50;Will the right hon.

1944-5-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-5-10;Dominion Prime Ministers (Meetings);50;In view of the wide range of subjects already under discussion, and the limited time available, I doubt whether it will be practicable for this question to be discussed specifically at the current meeting.

1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;Boys (Active Service);152;There are just under 5,000 boys under 18 years of age serving at sea, of whom 137 have been casualties. The Navy is a voluntary service and secures a large part of its personnel by the recruitment of continuous service boys between the ages of 15 and 16½. The consent of their parents is obtained before entry. Training at sea is an essential part of a boy's training, and the great majority of these boys go to sea from the age of 17 upwards. There they perform the task appropriate to their age and training and form an essential part of the ship's company. It is not proposed to alter a system which has been the traditional method of providing personnel for the Navy. In future, however, the consent of the parents will be obtained if, in an exceptional case, the boy's training at sea will start below the age of 17.
1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;Boys (Active Service);67;I have considered the matter very carefully. As I say, we have 5,000 boys who are an essential part of the complement of the Fleet at the moment. By making the proposal that, before the age of 17, boys may be prevented from going to sea if their parents so desire, I am making a new departure which adds to some extent to the burdens of manning.

1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);87;As the House is aware, the constitutional position in the Council of Europe is that the Assembly is a purely consultative body, on which representatives of the various member States speak and vote in a personal capacity without in any way committing the Governments of those States, or necessarily reflecting their views. Experience has shown that in an Assembly of this kind, private Members can more appropriately take part than Ministers who will naturally be assumed to be committing their Government to a particular course of action.
1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);19;No, the reason is the reason which I have given. The constitutional position is very different in Continental countries.

1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);53;Is it not a fact that this abstention of ministerial representation on the Consultative Committee is only another example of the steady attempt to vitiate the cause of a united  Europe, unless it is a Socialist united Europe which has been pursued by the right hon. Gentleman during the whole of his tenure?
1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);71;The right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. The whole basis of representation is that individual members should speak in an individual capacity, and, as the right hon. Gentleman would find out if he was in office, there is an obvious difficulty in having Ministers there owing to the confusion as to whether what is spoken by a Minister is spoken as a member of the Government or in an individual capacity.

May I ask whether the only step necessary to bring about this change and procure a new Ruling from you was that the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Committee made a representation to you? Was that the only basis? Is that so, Sir? Did they both make the representation to you?
1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Standing Committees (Composition);67;With great respect, Sir. This is not a question of advice, but of a Ruling. The entire basis of our discus-  sions in Standing Committees has now been changed—changed by altering one figure to the advantage of the Government. That is a very formidable and serious step to have taken. It is an event to which I have not seen a parallel in 50 years' Parliamentary experience.

But I have read not only the newspaper reports but the Hansard Report to a very large extent, and I have spent since yesterday a good deal of time discussing the position with various friends and colleagues. I did notice that a request was made that there should be some statement from a War Cabinet Minister, and in deference to that request, I thought perhaps I should say a very few words in order to clarify, so far as possible, the situation.
1943-10-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-13;Coalmining Situation;140;I do not say it would be impossible. It would certainly not be so difficult as it would have been during the blitz, though perhaps the blitz might recommence which would add to the gaiety of the proceedings. But still it would be very harmful to the war effort. Moreover such a policy would probably  be preceded by a break-up of the present Administration and a separation of parties into the regular lines of political battle. I could not be responsible, as at present advised, for undertaking any further great change, and certainly not a permanent great change in the mining industry during the war, because that I think would require to be ratified or preceded by a national mandate. Therefore, we must resist all such proposals, and we must ask for the support of the House in so doing.
1943-10-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-13;Coalmining Situation;185;I earnestly hope that it may be possible to preserve national unity after the war, but I say quite frankly that I should not be at all alarmed for the future of this country if we had to return to party government. We may have to do that. But this I will say—and the House will pardon me, I am sure, for saying it—that whatever bitternesses or differences and party fighting may have to take place among us, each representing our constituencies and our convictions, whatever may take place, things can never be quite the same again. Friendships have been established, ties have been made between the two parties, minglings have taken place, understandings have been established which, without any prejudice to men's public duty, will undoubtedly have a mellowing effect on a great deal of our relations in the future, and for my part I must say that. I feel I owe a great debt to the Labour Party, who were a most stalwart support to me at the time when I first undertook the burdens which I am still being permitted to bear.

Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith), who spoke for the Opposition, into the very wide field which he has traversed, and which at points he has illuminated, it is because I hope that later on in the Session we shall have it discussed in a Debate on the Committee of Imperial Defence, or on the salary of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence. I presume that that is so. I address myself directly to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. It always has been so, but if there is not to be such a Debate—

Gentleman would not, I am sure, wish to confine all requests made to him to the usual channels. Members in the House have a perfect right to put questions and to raise points about Votes to be discussed, and I asked, in a passing remark, whether there would not be the usual opportunity given for a general discussion on the three arms combined. At any rate, it is for that reason, because I expect that such an opportunity will be given, that I do not attempt to follow the speaker from the Opposition Front Bench into the very interesting survey which he has made. But there is one point to which I will certainly refer. He spoke of the number of aeroplane squadrons which in the last War were retained in this country at critical times by the fear of air attack, and the great diminution in our effective air force at the front which was entailed thereby. But that is going to happen in every country and over a far larger sphere than has, I think, been realised. The fact that air attack has spread this vast general alarm throughout the whole area of countries is going to mean that the feature of the next war—and, after all, that is the war that, from a military point of view, we must consider, though certainly the War Office is said to be always preparing for the last war—the feature of the next war will be a very vast diminution in the offensive power at the front, because of the enormous abstraction from the resources of the nations which will be frittered away, or dispersed, or in many cases wasted, over a vast area of home defence, against this attack from the sky.

I found myself in very general agreement with the Prime Minister in the closing part of his address, and am fully able to associate myself with him, for reasons which I will presently venture to dwell upon, in his broad conclusion that the action which has been taken by the United States and endorsed, supported and aided by His Majesty's Government gives, on the whole, the best chance of maintaining the peace of the world.

But some examination may be made of dates when various communications were made in different quarters, and this must all be carefully considered before I can attempt to make an answer.

1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;154;The hon. Member seems much disturbed about this matter today. He must not endeavour to direct on me any criticism which should rightly be attributed to his leader. We have next  the White Paper by the Minister of Defence. I must again remind the House that the right hon. Gentleman used very hard language about the arguments of his political opponents, the other night, and about their style. No more barren, dismal, flatulent, platitudinous document than his White Paper—if you can call it "his" White Paper—has ever been laid before the House of Commons. His friends—and I am certainly a wartime friend—hope that it is to his credit that he had nothing to do with writing it. It was one of those rigmaroles and grimaces produced by the modern bureaucracy into whose hands we have fallen—a kind of vague palimpsest of jargon and officialese, with no breadth, no theme and, above all, no facts.
1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;47;—which have led us to this conclusion. I am explaining why I am going to support the Government, and perhaps find myself in the same Lobby as the hon. Gentleman. If I give way to him, perhaps he will bear that in mind, and mitigate his ferocity.
1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;179;That really is a question which should be addressed to the Front Bench opposite. As I say, I stand here confronted with this proposal to have a National Service Bill. I and my Friends, after careful thought, feel bound to give it loyal support. That does not at all deprive us of the full right to point out how very badly other things have been managed, and how much one is in agreement with the feeling the hon. Gentleman has just expressed. Compulsory military service is not necessarily a problem for a regular standing Army; but the only way of making us a nation of fighting men in time of war is by national service in time of peace. As all our habits in the past have been to live in a peaceful manner, we have entered all our wars unprepared or ill-prepared, and the delay before we are able to place an army in the field at the side of our Allies has been a very serious weakness, not only in the physical but in the moral sphere.
1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;157;Certainly. I am much in favour of national service being on a basis of absolute equality. There used to be a period when it was possible to hire substitutes—it was so in the American Civil War—but these practices have long passed away. There is nothing contrary to the principles of democracy. On the contrary, it emphasises the principle of equality of sacrifice, and by mingling all classes together, in common duty and honourable service, it is a favourable agent for diminishing class differences which exist in a free and varied society. It has been defended and practised by all the most advanced democratic countries in Europe since the French Revolution. Reliance for the defence of the soil on national armies rather than on long service professionals, or mercenaries as they were called, was, in the 19th century, at any rate, a strong barrier against reaction in a rapidly changing and, upon the whole, advancing and progressing world.

If there is a Parliament which is against the prolongation of such a Measure, no such Measure can be prolonged, whatever the provisions in the Bill. On the other hand, if there were a general feeling that it was in accordance with the national interest and not in disharmony with the characteristics of our British life, it might be that the House would be content to see it passed through without it being a great cause of dissension.

The Government are in the position of a Government that has to be constantly on the watch all the time. Its Members have to be there. On the other hand, the position of the Opposition is that at any time they can direct an attack. Last night there was a Debate on the Adjournment. I think the Adjournment was taken in order to  give the greatest scope to the Opposition for their speeches rather than taking the Debate on the specific matter of the Consolidated Fund. Towards the end of that Debate it was intimated that there was to be a Division.

In any event, I am quite right about the right hon.

Why was it necessary for this measure, this step which you thought was right to be taken yesterday, to be left to a Private Member of the House by invoking this doctrine of saying he would raise the matter on the Adjournment? You surely have the power, not only by the rules of order, but by your own personal appeal to the House; by the power of calling other Business, and, if I may say so, by the respect entertained for the Chair, to do it yourself. I do not see why it was necessary that the right hon. Gentleman opposite should have been employed at all.

1951-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-01;Korea (United Nations Resolution);156;It is rather difficult to follow exactly in detail the full statement which the right hon. Gentleman has made without having the documents referred to paragraph by paragraph before us, and it is not very clear, from what we have heard, what the whole of this statement amounts to. But I presume we are right in assuming that the representatives of His Majesty's Government will vote with the United States on the resolution declaring China to be an aggressor in North Korea—[Interruption]—I am only asking. I would like to know—and that this agreement will be maintained, though after a great deal of discussion, with the United States on these cardinal issues? If that is so we are very glad indeed, and we are particularly relieved to feel that no breach between Great  Britain and the United States, even though concerned with a tangle of words, would occur at such a grave juncture in our joint fortunes.

There are no secrets in this House, and there ought not to be. I heard the right hon.

1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);74;Yes, but things have happened since September, and I am, in principle, in favour now of the whole of these demands, subject to their correct examination. I think that is perfectly reasonable. But they are entirely new demands; they are a new version, an afterthought, and a reconsideration of the facts which were long before Parliament and the public, and which simply arise out of requests which I will mention before I sit down.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);105;If I went too far, I should come to that period of complete victory over all our enemies which was at that time thought to be a subject of general rejoicing. But I am not going back so far as that. After the end of the war, on 22nd October, 1945, I urged the Government to speed up their demobilisation plans, which the National Government had made, so that as early as possible in 1946 the Forces should be reduced to definite ceilings pending the work of settling peace-time requirements. I gave the following figures: Army, 1 million; Navy, 150,000; Royal Air Force, 400,000—total, 1,550,000.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);50;I am not arguing with the right hon. Gentleman. [HON. MEMBERS: "Give way."] I have all the afternoon before me in which to unfold the arguments I wish to make, and, consequently, I am not at all restive under interruptions.

1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);902;They would have been a great deal better equipped if a wiser process had been followed. The squandering and destruction of what might have been carefully put away in care and maintenance, and thus preserved for use should other trouble come, was a lack of foresight. [Interruption.] I never said anything about the Lord President of the Council, although I have no doubt that he had as much to do with it as anybody else, and much more than his right hon. Friend the Minister of Defence on his right flank. [HON. MEMBERS: "Get on with it."] I shall not be hurried at all; I shall take my time in dealing with every interruption, because I feel I have a perfectly legitimate right to unfold this case in my own way. In the United States, in spite of many temptations, less improvidence was shown, especially in respect to warships. I may remind the House again that the figure for the Services which I mentioned of 1,550,000 is double that to which the Forces were later reduced. And even now, according to the Defence Minister's speech of yesterday, it will not be until 1952 that an overall figure of 900,000 can be reached. I say this because this has been made an accusation against me. I think it was the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who made that attack the other day. I sent him some  figures correcting it, which he had not the courtesy to acknowledge. I agree that the mistakes made at the beginning put us on the wrong line, but no British Government in time of peace has ever had the powers that Socialist Ministers have wielded, or the resources they have consumed. In 1946, they took the step, with our full support, of introducing National Service in peace-time. First, 18 months was the term, then 12 months, and then 18 months again according to the changing winds. Now it is two years. Before the late General Election, I said to the House that the principle which might help us in economising our money and our manpower, and in getting better value from the sacrifices demanded, would be to take fewer men and to hold them longer. We all know how that was used at the election. Nevertheless, we have supported the Government in their further steps. Undoubtedly, the two years' service was far more suited to our dangers and to our special problems than anything else they proposed before. If it had been introduced in 1947 or 1948, when the skies began to darken—and we should certainly have supported the Government—how much better off we should be in effective military formations today? One has the feeling that if the position had been studied by the Minister of Defence and other Ministers responsible —and they have changed often, not always for the better—very good solutions might have been reached. But the Government deal in words, in declarations, in projects and in schemes which seem to indicate impressive action. Alas, it is mainly on paper—committee to committee, declaration to declaration, one edition after another of their proposals for National Defence. But with the control they have demanded over our manpower, and with the vast sums of money voted so constantly by the House, it ought to have been possible to produce a substantial and efficient Army. I do not say an adequate army, but a substantial and efficient army. But what has happened? With Defence Estimates of nearly £1,000 million a year for five or six years, and with their unprecedented control of manpower, they have produced so few effective tactical units that when the Korean trouble broke out and it was necessary  for us to send a token force—I have never advocated sending more than a token force—to Korea under the authority of the United Nations, it took over three months to produce even a brigade group of good quality. But talk and waste and muddle have robbed the nation of the results of resources which, whether adequate or not, Parliament at their request conferred upon the Government on a very large scale. Another subject of grave complaint is the inability of the Government to produce any atomic bombs of our own in the five and a half years which have passed since the war. When we remember how far we were ahead, and how we were able to deal on equal terms with the United States, it is indeed depressing to feel that we have been outstripped by the Soviets in this field. I take the opportunity of repeating now my request that the document I signed with President Roosevelt in the war should be made public at an early date. We must not forget that by creating the American atomic base in East Anglia we have made ourselves the target, and perhaps the bull's eye of a Soviet attack. On 28th March, last year, I said in Parliament: "If, for instance, the United States had a stock-pile' of 1,000 atomic bombs—I take the figure as an illustration merely; I have no knowledge of any sort of kind of what they have—and Russia had 50, and we got those 50, fearful experiences, far beyond anything we have ever endured, would be our lot."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 28th March, 1950; Vol. 473, c. 201.] I say the total failure of the Government to hold its own and to keep up development—
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);80;The right hon. Gentleman really ought not to mislead the country on a matter like this. He knows perfectly well it was by his agreement, and the agreement of the Government of which I was a Member, that the development of the atomic bomb and the making and everything took place across the other side of the Atlantic, and it is utterly untrue to suggest there has been a failure to develop it here. It is entirely wrong of him.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);73;At the end of the war we resumed full freedom to make the atomic bomb ourselves. The only reason we did not make it during the war was  that we were under air bombardment. We had not got a safe place here and the United States therefore had the facility and the credit of making it. At the end of the war we were perfectly free to resume manufacture. Is not that correct?
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);19;Certainly, I have answered "Yes." I am sorry if the right hon. Gentleman cannot hear me. I said "Yes."
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);27;Then what is the complaint about what I have said, that in the five and a half years no success has rewarded our efforts in making it?
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);52;The right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. There has been successful development. He is not producing any evidence whatever to show that, given the resources and possibilities over here as compared with the resources they have in the United States of America, we could have done more than we have done now.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);47;What is the meaning of that interruption? I say we have not succeeded in making the atomic bomb completely in this country in the five and a half years since the war. Does anybody challenge that? [Interruption.] All right, find something to cheer at if you can.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);68;If I were wrong, the Government would readily correct me. If I am right it is more important for people to know the facts than it is for the Russians, who are constantly doing their utmost. And after all, we have of course the aid of the United States to look to in the matter, which I quite agree is incomparably greater than anything we could have done.

Member that, if he is calculating on divisions inside our party he is making a calculation which is as woefully inaccurate as most of those of his leaders  have been about this great question of military policy. Since the Minister of Defence was so haughty, I will quote what I said on 27th July last: 
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);78;It is undoubted that in my long life I have used the word "doubled." The only additions to the new construction announced last March are 41 new minesweepers and some small craft. Is that sufficient, when we con-  sider the enormous increase both in output and in numbers with which we should be confronted in Russian U-boats over those of the Germans, which, at the outset of the war, were such a very great immediate pre-occupation to us?

The first one concerns my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, but I understand that he has public duties which make it difficult for him to attend the Chamber this afternoon, and I will therefore make my point to the Under-Secre-  tary of State and to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and rely upon their good offices to convey anything they may think of the slightest interest or value to their colleague. Last Tuesday night the right hon. Gentleman made the following statement: 
1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;41;No, but I would submit that, after all, many Members can testify from their own personal experience that even on the exceedingly high standard required, there is no reason for any anxiety, and certainly no ground for founding a general aspersion.

1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;130;I am speaking now of the spring of 1935. At that time, when this story of first-line aircraft was brought up, we were told how much better our machines would be because we had started late and we should have the advantage, and how much larger our reserves would be. All that was in relation to the machines for the 31st March, 1937. I cannot charge my memory with the debates, but I will make a search of them. I have, however, little doubt that the impression left upon the House was, and it was intended to be left upon the House, that by 31st March, 1937, we should have an Air Force of 1,500 first-line strength, equipped with good modern machines. That was the idea. That was the plan.
1951-2-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-12;Divisions (Points Of Order);51;May I venture to ask you, Mr. Speaker, in view of all we have heard—which we were not aware was to be raised—whether you do not feel it entirely within your rights to take time to consider what your answer may be and to ascertain some opinions from other hon. Members?
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;97;I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of that statement which you have read to us, Mr. Speaker, which shows that the Committee of Privileges were misinformed and that this House has been misled, so that it has passed a Resolution which has been interpreted as laying blame on entirely innocent persons, it is not undesirable that that should remain on the records of this House; and whether the Prime Minister will not move that the Resolution of the House be rescinded, and the matter again inquired into by the Committee of Privileges?
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;178;The Leader of the Opposition was good enough to give me notice that he intended to put the question which the House has heard, so I have had a brief opportunity of considering the subject. The conclusion I arrived at is the same as that suggested by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair), that, on the whole, it would be better to leave the matter, as you suggest, Sir, where it is, because it is established, so far as this House is concerned, that a breach of Privilege was committed, and it is established that that breach of Privilege was in the summoning of the hon. Member in the circumstances detailed in the Report of the Committee of Privileges. It does not really make any difference so far as the House is concerned who summoned him; the breach of Privilege has been established, whoever summoned him. As the right hon. Gentleman the Member for  Caithness and Sutherland has reminded us, this matter is still under the consideration of the Select Committee——
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;40;This point is very important. My right hon. Friend says that this Privilege matter is now under the consideration of the Select Committee. How can that be, seeing that the Select Committee was set up anterior to this incident occurring?
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;180;Perhaps it was not explicit enough when I said that this was under the consideration of the Select Committee. I did not mean that the question of Privilege was under the Select Committee, but I meant the whole story, and, in particular, the actions of the Ministers concerned. The House has had to spend a good deal of time over this, and it is desirable that we should not give the country the impression that we are spending too much time. If it be the case, as you have suggested, Sir—and I think it is the case—that there is no reflection upon anybody concerned with the summoning, I do not think there is any particular object in sending it back to the Committee of Privileges. I think the House will agree when I say it would be unwise to put down another Motion to rescind the report of the Committee which has already been presented to us and debated by the House. It would mean that the matter would have to be referred to the Committee of Privileges once again.

1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);77;Yes, certainly, but this is a question of considering whether a statement which has, I understand, been put out very fully in the public Press, is necessarily to be circulated as a White Paper before it has been considered whether or not any comments, and the rest, should be put out with it. Sometimes, it may be a waste of time. I will certainly consider in what way we can assist the House best in this matter.

MEMBERS: "On what?"]—The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not say there should never be any reduction in expenditure. Hon. Members should ask him on what. He has the power to answer the question, and the duty to answer the question—[An HON. MEMBER: "It is your duty too."]—I am as good a judge of my duty as the hon. Member is of his. I say that a reduction in expenditure, a substantial relief in taxation applied to increase incentives to production and earnings, especially among the wage-earners liable to direct taxation, widespread relaxation of needless and vexatious controls and interferences with the flexibility of private enterprise, the definite lifting of the shadow of further nationalisation from our most active and prosperous industries and, above all, the return to power of a Government commanding national and international confidence—all these would have created and may still create conditions in which the liberation of the pound sterling would have a good chance of opening wide doors of prosperity into the future. But by one means or another devaluation or liberation, if this step were inevitable, should have been taken as part of a general scheme of financial reform  instead of being plunged into as an isolated act forced upon us at the last moment. Again and again the Chancellor was warned from this side of the House and by financial authorities outside that he was living in a fool's paradise. But all these warnings were in vain. I think he made some remark about "Dismal Desmonds." Was that his phrase or did one of his colleagues achieve this alliterative gem? Therefore, whatever may be thought of the relative advantages or disadvantages of devaluing or liberating the pound sterling, the timing of the step was obviously wrong. A drastic alteration in the exchange rate, if proved necessary, should not have been left till the crisis broke upon us but should have been taken in anticipation of it. It is not easy to palliate the right hon. and learned Gentleman's blunder. We all know the abilities of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In his position he had more and better information on the subject at his disposal than anyone else in the world. He ought, surely, to have exercised foresight and decision in good time before our remaining gold reserves had been drained away and he was forced higgledy-piggledy into action which we know he loathed, under the worst possible circumstances. I am sorry not to see the Lord President of the Council in his place because I wish to quote with great approval some remarks which he has made on this subject: "The real problem of statesmanship …" said the Lord President of the Council in June, 1946— "in the field of industry and economics is to see trouble coming and to prevent ourselves getting into the smash. We are determined that we are not going to be caught unawares by blind economic forces under this Administration." But that is exactly what has happened to his colleague the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He could not possibly have described it in more precise or harmonious language. In fact, it has almost a prophetic aspect about it. I come to another point. The question is much discussed in the country of the Chancellor's political honesty. Ordinary people find it difficult to understand how a Minister, with all his knowledge and  reputation for integrity, should have felt it right to turn completely round, like a squirrel in its cage, abandon his former convictions and do what he repeatedly said he would never do, and moreover, enforce upon his party and his most faithful followers the humiliating tergiversation which we have witnessed. I am surprised, I must say, that the Chancellor's own self-respect did not make him feel that, however honest and necessary was his change of view, his was not the hand that should carry forward the opposite policy. Certainly he stands woefully weakened in reputation, first by his lack of foresight, and secondly, by having had completely to reverse the reasoned convictions with which he made us familiar. Of course, we know that changes in currency cannot be announced beforehand. The secret had to be kept. It was certainly very well kept, perhaps too well kept considering the position of some of our friendly countries like France. But we congratulate the Chancellor—and he will agree with this—and the Foreign Secretary on the high art which they displayed in the necessary process of deception. The histrionic quality of their performance was indeed remarkable. But I am not speaking of the last month but of the position three and four months ago. I have been shown nine quotations from the Chancellor's speeches declaring himself the inveterate opponent of devaluation. It is very important that our Chancellor of the Exchequer should have foresight. It is also desirable that he should have consistency, as far as possible. It is important that Parliament and the country should believe that when he speaks at that Box opposite he means what he says. Otherwise, how can people attach the weight to his declarations and pledges without which a Chancellor of the Exchequer is grievously crippled? How he of all men could adopt the policy, "What I tell you nine times is untrue," is most astonishing. Although his personal honour and private character are in no wise to be impugned, it will be impossible in the future for anyone to believe or accept with confidence any statements which he may make as Chancellor of the Exchequer from that Box. He stands convicted of lamentable lack of foresight. His usefulness, for all his abilities in the great office  he holds, has been definitely impaired, and I find it most difficult to believe that he would have been content to stay in office if he had thought the ordeal was likely to be a long one. It is odd that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his present weak and vulnerable position should feel entitled to judge his predecessors with so much severity and to impute wrong and unworthy motives to them. The right hon. and learned Gentleman referred yesterday to my action in returning to the Gold Standard a quarter of a century ago. He said that his policy today was a substitution for the alternative policy of severe deflation. "That policy"— I quote his words from HANSARD— "was pursued at one time under the aegis of the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and depended for its efficacy upon a massive extension of unemployment, with the accompanying lowering of wage rates and so the impoverishment of the employed and unemployed."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th September, 1949; Vol. 468, c. 25.] There were loud cheers from hon. Gentlemen opposite. This was a very aggressive and I may even say offensive reference to past history. To suggest that people would like to see other people unemployed is I think deserving—[Interruption.] I will pick my epithets with care, and I have a large collection of them—is I think deserving of the word "offensive." I think that the whole passage in which he referred to me is singularly out of keeping with the governess and sermon-like passages of some other parts of his discourse. I must say that I am obliged to him for making his accusations here, where they can be answered, instead of circulating them, as is no doubt being done far and wide at this present moment by his party propaganda machine.

We should like to hear something about that.

1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;147;I should like for one moment to make my apology to the House and to say that whatever has happened is entirely my fault, because with a singular lack of that precipitancy for which I have of ten been blamed, I did not notice the point upon which my hon. Friend finished his speech. I thought there were two or three more words in his sentence, and therefore I did not immediately jump up. I will gladly give way to any hon. Member, but I do not think that it has ever  been the rule that the first person who gets up is the person to be called. [Interruption.] The hon. Member who has just sat down is clearly a strong partisan of the Arab point of view. He has told us how he has served in the field with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster—
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;265;I misunderstood the hon. Member, but, at any rate, he is well acquainted with the Arab problems and speaks with a strong feeling for their point of view. I do not consider that we are altogether in a free and easy position in this House in regard to this question. Pledges have been given on both sides. The pledge which all the world regarded with considerable attention, and which was mentioned by the Secretary of State in his speech, is undoubtedly the Balfour Declaration of policy put forward by the War Cabinet in the crisis of the Great War. It is a delusion to suppose that this was a mere act of crusading enthusiasm or quixotic philanthropy. On the contrary, it was a measure taken, as the right hon. Gentleman who led us in the crisis of the War knows, in the dire need of the War with the object of promoting the general victory of the Allies, for which we expected and received valuable and important assistance. We cannot brush that aside and start afresh as though it had never been given, and deal with this matter as if we had no obligations or responsibility. Therefore, I am bound to say that upon this issue, having studied the question as far as I can and having some personal connection and responsibility for it, I should have preferred the Government to have persevered in the old policy of persuading one side to concede and the other to forbear, and to carry forward that policy, hard and heavy though it may be, with all its inconveniences.

The right hon. Gentleman, in speaking to that Amendment, indicated that he was proposing to move an Amendment to the Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) has explained that, as far as we are concerned, the proposed Amendment to the Amendment will not meet our position at all and that, therefore, we are persisting in our Amendment and intend to take it to a vote. Therefore, in my submission the Debate should continue on the Amendment which we wish the House to adopt.

1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;31;I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, in line 1, to leave out from the word "proposals" to the end of the proposed Amendment, and to add:

1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;189;What the right hon. Gentleman said went very far to meet the difficulty which many of us have felt. Our objection to the Amendment as put forward by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) had relation to the question of binding this House to a decision here and now to accept partition; this is putting it shortly. Our intention was to accept the general policy; we did not want this House, when it came back, to be met with a Govern-  ment saying: "You sent us off with a Mandate to the Commission and tied us down to the acceptance of partition." Our point has been not in any way to try to get a party vote on this subject. We are solely concerned with having the best possible way of meeting this position in the interests of the Arab people, the Jewish people and the whole world. If this House is not tied at this moment to acceptance of the principle of the White Paper, the Government are, of course, free to take action. That is a way I think this House will want.

1949-2-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-2-03;Ministers And Public Servants (Official Conduct);36;I think the right hon. Gentleman has confused two things. One thing I said was that I propose to give guidance in a certain matter; the other was a question of an inquiry by a committee.
1949-2-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-2-03;Ministers And Public Servants (Official Conduct);129;Yes, a committee to inquire into contact men. In addition there was a question of some change in the rules affecting entry of strangers and others into this House, and hospitalities which are shared or given here. We on this side of the House have not noticed the need for such changes, and it is very difficult to change the freedom which has been indulged in by Members of all parties in the House of Commons. If it is abused, this is the kind of occasion which cleanses that abuse and makes it very unlikely that it will continue. If at times persons outside the House have come in as guests and paid for refreshments and so forth, all this will undoubtedly be stiffened up by what has occurred.

1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;28;No, Sir. I have made the announcement with regard to the termination of the Viceroyalty of Lord Wavell, and I do not propose to add anything to it.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;76;Surely, we are entitled to be treated in a reasonable manner. Is it not a fact that if Lord Wavell's Viceroyalty had ended with the war, it, would have ended 18 months ago, and that had it ended after three years, it would have ended in June last? What, then, is the reason for this difference and disagreement which have lead to the removal and dismissal of a Viceroy in the full conduct of Government policy?
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;52;The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that Lord Wavell was not appointed for a fixed term. As has been stated, it was thought that in the changing phase of the Indian problem, it was a suitable time to make a change. I do not propose to add anything to that statement.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;51;May I ask, in all humility, because the House is entitled to a reasonable explanation, why has this moment been chosen for this momentous new departure?

1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;72;I have already stated the reason—[HON. MEMBERS: "What reason?"] Will hon. Members wait a moment. I have already stated the reason in the statement I have made, that we regard it as a suitable time to make a change, owing to the change in the  phase of the Indian problem. I do not intend to say more than that. I am not aware that there is any precedent for such a request.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;58;What are the reasons which make this time appropriate for a change? There must be some reason. Surely, the right hon. Gentleman did not wake up one morning, and say, "Oh, let us get another Viceroy"? It must have some purpose or reason behind it, and we have a right to know what is that purpose or reason.

Are we not dealing with an officer who has been serving the Government in the most intimate relations? Now he is dismissed. May we not know what are the differences  which have arisen to lead to the dismissal of one Viceroy and the appointment of another? Surely that is a matter which, in the history of either House of Parliament, has never been denied fair discussion.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;56;The right hon. Gentleman is quite right about the uncertainties, and one of the reasons for this statement is to try to remove uncertainty. It is a fact that despite all the declarations we have made, there are still people in India who think they can hang on and let things drift. We are against drift.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;14;We want to bring this uncertainty to a close, in regard to this matter.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;35;That is the reason why we put in a date. I think that the matter raised by the right hon. Gentleman would be far better developed in a Debate rather than by question and answer.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;70;No. I have made it perfectly plain that it has been our constant endeavour to have settled government in India. We shall not obtain that by long continued uncertainty, and as it is the policy of this Government and I think of this House that the Indians should become responsible, I think it is time for them to face up to the fact that that responsibility is now upon them.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;58;It is not the intention to hand India over to chaos.

I was not aware of any decisive change that had been contemplated at all in this respect, though I should by no means bind myself always to follow out strictly and faithfully all the actions and policies proposed by the party opposite.

Gentleman realise that so far from there being any intention of making mischief, it is essential that the position of the Government should be made quite clear in view of the critical position of the fight against Communism in Malaya and the need for uniting all communities behind the Government, and that no statement casting doubt on the general line of policy, which, I thought, has been accepted in this House, should issue from this House? What my right hon. Friend was asking was that we may be quite clear that our purpose in defending Malaya against Communism is to help them on the road to self-government.

We have as yet received no official information which fixes the authorship of the crime or gives us a clue to its motives. The murderers themselves narrowly escaped lynching at the hands of Egyptian passers-by, and the Egyptian Government have stated that they were not Egyptian subjects. Very searching inquiries will be made into the origins and associations of these strangers to Egypt, and the House will doubtless require the fullest information as soon as it has been obtained.
1954-2-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-2-11;Departmental Documents (Disclosure);64;So far as I am aware, no procedure has been laid down which fetters the discretion of Ministers as to the exceptional occasions on which it may be necessary to bring to the notice of the House Departmental or other documents. I certainly think that every effort should be made to inform the Member concerned that a certain document is to be brought forward.
1954-2-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-11;Departmental Documents (Disclosure);146;We have discussed that matter in relation to the actual occurrence. As I said, we were accused of what is a very grave offence—the shameful betrayal of the vital interests of the British soldier. In those circumstances, it certainly was interesting to see that in the past this matter had been discussed on very even conditions without any of these formidable accusations being associated with it in any way. But, as I have said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War tells me that he wished he had had the time and the opportunity to draw the attention of the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) to it. Certainly, it would have been advantageous because he might have persuaded his neighbour, the hon. Member for Aston (Mr. Wyatt) not to cast the Motion in such a deeply dyed depth of villainy.

1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;46;In view of the opinion which you, Sir, have just expressed that my hon. Friend has made out a prima facie case, I think the proper way to handle this matter would be to refer it to the Commitee of Privileges. Therefore, I beg to move: 
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;272;This matter has arisen very suddenly, and is a matter, I think, of very grave concern to every Member of this House. The Prime Minister has moved that it be sent to the Committee of Privileges, but this seems to me to be a very unusual case of breach of privilege. It appears, prima facie, to be an affront to this House. This House has taken cognisance of certain incidents, and there is on the Order Paper a Motion to set up a Select Committee to deal with the matter. I understand that notice has been given that the Prime Minister himself will move that a Select Committee shall be set up to consider this matter. We now find that, under a Department of the Government, a tribunal has been set up to inquire into these very same matters, and that a Member of the House has been summoned, as an officer, to appear before it. It seems rather strange that this should be done under the authority of the Government, when the matter is to be considered by a Committee of Privileges set up by this House to protect the privileges of the House. The  very people who are the subject of inquiry in a cognate matter out of which this has arisen have taken the responsibility for setting up this tribunal, an action which seems to be in conflict with the authority of this House and its privileges. That seems to me to raise a difficult question. I do not know whether the Prime Minister will have anything to say with regard to the position of the Committee of Privileges.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;125;There seems to be some misunderstanding, or some attempt on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to raise some side issue. [Interruption.] I will put it in this way, that the Leader of the Opposition appears to think that the proceedings of this Court of Inquiry are somehow connected directly with instructions given to it by the Government. If so, that is a misunderstanding. I assume that for the setting up of the Court of Inquiry the Secretary of State for War is technically responsible, but in a case of this kind, where there has been divulgence of information which is alleged to be a breach of the Official Secrets Act, it would be an automatic proceeding to set up a Court of Inquiry.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;33;Once the court has been set up, the proceedings do not come under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State himself, still less of the Government. They are carried on by the court.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;201;I rise to support the Motion which the Prime Minister has made, and to thank him for having made it. On the last occasion when a Privilege issue was raised in this House, it was left to the Member who raised it himself to make the Motion, but the Prime Minister, at a later stage in the proceedings, expressed his formal concurrence with the Motion. The right hon. Gentleman, in taking this action himself, has certainly acted in accordance with the high traditions of the House. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has himself made this Motion, and that the matter is to be very strenuously tested in debate, I should like to ask him and the House about two points which arise directly out of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys) is under military orders to attend  this Court of Inquiry to-morrow, and I presume that the fact that this matter is now to be referred to the Committee of Privileges means that the Government will immediately cancel this order, or that otherwise the House and you, Mr. Speaker, will see that Privilege protects the hon. Gentleman in not complying with it.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;125;I do not propose to follow the hon. Gentleman opposite in discussing a question which, I take it, will be before the Committee of Privileges. With regard to what the hon. Baronet the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) has said, there again I think he is under some misunderstanding. A Court of Inquiry set up by the Army Council is not an inquiry into any charges against my hon. Friend the Member for Nonvood (Mr. Sandys). It is to inquire into charges made against another officer who may have divulged secret information. I cannot see that there is anything indecent in the Army Council having set up an inquiry which in the ordinary course would go into a charge of that kind.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;27;Was that disclosure of secret information based on the statement made by the hon. Member for Norwood? Is that the reason for the summoning of the inquiry?
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;52;Is it not obvious that the inquiry at the War Office is inquiring into precisely the same question as this House is to inquire into, and that they are seeking to obtain through another channel the information which was attempted to be extracted by other methods from the hon. Member for Norwood?
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;108;I understand the Secretary of State to say that, of course, he takes full responsibility for the decision of the Army Council, although he was not himself able to attend this particular meeting. May I ask my right hon. Friend whether he did not apprise the military members of the Army Council of the Motion which had been placed, or was about to be placed, on the Order Paper of the House by the Prime Minister, opening up an inquiry by a Select Committee into these or connected matters? If he did not, it seems to me that he placed his military men in rather a hard position.

Decisions of this character surely have to be given through some specific Department whose Minister is directly responsible. Is that not so? What is the "appropriate Minister"?

1949-1-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-19;Middle East (Raf Reconnaissance Flights);36;No, no; I asked a precise question.

1949-1-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-19;Middle East (Raf Reconnaissance Flights);14;Then we understand they came from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs himself?
1949-1-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-19;Middle East (Raf Reconnaissance Flights);57;The right hon. and learned Gentleman told us that one of the Ministers who asked him or instructed him to undertake these reconnaissances was the Foreign Secretary. Which other Minister, except the Prime Minister, has an equal responsibility for deciding upon these particular matters? Which other Minister? I think the Prime Minister might say something on this.
1949-1-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-1-19;Middle East (Raf Reconnaissance Flights);74;The right hon. Gentleman is very well aware that in these matters, where there is a question which may involve matters of foreign policy and high policy, a question of this kind is often discussed by.

1939-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1939-11-08;The War At Sea;271;It is now established that the "Royal Oak" was sunk in the early hours of 14th October by a German U-boat which penetrated the defences of the land-locked anchorage of Scapa Flow. These defences were of two kinds. First, the physical obstructions by nets, booms and blockships; and secondly, by small patrolling craft upon the approaches to the various entrances or Sounds, which are seven in number. Neither the physical obstructions nor the patrolling craft were in that state of strength and efficiency required to make the anchorage absolutely proof, as it should have been, against the attack of a U-boat on the surface or half-submerged at high water. Measures had been taken, and were being taken, to improve the physical obstructions, and the last blockship required reached Scapa Flow only on the day after the disaster had occurred. All the more was it necessary, while these defences were incomplete, that the patrolling craft should have been particularly numerous. But from a variety of causes, connected with the movements of the Fleet, which was not at that time using the anchorage, these patrolling craft were reduced below what was required. I am unable to enter into details, because a full explanation—and no explanation is worth giving unless it is full—would reveal to the enemy matters which would throw a light upon our methods of defence. This light would illuminate for them not only the past but the future. It would not be right to discuss in public, in time of war, these intimate matters of naval defence, and I ask the House with confidence to support the Admiralty in their decision.
1939-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-11-08;The War At Sea;352;During this opening phase of the war the Royal Navy has suffered a greater loss of life than all the other forces, French and British, on sea, on land and in the air combined. Every loss inflicted on us by the enemy has been at once announced. In addition,  since the outbreak of war one of our submarines. His Majesty's Ship "Oxley," has been destroyed by an accidental explosion in circumstances which made its publication inadvisable at the time. So far the "Royal Oak," Courageous "and" Oxley "are the only losses we have had of His Majesty's ships of war, but they are, of course, serious losses. The war at sea has, in fact, been the only war which has been proceeding on a full scale, but the House will not suppose that the losses are the only events which have been taking place at sea. What I told the House under much reserve six weeks ago, I can now repeat with more assurance, namely, that we are gaining a definite mastery over the U-boat attack. In the second four weeks of war the British tonnage lost by enemy action—72,000 tons—was less than half the amount lost during the first four weeks; and against the loss we may set 52,000 tons captured from the enemy, 27,000 tons purchased from foreigners, and 57,000 tons of new built ships, leaving in these four weeks a net gain of 64,000 tons. During the first eight weeks of war our net loss of tonnage has been less than one-third of 1 per cent. This takes no account of the important chartering operations from neutrals which are in progress. It is interesting to note that one of the most valuable of recent prizes was captured from the enemy by the "Ark Royal," which the German wireless has sunk so many times. When I recall the absurd claims which they are accustomed to shout around the world, I cannot resist saying we should be quite content to engage the entire German Navy, using only the vessels which at one time or another they have declared they have destroyed.

Would he not be wise to disabuse his mind of the possibility of this occasion and the manner in which it has been handled bringing him any large measure of compliments and congratulations from  the country as a whole? Has it not given the greatest advertisement to those whom he describes with so much just severity and has it not exposed us to a very great deal of inconvenience and laid us open to much abuse? I personally am not attacking in any way the hostility of the right hon. Gentleman and the Government towards the peace conference, but if he thinks that he has handled this matter well—or that the Government in general have, for I do not blame him in particular—if he thinks that he has handled the matter with tact, skill and discretion, he is very much mistaken.

[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Be patient. That is quite a different thing from a man who comes with an invading Army into his own country, helping a foreign nation to invade and overthrow his own country, and then, when he sees that that foreign nation is going to be beaten, changes over to the other side.

I am quite sure that the firm is under no blame and is not negligent. They only pointed out that Russian inspectors have the right to come into the factories, were pressing to come, were walking about the factories freely. and that the work in the factories both for the Government and for Russian and Polish exports was naturally mixed up together. I think it is unfair to throw blame upon them. All they did was to send their correspondence to me, and I alone am responsible for the use which, with their full permission, I made of it.

We were led to believe that the object of this Bill was only to remove doubts. It was for the purpose of removing doubts as to the working validity of the 1945 Act. We were led to believe that possibly the courts might hold that, an emergency of a peculiar character having now arisen, the phrase "transition from war to peace" would no longer cover the interim powers granted under the 1945 Act. We were led to believe that. If there was only this doubt, we thought it only right to put down an Amendment to remove the doubt. We do not seek to alter at this moment—little though we like them—the vast powers which are enjoyed by the  Government under the 1945 Act. But, it appears now that all this is wrong. There is no question of removing doubts. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has the effrontery to get up and say at that Box, "No, there is no doubt about all this." I have never heard such stuff.

We are told now that there has never been any question of doubt in this matter. Certainly we were told that there was doubt, and I have certainly every reason to believe that the doubt operated in respect of the word "existing" regulations, and that no new regulations could be made under this Bill apart from those which have already been made under the 1945 Act. After all, there is the Lord President of the Council. I have a great deal of confidence in his sense of fair play. [Laughter.] I have when it comes to a dead-level talk across the Table of the House. He knows perfectly well that we were assured that existing regulations were all that were to be involved in this Bill, and that the Government were afraid the existing regulations would be hampered by arbitrary or far-fetched constructions being put upon them by the courts, and that consequently, at a moment when there is a grave emergency, the Government's powers may be hampered and restricted.

Undoubtedly the majority in the House of Commons is effective for all legislative purposes, but a Government which represents all parties has a moral authority to deal with matters which is not possessed by a party Government seeking to carry out its class and partisan prejudices and animosities over the heads of its political opponents.

There is no sort of comparison between the dangers in which we were in June, 1940, and the kind of dangers we are now in. In 1940, the dangers were brought upon us by the terror and power of the enemy. Now the difficulties and dangers we are in, which I certainly do not wish to underrate or understate are, we hold, largely due to the mismanagement of the party opposite. That is altogether apart from their escaping from their faults, neglects and incompetence by the assumption of sweeping powers, which in their hands will only make matters worse.

Consequently the lighthouse service has never assisted us in reporting enemy activity. I think that should be noted.

The remark-  able thing, since I am drawn into this by this interruption, is that the political parties did not at all sway the influence and actions of the Indian millions. Millions of men volunteered, without conscription, to fight, and great numbers gave their aid in war work, and the political parties, who are the only parties—the hon.

As I say, I do not wish to be drawn from the straight and narrow path which I have marked out for myself in this discussion, because I might easily add to the length of the Debate, which I have no wish to do, We have had a very full statement from the Government. Nevertheless, although, as I say, we got no assistance, we declared that the offer which we had made should stand. The present Government had, therefore, a right to our agreement and support in sending out the Mission of Cabinet Ministers, who have just returned after arduous experiences. The directions given to the Mission, however, went beyond, and, as I hold, needlessly beyond, those which governed the wartime Cripps Mission of 1942. The Coalition offer was, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just reminded us, of Dominion status, which includes, of course, the Clause in the Statute of Westminster, what we might call the escalator Clause, which affirmed the right of secession, in the last resort, from the British Commonwealth of Nations by any Dominion, The Coalition offer was also conditional upon agreement being reached between the principal parties in India, so that the offer of full Dominion status, including the right to secede, would not lead to disastrous, and possibly devastating, civil war.

In the second place, the scheme which he took out was a different one. In the third place, when that scheme did not commend itself to those to whom he addressed himself, he took the positive action—and I do not say he was wrong from his point of view to do it—of trying to solve the Indian problem for the Indians instead of leaving it to the Indians to solve, or not to solve.

Gentleman had no authorisation to attempt to make a separate declaration  apart from any view built up between Indians, as he has done now. I am not making this a complaint against the right hon. and learned Gentleman; I can quite see that when they were there and nobody would agree to anything, the third party came in and said, "Let us have a try. Won't you agree to this?" All I say is, that it is quite different from the proposals to which we agreed.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);25;The right hon. and learned Gentleman has made a very long speech, but if he wants to make a further one, I will sit down.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);203;I am not making an accusation against the Government in the matter. I am sure the right hon. and learned Gentleman does not deal with people in bad faith, and those gentlemen who were there may have been misunderstood. There has been a serious misunderstanding, but the consequences of the misunderstanding carry us forward  into the future. The General Secretary of the Muslim League has gone se far as to say that unless the situation is clarified, it would be suicidal for the League to enter into a Constituent Assembly. All this appears to raise the most formidable issues, because I can assure the Government—and those who have been to India know well—that the agreement of the Muslims to the new system affects the whole foundation of the problem. One cannot contemplate that British troops should be used to crush the Muslims in the interests of the caste Hindus. Whatever our responsibilities may be, whatever may be the day appointed on which we quit India, we must not make ourselves the agents of a caste Government, or a particular sectional Government in order to crush by armed force and modern weapons, another community which, although not so numerous, is numbered at 90 millions.

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);283;I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman again but I have been tackled on this question. There is all the difference in the world. The Statute of Westminster allows every Dominion the right to secede and in the case of a great many Dominions there would be no difficulty about it, if they decided no one would raise any question. There may be, however, great differences of opinion if one of the Dominions considered a proposal to secede, and that might exercise a great deterrent upon the decision which the Dominion would take. My hope would be that such a deterrent would have the effect of making the Dominion unitedly decide to remain within the British Commonwealth, a course which, I hope, we have not altogether brushed aside. However, it is another matter when we try to short-circuit the process and say, "Take independence now." That is what the Government are going to get, and they are going to get it very soon. They should not blind themselves to the idea. There is going to be no hesitation on the part of those with whom the Government are dealing in taking full and immediate independence. That is what is going to happen. I did not hear the speech of the hon. Member for Northern Midlothian and Peebles (Lord John Hope), but every person in the House is entitled to express his or her own view in these matters. It is a well-known fact that I have differed in past years from the line taken by the Conservative Government in this Parliament and I do not think we should have been in this miserable plight if my advice had been taken then.

These centres, 11 in number in England and Wales, and two in Scotland, are residential and are under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland. For those not requiring, or no longer requiring, in-patient treatment, out-patient facilities and social help are available at clinics and through other mental health agencies conducted by local authorities or voluntary bodies. These latter services are not at present complete or fully co-ordinated, but are being developed under the auspices of the Board of Control as far as war conditions allow.

If it be true, as we all earnestly hope, that the danger of a third world war has receded—and that is a matter which no one can declare with certitude—it is largely due to the exertions made by this country, by the United States and by our allies in Europe to place ourselves in a position of defence; and if at what may be a critical and delicate moment in world history we were suddenly to make a pull-back of this kind, it might do harm far outside anything we can think of.

1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);123;The hon. Gentle man had better wait. He will get a chance later. Let me point out that when the decision to go into production with the E.M.2 in isolation was declared by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) on 25th April, 1951, at that time the problem of finding a common type of ammunition had not been solved and the British pattern rifle had not been devised, as it now has been, to take the ·300 round. Therefore, I asserted—this is the only reason I am speaking in this debate—that such policy was a great mistake, but I do not impute any evil motives to the right hon. Gentleman, and I am glad to feel with Pope that: 
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);33;:As I say, the fact remains that the right hon. Gentleman very authoritatively adhered to the ·280 round at the time when no arrangements for production of a common round had been made.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);33;:All I say is that a vote was taken after the trials, and notwithstanding the vote, which I have described, the British representatives decided to adopt the ·280 round and go ahead alone.

Notwithstanding the fact that that was the opinion of the different countries at the Conference, it was decided to go on with the ·280 round and to go ahead alone. This was a grave decision, and such was the position which we found when we came into office.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);28;:Yes, Sir. Various modifications were thereafter incorporated in the Belgian rifle, and, in 1953, it was subjected to further tests, when it was judged to meet our requirements.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);46;On a point of order. I demand an apology for that extremely discourteous remark. To say that a Minister dealing with a highly technical and complicated question and endeavouring to give the House information is deliberately falsifying his statements is, I think, unparliamentary in its character.

1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);56;The conclusion reached in 1951 by the British Trials Board was that the Belgian F.N. was  technically the most efficient on the score of dependability, functioning and accuracy. Various modifications were thereafter incorporated in the Belgian rifle, and, in 1953, it was subjected to further tests, and was then judged, in 1953, to meet our requirements.

It has been quite a frequent event to happen with Governments that offices are changed during their continuance. I accepted this advice, which was given to me through the regular channels without any initiation by me, in my dilatory condition, as the hon. Member opposite said, after studying the papers and arguments submitted. The policy received  final Cabinet approval on 1st December last. I gave the House, in answer to a Question on 19th January, the main reasons for that decision.

I see nothing invidious or insulting in speaking of the length of time that people have carried a rifle. Certainly not. I do not feel at all ashamed to say that the F.N. is a more soldierly weapon on the march and is more suited for use in manual exercises—[Hon. Members: "Ah!"]—which hon. Members opposite mock at, but which are very important for discipline and morale. I am assured that it is also easier to teach soldiers how to use this rifle, and that is important in these days of short service. Last, but not least, I repeat what hon. Gentlemen opposite so foolishly mock at, that the F.N. is a better weapon both with the bayonet and with the butt and is capable of giving confidence to a soldier in a mêlée.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);56;As hon. Gentlemen on that side of the House are always looking round in every controversy, even in this one about rifles, to try to find  fault with the Americans, I suppose if I were to say that the Americans had accepted it, the hon.

The descendant of Paget's "Examen" will, I hope, be very careful and precise in his facts, and be careful in not misrepresenting and misquoting and otherwise defaming other people. He was a great defender of my ancestor.

I have ventured to put this point, that people ought not to be brought up to execution, or believe that they are to be executed, time after time whether innocent or guilty, however it may be, whatever their crime. That is a wrong thing, and I trust we shall have an opportunity  of testifying in that matter before an irrevocable act is committed.

1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;70;Hon. Members must give me a moment to get up; I am perfectly prepared to answer. This matter was, naturally, very fully discussed, but I say again that this is a matter for agreement. The general conclusion was that this was the best appointment. I cannot at the moment say whether there was an elaborate discussion or not, but in any international organisation of this kind, of a number of—
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;30;In an organisation of a number of countries, it is not possible for one country to insist on its right to some particular office. It is a matter for discussion.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;55;It was possible, anyhow, not very long ago, for one country to sink 525 German U-boats compared with 174 by the United States.

As the hon. Member for Attercliffe (Mr. J. Hynd) has said, on the land we welcomed General Eisenhower; the Americans alone have the atomic bomb, which covers a great part of the air, but  here, in this question which is absolutely vital to this island, will he not ask them to give it further consideration? I am only asking that the Prime Minister should believe that they are very ready to treat loyal Allies with all fairness and generosity.

I am well aware of the difficulties of clock time and sun time throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations—and I do not say that they have been satisfactorily solved on this occasion,—which seem to assign to London and Great Britain 2 a.m. as the moment of release for an important declaration. One would think this might be a matter for further consideration on future occasions. But I am all the more glad that His Majesty's Government have met the request which I made to them with the full support of my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Liberal Party, that the joint declaration of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers should be reported formally to the House and thus take its place not merely—or, perhaps, I ought to say, not only—in the newspapers, but in our Parliamentary records. Any other course, I feel, would be derogatory to Parliament and especially to the Mother of Parliaments.
1949-4-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-28;India (Commonwealth Relations);43;I should like to put this point. It seems to me that, far from being any derogation of the Monarchy, the proof of the attachment and importance that all the Dominions gives to it has shown the strength and vitality of that institution.

1940-11-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-11-05;British Prisoners Of War;199;His Majesty's Government have had this whole matter under review. Responsibility for the despatch of parcels to British prisoners of war has, by arrangement with the Government, been undertaken by the war organisation of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John. The influence and usefulness of the Society are largely due to its independence of Government control, and its relationship with the International Red Cross at Geneva rests on that basis. In these circumstances to appoint a member of the Government to the Council of the Society, as suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend would, in the view of the Government, be likely to defeat the very objects which he has in mind. As regards Questions in this House, various Government Departments have responsibilities in connection with prisoners of war, and I think it is desirable that Parliamentary Questions should be addressed to the Ministers responsible for those Departments. I have, however, arranged that, in order to meet the convenience of the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War will answer any Questions raising general issues relating to prisoners of war which are not specifically the concern of another Service Department.

1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);66;We all sympathise with the right hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Gentleman was terribly worried—[An HON. MEMBER: "He was ill."] I know, and he was worried. I remember very well Mr. Pybus wanting to resign and he was attacked by the hon. Members for Croydon, East (Sir H. Williams) and Torquay (Mr. C. Williams). It is a kind of ritual with the Conservative Party to sacrifice.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);49;The hon. Member does not quite realise that his right hon. Friend's orders are to deal with housing. I am dealing with the fact that there is nobody else in the House to deal with business. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not get the point correctly.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);35;May I remind the right hon. Gentleman that only a few weeks ago we were on the debate on the Queen's Speech. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to cover the ground we amply covered then.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);152;I should have thought that, in view of the interval that has occurred, the right hon. Gentleman might well have thought of some variants to the general indictment which we all remember he threw upon us then. I am quite sure the right hon. Gentleman did his best, and he had every reason to do his best. We shall have the opportunity of seeing how this works out before we get to the end of the day. I should like to look back a little on the course of events in order rightly to judge this Motion on the Paper. On Tuesday last we were expecting a strong, vigorous debate upon the Steel Bill. At the end of Questions, when we were about to take this important discussion, the Adjournment of the House was moved about a tragic incident in Kenya, and, after some vehement discussion, this was permitted by Mr. Speaker.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);172;I am only discussing this particular episode in Kenya in order to draw the attention of the House to what actually happened before the proceedings on Tuesday night. I am giving the House my own feelings at the time. When there is such a state of affairs as in Kenya, I thought myself that, if there were a debate and Division on this matter, we might rupture and break the nerve of these young people, and we might well find that great disasters and bloodshed would follow. Not only might there be a massacre, but the whole structure of Government might be weakened. All the settlers throughout this scattered country would be in mortal peril. [Interruption.] Hon. Members opposite will give me credit for not being afraid of interruptions or noise. It even would be much easier to be shouted down continually or booed down, because I have not the slightest doubt I could obtain publicity for any remarks I wish to make, even if they are not audible in the House.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);12;I am certainly not making any reflection at all upon the Chair.

It is quite true that he has to get the leave of the House, but it is Mr. Speaker who says whether it is a matter of definite urgent public importance. That is a Ruling as to the nature of the subject.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);106;I hope I shall be allowed a measure of free speech. I thought it was perfectly understood that the Chair interpreted the rules of the House. Those who put these rules into motion, and those who, when opportunity is given to them, cry for action—they are the ones who take the actual responsibility. And it is to them, and to them  alone, the word "wanton" applies. I have got a lot to say, and I shall have to keep the House several hours if we go on at this rate. Nothing will induce me to be frustrated in unfolding the argument—not even sham points of order.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);99;Rarely have I seen such a change of mood in the House. The Oppostion Members trooped out in all directions, and a quiet, half empty House was left to listen to the debate on a Measure which, we were told, was such a flagrant example of reactionary legislation. Nothing could more clearly vindicate the Government in allocating only two days to the debate on the Second Reading of the Iron and Steel Bill than the lack of interest—and, I may say, of argumentative power—shown throughout the proceedings by the Opposition. [Interruption.] I am going through what happened on Tuesday.

1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);65;There was—[Interruption.] I remain wholly unaffected by this discourtesy and interruption, because  I know that nothing can possibly do more harm to hon. Gentlemen opposite than shouting down, and breaking down if they can by repeated interruption, the Minister who is responding to an official Motion of censure. Do not, I beg of them, imagine that this distresses me, except by contemplation of their conduct.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);116;I am telling the House what happened. It was due to the contrast between the stormy debate about Kenya and the apathy on the Iron and Steel Bill. As I said, this is not an excuse. It is, however, an honest explanation of the error we made in thinking that all faction was over for the night. I am confessing quite plainly that we were in error. But what was the conduct of the Opposition? Only four of their Members were present at the time—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—only four of their Members were present—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] The Opposition must not be afraid of argument; do not be afraid of what is coming; brace yourselves to bear it.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);49;I have already said that we regret that we did not keep a quorum. I have already explained that the reason was that after the other debate on Kenya had been concluded there was—[Interruption.] Well, if hon. Gentlemen opposite will not listen I will not interrupt my own speech.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);49;I will be perfectly frank with the House. I was better employed in sound slumber on that occasion. I was, of course, paired. If I had not  taken some of these precautions I should not have sufficient strength to sustain the ordeal to which I am now being subjected.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);30;That is a tempting subject—the Gas Bill. The right hon. Gentleman has given great study to it, which he will no doubt benefit by now that he is in opposition.

Friends behind me but trying to throw rebukes upon those who are in the wrong this afternoon. It seems to me that it is quite clear that with this process of a handful of Members, unable and unwilling to divide the House, nevertheless delaying the whole process of legislation, they could produce a situation different from any which has hitherto confronted Parliament.

1951-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-14;(Government Policy);122;I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way to me for a moment. The reason we have not felt entirely comfortable about what he has said is that he is always saying, "We have doubled this; we have doubled that," without our knowing what "this" is. He says that we have made a 40 per cent. increase. On what? On x, and so on. Now he used two phrases, that there would be a considerable improvement and that there would be really large-scale production; but none of these things has anything definite in it. He must excuse a certain amount of scepticism and doubt where there is no foundation given, no datum line from which the multiplication takes place.
1951-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-14;(Government Policy);4;What does that mean?
1951-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-14;(Government Policy);53;The right hon. Gentleman said something about the conditions at the beginning of the last war.

1947-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-29;Distilling (Barley Allocation);36;Is it not the case that the price of a bottle of whisky exported to America to gain dollars is five shillings, or something like that, and that here it is about five times as much?
1943-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-22;Armed Forces (Saluting In Streets);36;No, Sir.

The general figure of 170,000 evacuated from London would have no effect other than to disappoint the enemy, who would have expected more. A very great deal of this matter can be talked about. There are, however, particular points you do not want to talk about, and most people can see those points for themselves.

1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;132;I hope the right hon. Gentleman realises that I am anxious to rescue him from the very uncomfortable and invidious position in which he lies in the meanwhile when he appears to be denying that each representative of Great Britain shall be free to speak and vote as he or she thinks fit at any meeting of the Consultative Assembly; and, secondly, that the British representatives at the first Consultative Assembly should reflect the relative strength of the political forces in the House of Commons and should be appointed from Members of both Houses by a Resolution of this House. The point I am going to put is whether the right hon. Gentleman can afford indefinitely to go on denying, or appearing to deny, recognition to these obvious democratic truths and principles?
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;64;The right hon. Gentleman is founding his question on assumptions that he chooses to make. I have neither affirmed nor denied any of these propositions; I have merely informed him that it is usual to wait until a constitution has been formed and agreed upon before taking action. That is all there is to it. The right hon. Gentleman jumps off before the pistol.

They should have been near the position by about 10 a.m. this morning. A further signal was received from the Master of the ''Athenia'' at about 1 a.m. this morning stating that there were 1,400 passengers, some of whom were still on board, and that the ship was sinking fast.
1939-9-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-04;Torpedoing Of Steamship "Athenia";76;I need scarcely say that the utmost endeavours will be used to employ all our means of escorts to their fullest possible capacity, and to adopt such other methods as may be necessary for vessels which fall outside the class and cannot at this moment be convoyed. We have every belief that the convoy system will be brought into complete operation at a comparatively early date. In the meanwhile all that is possible is being done.

1939-9-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-04;Torpedoing Of Steamship "Athenia";55;It certainly was torpedoed without the slightest warning, in circumstances which the whole opinion of the world after the late War, in which Germany concurred, stigmatised as inhumane. According to my present information—I must confess that I have not had any opportunity of confirming it precisely—the ship was not in any way an auxiliary cruiser.

When two nations are fighting together under long and solemn alliance against a common foe, one of them may be stricken down and overwhelmed, and may be forced to ask its Ally to release it from its obligations. But the least that could be expected was that the French Government, in abandoning the conflict and leaving its whole weight to fall upon Great Britain and the British Empire, would have been careful not to inflict needless injury upon their faithful comrade, in whose final victory the sole chance of French freedom lay, and lies.

A large number of survivors have been picked up by destroyers and merchant ships, amounting in all to 687 officers and men. The Commanding Officer, Captain Makeig-Jones, went down with his ship.

1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;6;I was quoting the Minister himself.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;264;My right hon. Friend does not deny that he made merry. The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence is not, of course, an executive officer, but a co-ordinating officer, and, in fact, his staff does not consist merely of his personal assistants, but it is to be found in the whole machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence. I think probably most hon. Members are of opinion that my right hon. Friend has performed invaluable services in the work of supply. He is not, of course, the Minister who places contracts, but he has a great work to do in allotting priority of orders among the three Services, and of making sure that their programmes are kept in proper balance and not thrown out by deficiencies in one section or another. He has, then, in that direction performed invaluable services. But after watching his activities closely, I feel that I can with complete confidence give the House an assurance that the original object which we had in mind in appointing him has been achieved. Co-ordination, which already even before his appointment did exist, has been greatly strengthened and improved. The system of control, which has been described on a previous occasion, is working smoothly and efficiently. As hon. Members know, it is based upon the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which the Prime Minister is Chairman, and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence is Vice-Chairman. He is responsible, on behalf of the Prime Minister, for the supervision and control of the whole  of the organisation and activities of the Committee of Imperial Defence.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;105;I do not propose to enter into details in this opening statement. I have no doubt that in the course of the Debate a great number of questions will be asked by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, and there will be an opportunity, before the Debate closes, for a reply by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence. That will be the time for the hon. Gentleman to get answers to such questions as should be answered, and it is not now desirable that I should interrupt the general statement I was going to make by going into matters of detail.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;72;It proceeds on the assumption that the Government have changed their policy, and, in particular, have abandoned the League of Nations. I, on the contrary, claim that I am a  better friend of the League than some of those who speak of it. The League to-day is mutilated; it is halt and maimed; and those who, like myself, do their best to build it up afresh to be a real world League—
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;190;—which could protect the weak and limit the powers of the strong, serve it better than those who would attempt to put on it in its present state tasks which are manifestly beyond its strength. What is, in fact, meant by this phrase that peace can be attained only through collective security under the League of Nations? We have never said that in no conceivable circumstances could collective security under the Covenant be provided, but I ask what small country in Europe to-day, if it be threatened by a larger one, can safely rely on the League alone to protect it against invasion? I challenge hon. Members opposite to answer that question. There can be only one honest answer to it, and that is "none," although a small nation may have powerful friends who will act as its guardians and protectors, and so preserve the peace. If that be so, why should we try to persuade small nations that they can rely on peace where there is no peace? Why should we mislead them by giving them an assurance of security when any such security can be only a delusion?
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;249;There is no foundation for the charge. But I have to deal with a world in which dictatorships exist. I have no interest in other forms of government, except in so far as they react on other countries. I have no bias in favour of Nazism, Fascism or Bolshevism, because all of them seem to me to be inconsistent with what is all-important to me, because it is the root of my political creed, and that is individual liberty. No sensible man will ask that liberty, even the liberty of the individual, should be completely unfettered. That would merely be to allow one individual to gratify his own selfishness at the expense of others. But subject to reasonable restrictions, I believe in liberty of thought, of speech, of action. Without that there  can be no true democracy. I do not believe that a democracy need necessarily be less efficient than other systems of government. It may, indeed, sometimes lag behind in time in making its decisions, but, at any rate, democracy can do what no dictator can permit himself; democracy can afford to make mistakes. For the preservation of democracy, which means the preservation of our liberty, I myself would fight, and I believe that the people of this country would fight. I am convinced in the innermost core of my mind that the course we are pursuing in putting forward our present programme for Defence is the surest way of avoiding the grave necessity of fighting at all.

1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;163;The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) is, I am sure, entitled to the compliments of the House for his maiden speech. Not only did we sympathise with him in those internal tremors which are so often the prelude to excellent preformance both in this House and in the field, but the House, I think on all sides, will have felt that we may look forward in the future to contributions from him to our Debates of a sensible, solid and practical character. I shall not attempt to follow the hon. Gentleman into the topics which he specially selected, though I think he was quite well-advised to speak to us for the first time on subjects which he had studied particularly and of which he had had special experience. I do not wish to be drawn into details on this occasion, neither do I feel very much inclined to discuss those rather fearsome Amendments  by which it is sought to overlay this Debate.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;15;I never suggested it myself. My right hon. Friend is doing an injustice to me.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;206;The last thing in the world I should wish to do would be to repay an injustice by an injustice, and least of all when probably there is no foundation for either. But I did imagine that he put it that those who had asked for a Ministry of Munitions had, so to speak, wished completely to absorb the whole industry of the country on munitions. If there had been a  Ministry of Supply, plans could have been made upon a nation-wide scale as other countries are doing, and there would have been no need for the successive afterthoughts and readjustments following from short and partial views. Those afterthoughts have marred the whole of this period. The Government refused to create a Ministry of Supply, but the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, intended for quite a different purpose, has laboured hard to do the work. We are told, also, that he has done all his other work, too. I hope so, and, if so, he deserves cordial thanks and most unstinted admiration, because the tasks which he had to do seemed to go beyond the capacity of any human being that we know of alive to-day, or even read about in the more expansive days.

Keyes) made a very interesting contribution to the Debate, and I was particularly interested in his quotation from his correspondent in Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, that correspondent was apparently unaware of the Prime Minister's declaration that henceforward the small nations could not look to the League for any support. I am grateful to the hon. and gallant Member because he has brought the Debate back to the subject of Defence. In March, 1936, Mr. Baldwin, as he then was, said:

1940-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-7-30;Secret Session;290;A week ago the Government were led to believe that there was a desire in the House to have a Debate about foreign affairs, and that it was the wish of the House for it to take place in secret, so that Members of all parties could say what they really felt about foreign countries without any danger of adding to the number of those countries with which we are at present at war. It is always the desire and also the duty of the Government, so far as possible, to meet the wishes of the House, and arrangements were accordingly made for this afternoon. However, it appears that some of the newspapers prefer that the Debate should take place in public, and we are assured that secrecy is undemocratic, especially in times of war, that it would be wrong for Members of Parliament to have privileges in matters of information not enjoyed by the whole mass of the nation, and that the Government should take the nation and the enemy fully into their confidence and let the whole world see plainly exactly how and where they stand in relation to all other countries in the present critical juncture. These arguments, or others like them, seem to have made an impression in various quarters of the House, and the Government are now in the embarrassing position of a servant receiving contradictory orders from those whom their only desire is to serve. We therefore have found means to give the House an opportunity of expressing by Debate and Division, the opinion whether the Debate should be secret or public. Also we have arranged that this preliminary Debate can itself take place under conditions of the fullest publicity. I conclude by moving, 
1946-7-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-10;Foreign Commercial Broadcasts;37;Are we then to understand that the British public are free to listen to anything they like, and anything they can, but that the Government will exercise restraining force on what is allowed to reach their ears?

1944-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-4-21;Empire And Commonwealth Unity;326;When we planned this Debate together through the usual channels, it was well understood that its main purpose was to enable the House to express its opinion, and that the Government would have no far-reaching declaration of policy to make. Indeed, it has been everywhere recognised that for us to commit ourselves to hard-and-fast lines of policy, or even to the advocacy of particular suggestions or proposals, would not be appropriate on the eve of the first meeting we have been able to arrange—after, I can assure the hon. Member for Eye (Mr. Granville), many attempts—of all the Dominion Prime Ministers since the war began. Thus viewed, I think it will be almost universally admitted that the Debate has been a great success, and has been of far-reaching usefulness; that the Motion on which the Debate is founded is acceptable to all; that there is, as the Noble Lord has said, an all-party agreement on most fundamentals; and that the level of the discussion has been worthy of the breadth of the subject, and has been distinguished by speeches of a statesmanlike character, for I can use no other word for speeches such as I heard yesterday from my hon. Friend the Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell), and to-day from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Devonport (Mr. HoreBelisha) and the Noble Lord the Member for Horsham and Worthing (Earl Winterton)—although, after the very kind compliment the Noble Lord has just paid me, I was not quite sure whether I had not better leave him out. I must regret that I could not hear all the speeches which have been made, but I sat up till half past two this morning reading the full report of every speech, and I crave the indulgence of the House for not having been constantly on the Bench during this Debate, on account of some other things which, hon. Members may know, it is my duty to look after.
1944-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-4-21;Empire And Commonwealth Unity;183;—which certainly does not, whatever else may be thought about it, reveal me as a very ardent supporter of those policies, and certainly makes it very odd that I should have, for the time being, the honour of leading the Conservative Party. I have no intention of passing my remaining years in explaining or withdrawing anything I have said in the past, still less in apologising for it; but what I am concerned to do is to show to the House, and also to Members of my own Party, how strictly I have, during my stewardship, safeguarded the structure of Imperial Preference, which has arisen out of the controversies and achievements of the last 40 years, against any danger of being swept away in the tumult of this war. At my first meeting with the President of the United States, at Argenta in Newfoundland, at the time of the so-called Atlantic Charter and before the United States had entered the war—a meeting of very anxious and critical importance—I asked for the insertion of the following words which can be read in that document:

No one would be more content than myself to see the whole story unfolded. I  pressed this matter several times since the war, during the period when previous Governments were in power.

1952-11-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-11-27;Atomic Energy (British Scientists' Achievements);71;Yes, Sir, I think that is perfectly true, and some day the full history of the British contribution to those formidable and terrible events, which is a great one, will be made public. It is quite true we could not make the bomb over here during the war because we were under bombardment, but we made a great contribution and I do not think full consideration has been given to that.

Members, but no doubt the House will desire that I should make a statement on the subject. The result of the meeting at Berchtesgaden on 12th February between the German and Austrian Chancellors was stated by the former to be an extension of the framework of the July, 1936, Agreement. Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen will recollect that that Agreement provided, among other things, for the recognition of the independence of Austria by Germany and the recognition by Austria of the fact that she was a German State. Therefore, whatever the results of the Berchtesgaden meeting were, it is clear that the agreement reached was on the basis of the independence of Austria.
1938-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-14;Foreign Affairs (Austria);212;The Prime Minister has detailed to us the event in this very serious time, and in his closing words he has put before us very grave considerations. This has been for all of us a week-end of great strain, and I fully appreciate the need on this occasion, on every occasion, to speak with the utmost restraint and with a full sense of responsibility. We are face to face with events grave in themselves, which may lead us far to still graver events. We have first of all to see the passing, or what looks like the passing, of a great historic State, Austria. For the last two decades Austria has survived in a truncated condition and during the last decade has been a pawn in the rivalries of great Powers. She has not been a free agent. Her Government has been influenced now by the dictator of Italy, now by the dictator of Germany. She has been pulled now by one and now by the other of these two great Powers, and she has been torn, too, by rival emotions. On the one side the people have a natural affinity with their fellow Germans across the frontier. On the other hand they had the desire to preserve their great cultural heritage.

Lady the Member for Jarrow (Miss Wilkinson) with which I felt myself in much more cordial agreement than some of my neighbours did. There were other things in her speech with which I found myself much less in agreement. But I do not propose to trench upon any of the controversial or party or recriminatory grounds which enter into many people's minds, and which might well be exploited upon suitable occasions but seem inappropriate to the grave circumstances in which this Debate is held. The speech of the Prime Minister overshadowed the Debate and dominates all our minds. I do not know when in my lengthening experience of the House of Commons I have heard—certainly not since the War—a statement so momentous, expressed in language of rigid restraint but giving the feeling of iron determination behind it.

I stated my position perfectly clearly. What I was envisaging was the position of the world to-day and the question of whether now was not the time to try to draw together all the peace-loving States. I never advocated the use of force at this moment.

May I draw your attention, Sir Charles, to a flagrant and obstinate breach of the rules and regulations of the House by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) who for a number of minutes stood stationary, and also draw your attention to the grave injury and danger that might arise if hon. Members took the opportunity of Divisions to stand about in fixed positions on the Floor of the House, whereby they might obstruct the movement of other hon.

There will be a British war medal which will be given over the whole area, but I cannot attempt to make any pledge in the matter. The question of the issue of this widely distributed medal will be one we can take up when the war is over.

My difficulty is that I do not feel that he has bridged the gulf between the awe-inspiring facts which he mentioned and the practical method of solving them by the Motion—moderate, and certainly well-intentioned—which he has placed upon the Paper.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;65;We must not forget, moreover, that no one has more interest in being right in this particular matter than the people of the United States, who have the greatest need to take all precautions, since the Marshall Islands are much nearer to them than to us, or indeed to most other nations. My own impression is that this biological aspect tends to be greatly exaggerated.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;153;I have never seen much which the hon. Member was able to rise above. I do not really see why I should be blamed. When, after the Election in 1945, I quitted the office of Prime Minister which I had held during the war, our position was very different. I feel that it will be in the national interest, and can do nothing but good on both sides of the Atlantic, if I now make public for the first time the agreement which I made in 1943 with President Roosevelt, which was signed by both of us at Quebec. President Eisenhower has informed me that he is content that I should do so. The House will find this document in the Vote Office when I sit down. I thought it right to lay the facsimile before the House, but here are the salient facts. I wrote them out myself those many years ago. 
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;45;I do not understand the right hon. Gentleman saying that we abandoned any precautions. We did not abandon any of these agreements; we carried them on with the United States Government. Unfortunately, the Senate passed the MacMahon Act, which prevented them carrying out those agreements.

Gentleman to whom.! alluded, that I hope he will be specially helpful now, in consequence of what happened. I do not say that there were not many reasons and facts operative at the end of the war which were different from those during its course, but considering that the abandonment of our claim to be consulted and informed as an equal was the act of the Socialist Administration—
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;65;I must ask the Prime Minister on what grounds he says we abandoned any claim. We did not abandon the claim; we made the claim, and I believe that the United States Administration were fully prepared to carry it out. They were prevented by the action of the Senate, which passed the MacMahon Act, which prevented them giving the information. We did not abandon anything.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;51;They abandoned the agreement, or took action which enabled the agreement to be destroyed. [Interruption] Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite must not show so  much uneasiness in the matter. I feel they have no ground for reproaching their successors with the consequences. [HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw."] I have nothing to withdraw.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;129;I am coming to that aspect a little later, but I will transpose what I have to say to meet the wish of the House. I return to the Quebec Agreement as a whole—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]. Why do not hon. Gentlemen opposite listen? Why do they say "No," especially when they do not know what I am coming to? When I visited the United States two years ago, I showed this document that will soon be in the Vote Office to Senator MacMahon, whom I had known for some time, and who was a man of the highest honour and outstanding patriotism to his own country. [An HON. MEMBER: "So is McCarthy."] He said at once, "If we had seen this agreement there would have been no MacMahon Act."
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;164;I regret that the Prime Minister made an attack on me in this matter. I never reproached him with any  of the terms of the Quebec Agreement with regard to the industrial side of it. The right hon. Gentleman said that we had abandoned it. He now tells me that Senator MacMahon did not know of the Quebec Agreement. Surely, that is not a reproach on me. If it is a reproach on anybody it is on the United States Administration. The right hon. Gentleman will remember that I did not go by myself. I went with Lord Waverley to try to settle these matters. We had an agreement with the Administration, and we were informed they could not carry it out because of the Senatorial action in the MacMahon Act. Surely it was not for me to send the MacMahon Committee or Senator MacMahon this information? If the right hon. Gentleman is making any attack, he is making it on the Truman Administration.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;52;I did not intend —[HON. MEMBERS: "What? Did not intend what?"] I did not intend—[Interruption.] I have no doubt whatever that before the MacMahon Act was passed he ought to have confronted the people of the United States with the declaration. That is what I believe will be the view of history.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;94;I did. I made reference to it in a former Parliament. I hesitated to make a public disclosure as a private person, but I did communicate with Mr. Truman on the subject, and he strongly appealed to me not to do so—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—but I frequently urged the right hon. Gentleman to make this agreement public. This matter can be looked into and debated at length, but I am quite certain that if the agreement which I made had been made public, it is very unlikely we should have had facilities withdrawn from us.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;54;I am of opinion that the agreement should have been circulated in confidential circles in the first instance to the American Government. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] The war was over, and there was no reason at all why this solemn agreement, signed by President Roosevelt and me, should not have been brought into proper consideration—
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;4;—by the American Government.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;44;What possible reason had I to suspect that the United States Government, with a Bill affecting an agreement like this with us, had not informed their own supporters and Senator MacMahon? I did not know. They did not tell me. How could I know?
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;25;I think it would have been an obvious precaution to confront them with that agreement. [HON. MEMBERS: "Resign."] Anyhow, they were not confronted with it—
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;30;I do not see what all this anger is due to if it is not through a feeling of considerable regret that other action was not taken at the time.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;114;The right hon. Gentleman said that I referred to the quid pro quo which was given in the new agreement—namely, giving up the right to commercial and industrial production. It can, of course, be said that in the fourth article of my agreement with President Roosevelt I abandoned all rights to the control of industrial and  commercial nuclear power and left them entirely to the President of the United States. He was to act in accordance with what he considered was fair and just and in accordance with the welfare of the world; whereas the Socialist Government regained these rights in return for sacrifices in the share of the control of the military aspects.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;77;The right hon. Gentleman now says that we abandoned control over the military in exchange for advantages on the industrial side. We never had advantages on the industrial side. There was no bargain of that sort. I think it is a pity in this debate that all the time the right hon. Gentleman is attacking us for not developing atomic energy. I never mentioned the Quebec Agreement and giving away the industrial advantages. I was too loyal.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;30;As for the commercial, that has now, after 11 years, been offered to the whole world by President Eisenhower's proposals made in the address to U.N.O. on 8th December last.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;40;In these proposals not only are knowledge and rights in the commercial sphere freely extended, but even what is thought to be an increasing proportion of the nuclear stockpile is to be transferred from war destruction to peace and plenty,
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;18;I therefore still feel that I was right in the choice which I made on the commercial aspect.

Nothing could be more disastrous to peace than a grave dispute—[An HON. MEMBER: "You have started it."]—between Britain and the United States. I have not started it at all.

1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;16;Yesterday, the hon. Member for Coventry, East (Mr. Crossman) wrote in one of the Sunday papers:

If the United States withdrew from Europe altogether— she might withdraw from Europe altogether—and with her three-quarter circle of hydrogen bases already spread around the globe, she would face Russia alone, as she certainly could.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;70;We never got much out of that. We did get agreement for close co-operation and working. I should like  to say to the right hon. Gentleman—I do not want to go into the question of negotiations with the American Government —that he knows the difficulty where an agreement has been made by the President and it has subsequently come to the knowledge of the Senate, who have not been consulted.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;51;That was done with full discussion between the Administrations, and when I went over there in 1945, the results of our talks were published. There is, however, this point. This was a particular personal agreement with a President who is now deceased, and we had to deal with a successor Government.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;59;I was attacked by the Prime Minister, and it was suggested that I had bartered all kinds of safeguards for no advantage at all. The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that the President has not got a treaty -making power in the United States, but that there is the Senate, and he knows the difficulties that arise there.

1937-7-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-19;Supply;140;We are indebted to the Secretary of State for having treated us this afternoon, very appropriately, considering the circumstances of the Debate, to a comprehensive review of the more critical aspects of foreign relations all over the world, and the official spokesman of the Opposition has followed with no less expansiveness and with very careful and painstaking attention to many details. I notice that the only difference between the outlook of the two Front Benches is that whereas my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs says that the outlook is not entirely black, my feeling after listening to the hon. Member on the Front Opposition Bench is that on the whole the outlook is rather grey. I shall not attempt to emulate either the Government or the Opposition in taking so wide a view this afternoon.

Resistance to Communism and to a Communist revolution—that is the point made by the hon. Member for Bridgeton—is not a class issue. Everyone knows that in a Communist or Bolshevist revolution what are called the upper classes, the nobility, the landowners, the financiers, the manufacturers, the clergy, the bourgeoisie, and the bulk of the intelligentsia, are destroyed. They do not last very long, there is not enough  of them to go round, and the really successful Communist revolution, once that provender has been used up, begins killing the ordinary working classes, and I have no doubt that you could show that hundreds of ordinary weekly wage-earners have perished in Russia in the revolution for everyone of those classes I have mentioned. After they have begun killing the working classes they, of course, at the same time start killing each other, a process which I am bound to say I have always been able to contemplate with a fairly steady eye.
1937-7-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-19;Supply;117;The figure was somewhat picturesque. It arises from the idea of a large and heavy body responding rhythmically to the movement of the waves. To go on like that would be exactly the same as letting capital ships anchor over a minefield, of which some foreign Power on shore held the key. Some finger—Bolshevik, Anarchist, Nazi, Fascist, I know not which, for the purpose of which I care not—might press the electric button, and an event might occur which might seriously alter the balance of sea-power throughout the world. Let hon. Members mark this, if such an event did happen, it would not be the end, but only the beginning of a tragic chapter in human history.

Gentleman that there is nothing snobbish, only that "Euphrates," as the right hon. Gentleman pronounced it, I am bound to say to my ears is an unusual pronunciation.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);82;I expect that the right hon. Gentleman wishes that he had such cordial relations with his own back benchers. It would have been strange for the Government to have sold a destroyer to any Power outside the Atlantic Pact at this time, when anti-submarine vessels are regarded as top priority in our shipbuilding programme. But to have given one to Egypt in the circumstance and at this moment is, I think—I appeal to the ordinary unprejudiced common sense of the House—quite inexcusable.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);42;Not at all. The hon. Gentleman has been on all sides in this particular question.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);30;All right. I think that was a very foolish thing to do, but it was done in the period of the war when, naturally, arms got loose in different directions.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);65;The question is whether the right hon. Gentleman is adopting the right course or not. At any rate, the course which he has adopted, as I shall presently show and have to some extent shown, has certainly not led to the conclusion which the right hon.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);4;That is quite untrue.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);25;The Prime Minister may hold a very different view, but he cannot dismiss an argument or even an assertion by muttering, "Quite untrue, quite untrue."
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);75;I was trying to correct the right hon. Gentleman on a point of fact. It is quite true that my right hon. Friend was ill, but he was an effective Foreign Minister throughout. It may well have shortened his life, but it is quite untrue to say that Mr. Bevin ever let his hand go off the Foreign Office. Anybody in close contact with him knows that that is not in accordance with the facts.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);63;That, of course, is a matter of opinion, but I adhere strongly to my statement. I fully admit that the Prime Minister had opportunities of closer study of what was actually taking place, but, anyhow, he is directly and personally responsible for allowing the Foreign Office to be without effective guidance during all this critical and, as it may well prove, costly time.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);30;Because I do not wish to inflame or detain the House. I have already given those two reasons, and it did not require any "why not" from the hon. Gentleman.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);82;If there is any urgent need which the Government feel for stronger military preparation, I can only remind them that they have always received our support in all major things that concern the national safety. But the  giving and promising of our support to such measures of security and preparation is quite different from, and has no relation to, the urging upon the Executive of definite military operations. For these, the initiative and sole responsibility fall upon the Government of the day.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);82;But this I must say in conclusion. If the Government so manage this affair as to lead in the end to the total evacuation of the British oil personnel from the Abadan refinery, it will be our duty to challenge them here and in the country by every means in our power. The issue between us—which I trust may not arise—is the total evacuation, in any circumstances which are at present foreseeable, of the Abadan refinery by the nucleus of British personnel.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);12;I thought the hon. Gentleman was turning on his right hon. Friend.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);9;The hon. Gentleman wanted to have it both ways.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);121;I welcome very much the note that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bromley (Mr. H. Macmillan) struck in the conclusion of his speech. I wish that he had opened this debate, or that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) had been here to do so, because I cannot think that his substitute struck the kind of note that was needed in a serious discussion of these matters. We had instead a speech punctuated all through by the cheapest of jibes against the Government and against Members of the Government, and not even sparing a late Member of the Government who is dead. The right hon. Gentleman, I think, might have left that alone.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);24;I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that it would be a great and agreeable change from what I have to look at now.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);25;Before the right hon. Gentleman can be sure of that, he had better get a periscope and watch them when next he makes a speech.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);95;I am now dealing with a matter in which I know the noble Lord is particularly interested. I am dealing with Palestine, on which I should like to see the noble Lord march together with his Leader. The one chance that I thought we might have had of settling the Palestine question before it became so exacerbated was in the war-time Coalition Government. It was very unfortunate that the right hon. Gentleman did not take up the matter then, because there would have been a great chance, I think, of getting agreement on the matter.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);11;Is the Prime Minister talking about me or the noble Lord?
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);165;Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman said that it was an impression of weakness that we gave. That was quite wrong, because we were not weak. There is a very sedulous propaganda to try to show that we are weak everywhere. I was struck by the speech of the hon. Member for Lancaster (Mr. F. Maclean), for whose writings I have  a great admiration; but his was a most surprising speech which seemed to ignore everything that has been happening in the world. He seemed to think that somehow or other we could have maintained enormous forces, for they were enormous forces, in the Middle East and everywhere else, and he seemed to think that that was the policy put forward by the Opposition. It was never so. The Opposition always realised the limitations on the possibilities of what we could do in arms, and it is well known that we have been endeavouring all the time to build up our strength in the Middle East.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);3;War-time sterling balances.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);133;Yes, war-time sterling balances. That was not a matter peculiar to Egypt. It was a fact that these heavy balances were piled up. I dare say that some of these payments were far too large for the services rendered. But the House must remember that these were delayed payments for things and services that we utilised in the war. It may be that we ought to have made a better bargain, but no action was taken during the time of the war-time Government to warn these  people and tell them that we would not pay these balances. There was no decision that this obligation would not be honoured. There was no decision by the Government. I know the right hon. Gentleman talked about it very often but a monologue is not a decision.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);11;The quotation which I made was from a speech in 1947.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);21;And the right hon. Gentleman was able to interject his "Yes, Sir," in the monologue of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);109;The right hon. Gentleman is a little previous. I am still in 1944–45. I am coming on to 1947 and to the next point. Of course, we should all have liked to scale these balances down, but we could not do it just by arbitrary action. We could only seek agreement, and that is precisely what we did. We sought agreement; we were unable to get that agreement. It is perfectly well understood. The right hon. Gentleman talked about United States loans and the rest of it. We agreed we would do our best to scale down the balances, but we never suggested there should be a unilateral repudiation.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);15;I think we should have a discussion in the House before ratification; I quite agree.

Was not the payment made quite simply by crossing out something of these sterling balances?
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);93;That is quite possible. Obviously, it is not much good releasing to people their sterling balances if they cannot buy anything with them. The right hon. Gentleman is like Mr. Bultitude who said to his son, "What is. the good of half a crown to you? You will only spend it." We base our rights in Egypt on the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. and so long as we do this we have to honour our own obligations under the  Treaty, one of which is to facilitate the supply of arms to the Egyptians.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);39;And the plant. This seems to me to be really what we wish to bring under this rather general phrase of nationalisation. At the present moment we are accepting that principle. The details will have to be worked out.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);42;I think the statement made was perfectly clear on that. There may have to be a withdrawal from the oil wells and there may have to be a withdrawal from some part of Abadan, but our intention is not to evacuate entirely.

1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;12;I said this week, but I did not mention any particular day.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;313;I think that, perhaps, it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene at this stage and make what contribution I can to the Debate this afternoon. It has been observed that this is the last occasion on which we shall have a Debate upon foreign affairs before hon. Members go away for the Recess, and certainly one cannot deny that at the present moment there is more than one centre of unrest, and no doubt the House would like to have some information from me. In the position like that at the present time when we are conducting a number of negotiations with foreign Powers, some of them of a highly delicate character, I feel, at  any rate, that it is an occasion when one should be careful what one says, and, in particular, that one should not seek to exaggerate any differences that there might be between us. I cannot say that I think that either of the two speeches to which we have just listened are very successful illustrations of that national unity to which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness (Sir A. Sinclair) is never tired of repeating that I am the only obstacle. There is a curious difference of view between the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton). The right hon. Gentleman thinks that unless I endorse in firm and unmistakable terms a speech made by the Foreign Secretary, it must be assumed that I do not agree with him. On the other hand, the hon. Member opposite paints a picture of a Foreign Secretary in chains; he has no mind of his own, but can only say what is put into his mouth by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. These two views may be said to cancel each other out.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;130;Why is the hon. Member now making it the subject of his complaint? I cannot follow the hon. Member in all his inconsistencies. The hon. Member and the right hon. Gentleman opposite both devoted a large part of their speeches to the negotiations with Russia. Both of them suggested, though they did not actually say so, that the delay in coming to an agreement was entirely the fault of this Government. I do not know whether the French Government were also included. Both of them said that they had been kept in the dark, although the hon. Member opposite afterwards professed to give a time-table, I think he called it, of the negotiations to illustrate his thesis that the delay had all been on the side of the British Government.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;197;I know that the right hon. Gentleman said that, but he said it in such a way as to convey the impression, the deliberate impression, that though he did not seek to allocate the blame, meaning to say that he could not prove it, he wished the House to understand that the blame did lie, and lie entirely, with the Government. The hon. Member opposite has been very proud of his persistence in asking questions about the course of these negotiations for a long period of time, and, in fact, he has tried for a long time to goad me into recriminations against the Soviet Government by seeking to put the blame for the delay upon this Government. If I have restrained myself, if I have refused to enter into discussion as to the differences which prevented the completion of the agreement between ourselves and the Soviet Government, if I have done that all this time, that is the measure of the sincerity of my desire to come to an agreement. I can assure the Committee that it has required some self-control to abstain from refuting the false impressions which the hon. Gentleman has sought to convey.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;10;We did that in regard to France before the War.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;191;Yes, but the conditions were very different. Here is a country which is a long way off and with which we had not had close relations for a very long time. We are showing a great amount of trust and a really strong intention to bring these negotiations to a successful issue when we can agree to send our sailors, soldiers and airmen to Russia to discuss how we can make our military plans together before we have an  assurance that we shall yet be able to come to an agreement upon political matters. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the course of conversation, expressed the view that if we once begun these military conversations, to which he attached very great importance, the political difficulties should not prove insuperable. It was that expression of view which weighed with us in taking this very unusual decision, and it certainly is the sincere hope of the French Government and ourselves that this anticipation of M. Molotov will be realised and that we shall find it possible to agree not only in substance but also in form upon the remaining outstanding political difficulties. 
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;70;The right hon. Gentleman says that I made an attack on him. I did not begin the attack. As he has attempted to excuse himself, may I say that he seems to me to take up every rumour which is damaging to the Government, without committing himself specifically to it, and to give it as much publicity as he possibly can. It encourages foreigners to repeat it without its qualifications. 
1949-2-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-2-17;Official Report (Mr Speaker's Ruling);24;May I ask you, Sir, whether you have anything to add to the statement which you made yesterday concerning HANSARD and the OFFICIAL REPORT?
1949-2-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-2-17;Official Report (Mr Speaker's Ruling);49;Your explanation, Mr. Speaker, makes matters very clear. I should like to say we all have great confidence in HANSARD. Its early publication is an immense convenience to Members, who are glad that there is, as it were, a further check, in case large questions of law are involved.
1943-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-10-28;House Of Commons Rebuilding;4;I beg to move, 
1943-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-28;House Of Commons Rebuilding;239;I think I might be allowed to proceed. I shall not be very long, and then perhaps my hon. Friend can make his own speech. His Majesty's Government are most anxious and are indeed resolved to ask the House to adhere firmly in principle to the structure and characteristics of the House of Commons we have known, and I do not doubt that that is the wish of the great majority of the Members in this the second longest Parliament of our history. If challenged, we must take issue upon that by the customary Parliamentary method of Debate followed by a Division. The question of Divisions again relates very directly to the structure of the House of Commons. We must look forward to periods when Divisions will be much more frequent than they are now. Many of us have seen 20 or 30 in a single Parliamentary Sitting, and in the Lobbies of the Chamber which Hitler shattered we had facilities and conveniences far exceeding those which we are able to enjoy in this lordly abode. I am, therefore, proposing in the name of His Majesty's Government that we decide to rebuild the House of Commons on its old foundations, which are intact, and in principle within its old dimensions, and that we utilise so far as possible its shattered walls. That is also the most cheap and expeditious method we could pursue to provide ourselves with a habitation.
1943-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-28;House Of Commons Rebuilding;326;—and so, when I speak of rebuilding the House of Commons in 18 months, it is, of course, without panelling or carving, which can be added as the years pass by. It is simply a Chamber for us to dwell in and conduct our Business as we require to do. The timber must be set aside now if it is to be properly seasoned. The Clipsham Quarry, from which the stone was procured for the maintenance and replacement of the Houses of Parliament, is temporarily closed. It would have to be reopened. We must then consider very carefully the strain upon our labour  resources. The First Commissioner informs me that for the first six months after the plan has been started, after the word "Go" has been given, only 46 quarrymen and demolition men would be required, of which half would be over 40 years of age and the other half over 50 years of age. In the second six months 185 men would be required over 40 and an equal number over 50. But of those over 50 years of age 60 would be masons, whose trade has so little work at the present time. In the third six months—and we shall be getting on by then—we shall require 170 men, not additional, over 40 and an equal number over 50. All the 170 over 50 would come from the building trade; the 170 over 40 and under 50 would come from the engineering trade. This last is a much more serious consideration. But there is no need for us, even when the whole scheme is approved and the work has begun, to commit ourselves to the rate of reconstruction. We can fit it in as a stand-by job. It might well be that in a year's time, when we require men from the engineering trade, our affairs might be in such a posture that we should be looking for jobs rather than for men.

1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;7;May I answer the first one now?
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;36;Every effort is made to what I might call dovetail these arrangements and to utilise labour not immediately needed for defence purposes for the export trade, but there are some gaps which cannot be immediately filled.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;151;In regard to the second of the three questions which the right hon. Gentleman has put to me, it is a fact that, if the three-year re-armament programme drawn up by the late Government had been carried through in full, considerably heavier Estimates would have to be met by Parliament than those which we shall now present. One of the important causes of that is, of course, the rise in prices, but it is not the only cause. The cause is that, as production gets on the move, there is an acceleration and expansion, and very often things are achieved on a somewhat larger scale at an earlier moment than perhaps was estimated for; but, broadly speaking, if we had gone on with that programme which we found on arriving in office, there would have been considerably heavier expenses to meet, and it might have affected the balance of payments adversely.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;59;I am not sure of that. I do not think there can be any debate on this before Christmas, but when the White Paper is produced we come into the whole process of examination of Estimates, and not only of Estimates of the Defence Vote, which carries with it the general discussion of the whole field of public defence.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;86;No, I could not do so in detail without notice; I would not be able to remember at this moment. But sometimes it is better to slow down the production of weapons which are being superseded by newer and better types in order to be more ahead a little later on. The fact that we have felt able to do that indicates, on the whole, that we do not think that the worst emergencies with which we might be faced have approached any nearer to us.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;68;These are difficult questions to answer on the spur of the moment. The original £4,700 million programme carried with it three years of maintenance. Now it is spread over four years, and we have advanced in time, so  it is spread over four, and, in part over five years in which there are new maintenance charges running each year, and, in addition, there is the rise in prices.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;57;I think I said some time ago that it would be £5,300 million at the value then prevailing, but it is more than that now, and if we take a fourth year it may be well over £6,000 million. I do not think we can be reproached with not taking a serious view of the financial aspect.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;170;No, Sir. As I have said, we always guard ourselves upon the point of solvency and capacity to produce, because these estimates were originally produced to meet a great emergency. It had to be done very quickly indeed, but now it comes home in much more detail. As far as manpower is concerned, I can undertake that we shall not call up a single man who is not absolutely necessary for the discharge of our obligations, but I think that at this critical juncture above all others, for Great Britain, if we, instead of setting an example as far as we can in terms of service to the Continental Powers, were to make a violent reduction in our manpower or in our terms of service, the result could not be estimated merely by any reduction in our own strength. It might bring about an almost complete collapse of the great organisation which grew up under the previous Administration and for which its  leading Members have the responsibility and the credit.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;86;Oddly enough, and without further investigation, I should imagine it would be the Admiralty itself. It always used to be. All these matters will require and deserve the searching attention of the House next year when the Estimates are presented for each of the Service Departments. Also, I can say now that, once the White Paper has been laid, be shall be anxious to afford the fullest facility for a debate on the subject which, however one looks at it, ought to be a non-party affair.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;25;Certainly. They are actually engaged in combat in both those theatres, and obviously they have the first claim on the supply of munitions of war.

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;33;On a point of Order. I wish to ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether you can give us any guidance as to the scope of the Debate on the Motion of the Prime Minister?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;124;I submit that the terms of that Motion were set down before this incident arose, that they were taken over by the Prime Minister, that it is entirely concerned with the Official Secrets Acts, that it was not set up to consider the position of a Member of this House who is summoned before a Court of Inquiry or a military Court, that it is to inquire into the action of Ministers with reference to the proceedings under the Official Secrets Acts, but that that was under consideration by this House before this  incident arose. Therefore, that Motion had not this particular action of the Secretary of State for War and the Army Council and the Court of Inquiry in mind at the time.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;5;The terms of reference mentioned 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;56;May I argue further on your Ruling? I take it that I am right in assuming that we are entitled to debate the report of the Committee of Privileges and everything contained in that report, and that the contrary opinion may be expressed and sustained from any quarter of the House. For instance, take this sentence: 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;117;With great respect, and apologising for pressing this point, which is of some importance, I will ask you this: Might not the fact that the Committee of Privileges makes no reflection on the Military Court be due to the fact that the Secretary of State has accepted responsibility, and would it not be proper to state that in the Debate, as showing the reasons why the Select Committee did not make, or might be assumed not to have made, any reflection on the Military Court? Are not questions of reflection on the Military Court and matters connected with the reasons why they did not make a reflection, arguable matter, and germane to the discussion of the Report?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;98;Surely it is open to this House to consider the report of the Committee of Privileges, and if you say that the report of that Committee puts the blame on the Court of Inquiry, is it not open to someone to urge in this House that the Committee puts the blame wrongly, and that it should have put it on the Secretary of State for War for setting up this Court of Inquiry, knowing that proceedings were taking place in this  House? Is not that point arguable by a Member on the report of the Committee of Privileges?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;43;Did I understand you to say, and did I hear you aright in saying, that the report of the Committee of Privileges put the blame upon the Military Court of Inquiry?

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;6;Without making any reflection on them.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;145;Are you not making an assumption that every Member might not necessarily make, that when once that Military Court was set up the Minister had no power to stop it, interfere with it or influence it? Is not that a question which can be discussed in this House? There is nothing in this report that lays down that when once the Court is set up the Secretary of State cannot interfere with it. We do not know whether he did interfere, but it is arguable that he might have interfered with it, and I am putting it to you that in discussing this report of the Committee of Privileges we are entitled to discuss it freely, and that there should not be any limitation by assuming  that the Secretary of State or the Military Court did something which is not contained actually in this report.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;36;Is it not an assumption to say that the Secretary of State's interference ended with the setting up of the Military Court? We have no evidence that he did or did not; we do not know.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;4;We know he did.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;63;We do know, as a matter of fact, that when the Committee of Privileges was set up the right hon. Gentleman took action to stop the Military Court sitting. You are assuming necessarily that because that Court was set up the Secretary of State's interference ended. I am asking you whether there is anything in this report to give grounds for that assumption?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;10;With respect to you, Sir, it says just the contrary.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;297;It is, of course, a fact that the House may not choose to agree with the report of the Committee of Privileges, but, nevertheless, I am sanguine enough to hope that they will not take that course. The report of the committee was short; it dealt with only a single incident; and it was unanimous; and I have not seen or heard any criticism of the conclusion at which the committee arrived. It might, perhaps, be thought, from this general approval, that the committee had had an easy task, and that their conclusion was foregone. I would like to tell the House that the matter was not so simple as that. I do not know whether the Select Committee over which my right hon. Friend the Member for the Pollok Division of Glasgow (Sir J. Gilmour) is presiding will find themselves in a position to lay down any general principle as to the extent of, or as to the limitations upon, the privilege of Members of this House; but, whether they do or not, in the meantime it is the case, as is pointed out in the report, that there is no formal authoritative statement about privilege to which reference can be made and by reference to which judgment can easily be pronounced as to whether a certain action is or is not a breach of Privilege. That being so, the committee sought guidance from the pages of Erskine May, and also from the knowledge and experience of the Gentlemen at the Table. Erskine May is not very definite about the question of Privilege, but there is one passage which the committee had before them and which is important in this connection. It occurs on page 73, and I will read it to the House. It says: 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;31;I will say suggested—[HON. MEMBERS: "By whom?"] At any rate, it was a matter of question. I am not judging the question; I am trying to give an entirely objective account.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;263;I do not want to enter into a controversy. I withdraw the statement, so far as my hon. Friend is concerned. I would rather put it this way, that action had been taken with the result that it was alleged that a breach of the Official Secrets Act had been committed. My hon. Friend must be presumed to have taken his action in the interests—or what he conceived to be the interests—of the State. The House, having had information upon this matter, proceeded subsequently to set up a Committee to investigate the circumstances of the case. A military court had also been set up, and, although the purpose for which the court had been set up was a different one, although they were approaching the subject from a different angle and in regard to a different individual, yet the incident to which the proceedings had reference was the same as that which formed the subject of inquiry by the Select Committee. Before the Committee of Privileges had reached its conclusions the question of any clash between this military court and the House of Commons had ceased to be of any practical importance, because the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry had been adjourned until after the Report of the Select Committee had been made. Nevertheless, that did not seem to be any reason why the Committee should not make their recommendations in accordance with the terms of reference to them. The Committee reported, in the words which I am going to read again, because they are the important part of the Committee's Report: 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;236;On a point of Order. May I submit to you that there were three  statements by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys)? The first was on 27th June, which was a Monday, and the matters arising out of that are the matters that are referred to the Select Committee according to the Motion by the Prime Minister on the day when he set up the Select Committee. But subsequent to that there was on 29th June a further statement by the hon. Member for Norwood, in which he said that he had been summoned to appear before a military court of inquiry, and it was on that second statement that the Committee of Privileges was set up, and the matter referred to the Select Committee is the questions that were raised by the hon. Member for Norwood's statement on 27th June, which contained no reference at all to the military Court of Inquiry, because at that time he had not been summoned to attend before it and may not even have known that it was set up. I submit, therefore—and I wanted to catch your eye when you gave your previous Ruling —that this question of the military Court of Inquiry is not among the matters submitted to the Select Committee, because they are directed to inquire into the statement of 27th June, which contains no reference at all to the military Court of Inquiry.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;137;I would like to submit that you have ruled that this matter of the setting up of the Court of Inquiry is one of those matters which will be inquired into by the Select Committee. It forms part of their reference. The Select Committee is appointed to inquire into the substance of a statement made on 27th June by the hon. Member for Norwood and the actions of the Ministers concerned. I take it the Ministers were concerned in the matter in that particular complaint and any subsequent complaint, and what I want to make sure of is that  if we are ruled out from raising the matter in this House we shall not be subsequently ruled out on the Select Committee by a statement that the matter arose on something which took place after 27th June
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;210;I came to the House this afternoon not at all expecting that any controversial matter would be introduced into our discussion. I am still disposed to make a very few observations, mainly of a laudatory character on our Ministers, our institutions and, generally, on the way in which this Privilege affair—I am keeping very strictly within the limits of the topics that we can discuss—has been conducted. Except in one respect, which I shall come to later on, which has newly dawned upon my conscience, I am in hearty accord with the Report of the Committee of Privileges, which I understand it is in order for us to debate. I feel that we owe a debt to our chairman, the Prime Minister, for having led us unanimously to this conclusion. The technical grounds of this breach of Privilege are clear. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) has pointed them out. A Member of this House while preoccupied with the duty to attend before a Select Committee, of which the Prime Minister had already given notice, was summoned to appear before an inferior court upon the same subject or upon matters cognate to that subject. He was, therefore, in a Parliamentary sense obstructed in the performance of his Parliamentary duties.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;236;That was not a case where officers set themselves against the authorities, they resigned their commissions, but I should be straying rather far from the narrow path along which I have to progress if I attempted to deal fully with that matter, although I am quite capable of discussing it in detail. But military questions, obviously of the highest consequence, are raised in view of the fact that it appears that this Court is alone responsible for its action and that there is not responsibility higher than this Court. I shall not press any further upon this subject, though I feel astonished that we have not had an appeal to the Chair by the Secretary of State for War to be allowed, almost as a personal matter, to stand between this subordinate Court and the censure which is now directed upon it. Every instinct would have prompted him to spring up and say not merely "I take the full responsibility" in the technical sense, but to say it precisely that these officers were obeying the orders of a higher authority in everything they did. The blame does not rest upon them but on those who have told us that they accept responsibility for their action. That is all I wish to say on this particular subject which I might, indeed, have illuminated a little further but for the conditions under which we are discussing the matter.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;49;I was under the impression that, in signing this Report, I was casting no reflection on the Military Court, but I have heard from you, Sir, that the Report puts blame on the Military Court.

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;49;Since the hon. Member puts that question to me, I am ready to answer it. The meaning I attached to it was that the Military Court had committed a technical offence, but that it was not considered that they had deliberately attempted to challenge the authority of the House.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;5;I did not say so.

I should have thought that the Adjutant-General, in the ordinary course, would have said to the Secretary of State for War, "This matter is taking its course, but in view of what happened in the House of Commons yesterday, ought it not to be suspended?" If the Adjutant-General had not said that, then the Secretary of State himself ought to have said, "In view of what happened in the  House of Commons yesterday, obviously this court must be delayed." That is what would have happened, according to my experience.

This Debate deals specifically with the Report of the Committee of Privileges; that is what we are discussing naw; and certainly I myself, when I heard that it was proposed to insert these words exonerating the military Court, naturally came to the conclusion that it remained open to the House in debate to search further for the person upon whom the breach of privilege censure alighted.

Silverman) to withdraw the words which he had uttered applying to the hon. and gallant Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd)—[Interruption.] —I am content to wait.

Member for Nelson and Colne use the expression "offensive lie," I heard you ask him to withdraw, and I heard him very becomingly defer to your Ruling. What I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, is that my hon, and gallant Friend the Member for East Renfrew did not rest his case on the use of an offensive expression but upon a charge. Therefore, I ask you if you would discriminate in your Ruling between the duty of hon. Members to withdraw offensive expressions which they use, and to withdraw charges—[Interruption.]—I am not speaking to hon. Members opposite, but. to Mr. Speaker—and to withdraw charges which it is perhaps their duty to bring to the notice of the House of Commons.
1947-11-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-06;Public Appointments (Ministers' Recommendations);153;On a point of Order. We are now on the question of what is a Parliamentary expression and what is not. I was always brought up to believe that "lie" was an unparliamentary expression, but greater latitude has been given to that in late years. "Liar" is unparliamentary, but "lie" has often hitherto apparently been passed. The hon. Member below the Gangway, very properly, withdrew his expression at your request. Therefore, "offensive lie" has been regarded this afternoon as unparliamentary. I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, whether the expression "political nepotism" is unparliamentary. Is it wrong for the Opposition, or for any Member of the Opposition, or my hon. and gallant Friend, to put down a Motion on the Order Paper attacking the Government in which the expression "political nepotism" occurs? We must have the freedom of the use of language to describe the processes which are going on at the present time.

1939-9-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1939-9-26;U-Boat Warfare;267;The war at sea opened with some intensity. All our ships were going about the world in the ordinary way, when they were set upon by lurking U-boats, carefully posted beforehand. In the first week our losses in tonnage were half the weekly losses of the month of April, 1917, which was the peak year of U-boat attack in the late War. That was a very serious proportion. We immediately replied in three ways. First, we set in motion the convoy system. This could be very quickly done for all outgoing ships, but it took a fortnight to organise from the other end the convoys of homeward-bound ships. This system is now in full operation — in full operation both ways. Meanwhile, however, large numbers of ships which had started independently, under the ordinary conditions of peace, had day after day to run the gauntlet of the waiting U-boats with-  out being either armed or escorted, and in consequence a serious, though, I am glad to say, diminishing, toll was exacted. The convoy system is a good and well-tried defence against U-boat attack, but no one can pretend that it is a complete defence. Some degree of risk and a steady proportion of losses must be expected. There are also other forms of attack besides U-boats, attacks from surface craft and from the air, against which we must be on our guard. I can assure the House that every preparation is being made to cope with such attacks, but I must again warn the House that we cannot guarantee immunity and that we must expect further losses.
1939-9-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-26;U-Boat Warfare;104;But that is the great problem for us — to find destroyers for our many needs, many needs which I cannot mention to the House, which make great demands upon us. This hard stroke of war in no way diminishes our confidence in the methods now at our disposal. On the contrary, our confidence in them has grown with every day they have been employed, and I believe that their potency will become more apparent in proportion as the great numbers of new vessels come into action, and in proportion as our hunting officers get the knack of using depth charges by frequent practice.
1939-9-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-26;U-Boat Warfare;105;— where we were unlucky in losing some tankers, we have lost 60,000 tons in the first fortnight and gained 50,000 tons from the enemy, apart from the enormous additional stores we have brought safely in in the ordinary way. Again, I reiterate my caution against over-sanguine deductions. We have, however, in fact got more supplies in this country this afternoon than we should have had had no war been declared and no U-boat had come into action. It is not going beyond the limits of prudent statement if I say that at that rate it will take a long time to starve us out.

1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);331;The right hon. Gentleman will, I trust, agree with me in the general principle, that Members should have the freest possible right to put Questions on the Paper without prejudice to the undoubted right of Ministers to refuse to answer them if they consider the public interest is involved and if they are supported by the general feeling of the House? That is the only principle that I am wishing to assert. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, at the present time, whole blocks of very important topics, in which enormous numbers of people are interested and concerned, are ruled out because it is thought that Ministers do not wish to have those Questions answered, and because it is alleged that Ministers have no particular power over the nationalised industries in question, whereas, in the case of a good many of the industries that have been nationalised, specific powers have been retained by the Government both in regard to the securing of information from the industries and in regard to control over them? Will he bear this in mind, that there is no question at all of denying the ultimate right of a Minister to refuse to answer Questions provided he can carry with him the support of the House of Commons, but that there is grave objection to whole  classes of Questions being excluded even from being placed upon the Order Paper as a result of some Ministerial utterance? On the question of the Debate upon this subject, we gladly receive the right hon. Gentleman's assurance that conversations may take place with a view to fixing a date; but I must submit to him that this matter is not a party matter, that the Questions come from all parts of the House, that it concerns the Procedure of the House of Commons, and that, therefore, we consider most strongly that it rests with the Leader of the House to offer reasonable opportunity for this discussion in the Government's time.

For a great many years, Sir, I submit to you, there has grown up the custom that the Table—and we have the greatest respect for the manner in which the Clerks at the Table discharge their duties—have only refused, say, questions of a particular class affecting individuals, and reflecting sometimes upon them. This has grown up by custom of the House. But now, suddenly, a vast mass of topics—whole series of topics on vitally important business affecting millions of people—has come under this bar.
1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);25;Why does the right hon. Gentleman suppose that in the war the  Minister of Information "got away with it "—to use his own colloquial expression?
1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);201;Was that not because he was supported by the majority of the House of Commons? Is that not the right foundation on which Ministers can rely for the endorsement of their discretionary powers as to whether or not they should answer a Question? If Parliament, by a majority, supports them, and if it is the general feeling, no one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and feelings—[Interruption.] Just listen. No one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and the majority of the House in these matters. But with regard to putting a Question on the Paper, surely the presumption should be that any Question may be put on the Paper unless barred by those long customs of good taste and non-assailment of individuals, which have been accepted by the House for generations. The presumption is that anybody may put a Question on the Paper. Does the right hon. Gentleman not realise that we are not objecting at all to the power of the Government, supported by the House of Commons, to refuse to answer Questions? What we are criticising is the institution of an arbitrary and mechanical bar to the placing of those Questions on the Paper.

Gentleman might like to follow the Leader of the Opposition. It appears that, in the mood in which the Opposition find themselves, they prefer that I should speak at once, and I am quite ready to satisfy them in that respect. On the whole, I think the right hon. Gentleman made a speech which was perhaps less bitter and less intemperate than I had expected. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I do not know why, but it was, although there were in it a good many rather paltry sneers. Of course it is pretty obvious that on this matter hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have very deep and strong feelings, and in these circumstances it is perhaps rather difficult to get a patient hearing for the voice of reason. [Interruption.] The right hon. Gentleman says that there  is no reason, but, at any rate, there are attempts at reason. The other day I was very much interrupted, and certainly had not a very good chance of pursuing a connected argument. I do not know whether I shall be any more fortunate this evening, but, whatever the result, I ask hon. Members in all parts of the House to remember that they too have their responsibilities, as well as Members of the Government, and that, when they are touching on subjects which may bring us near to that dangerous borderline which divides peace from war, we ought all to remember those responsibilities, and ought not merely to look at the circumstances of the moment, but to think also of the possible consequences of any action that we may take to the lives and fortunes of our fellow-countrymen. Great indignation has been expressed by Members of the Opposition at the attacks upon British ships and at the destruction of British property—a matter on which they have not always shown such enthusiasm. They should ask themselves in this matter whether their motives are entirely unmixed, and whether it is solely indignation at the destruction of British property or the risk to British lives that has moved them in this matter. From the very beginning of the Spanish conflict, the Opposition have offered the most persistent and sometimes embittered opposition to the whole policy of non-intervention—
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;24;That is perfectly wrong. The policy of non-intervention was accepted by the Labour movement until it was shown that it was absolutely one-sided. [Interruption.]
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;281;I was saying that the Opposition have from the beginning opposed the policy of non-intervention. The right hon. Gentleman says that that  is not so, and that there was a period during which they accepted it. All I can say is that it was very short, and, as time has gone on, they have made it clear that they object to the policy of nonintervention for the simple reason that their policy would be a policy of intervention. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] They cannot help viewing every question and every incident as it arises from this angle: "Does it or does it not help the side in which we are interested?" The right hon. Gentleman professed once again that he did not know what the policy of the Government was. We have made it, I think, sufficiently plain to ordinary people that our governing motive in this matter is not a preconceived feeling in favour of one side or the other. [An HON. MEMBER: "Ask Lennox-Boyd."] Our policy has been to try to preserve the greatest of British interests, namely, peace, and, all through, the object of the non-intervention policy has been to avoid what we conceive to be the inevitable result of intervention, namely, an extension of the conflict beyond the shores of Spain until it became a general European conflagration. That has been our aim all through. The right hon. Gentleman opposite said that it is his aim, too. Then all of us, since we have that aim in common, should take care that we are not diverted from that aim by any provocation, whether it comes from the benches opposite or whether it comes from attacks on British ships.

Others disregarded the warning; and there were others, again, who were attracted by the high freights which are always associated with trade of that kind to enter into this trade. I do not know whether hon. Members happened to notice an article in the "Daily Herald" a little while ago, in which a considerable amount of space was devoted to the exploits of a certain Jack Albert Billmeir, who was described as the world's newest king. This is what it said: 
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;16;That is the description in the "Daily Herald." I do not know that it is witty.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;20;Wit is so often on the lips of the hon. Member that perhaps I may be forgiven. The article concludes:

1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;205;—or take action which might conceivably involve us in war in order to give protection to people like this, who have gone, for purposes of making profits, into this risky trade, in spite of the warnings of His Majesty's Government. There have been, since the war began, a number of British subjects who have been themselves engaged in hostilities on one side or the other. Some have not been engaged in hostilities at all, but they have been engaged in medical work or ambulance work, which is very necessary for military operations, if it is not a military operation itself, just as supplies of coal or wheat or oil are necessary to maintain military operations although they are not military operations themselves. In pursuit of this work, these men that I speak of have run risks, not for profit—they went to fight for principles in which they believed so intensely that they actually decided to go and strike a blow for them themselves—a very honourable thing. Many of them have been killed, but I have not heard any protest from the other side, or any of these demands that the British Government should involve the British people in the risk of war on their behalf.

I say that that is the way to start a new European war.  That is the view of the country in general. We have the responsibility—it does not now rest on the right hon. Gentleman—and we are not going to take the risk. I want to know whether the right hon. Gentleman is advocating the bombing of aerodromes in Majorca or not?
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;89;I have to take these things on information given by the Government. The Government have told us that these are entirely Franco planes. When the Prime Minister wants to deal with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) he says that they are Italian planes and that that might involve us in the risk of war. He cannot have it both ways. If he will make a plain statement and put his cards on the table I will tell him what we would do.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;50;If there is any doubt I will attempt to clarify my statement. It remains to be seen whether the right hon. Gentleman will follow that up by putting his cards on the table. He says that he would not go to war with Italy, but that he would with Franco.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;93;I never said anything of the sort. I will tell the right hon. Gentleman. There is a risk of a general war. I pointed out that, if as a matter of fact this was merely General Franco, there could not be a risk of a general war; and I have stated my opinion that the blockading of Majorca—because aeroplanes, after all, have to have oil, and there is no oil in Majorca—would be an effective measure to stop this bombing. I do not believe that General Franco would declare war on Great Britain.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;163;I am satisfied from that statement that the right hon. Gentleman is prepared to take warlike action against General Franco in the sure belief that it would stop there. Can any responsible Member of this House think that it is safe to rely upon such a hypothesis as that? In the course of the Debate on Tuesday last I listened with great interest to a speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys), in the course of which he examined very carefully a possible course of action. He asked that his proposals should be considered sympathetically, and I must say I thought that that was not an unreasonable request, put forward in the way that they were and in view of the  arguments which my hon. Friend used. What did my hon. Friend wish to do? He said that he did not propose that we should bomb areodromes in Majorca, but he did wish that we should not exclude retaliation.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;314;Well, reprisals. I do not distinguish between the two. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] If there is a distinction, let us call it reprisals. He agreed that it was not possible to take serious exception to the case of a ship lying alongside a wharf which could not easily be distinguished by an aeroplane flying at a great height from the adjoining town. In the case of ships lying away from the wharves, in the roads or in the harbours, if a deliberate attack was made, and especially where machine gunning was employed, then, he said, action could be taken. What was the action that he proposed? "I will demand compensation not at the end of the war, but now." That could be done, of course. But supposing compensation were refused or not paid, we are back again in the old difficulty, and my hon. Friend quite saw that, because he said emphatically that he would have us resort to reprisals. That is to me the most interesting part of his speech, because I wondered whether there were reprisals which he had in mind which had not occurred to the Government, and he suggested reprisals of one of two kinds—either the seizing of a ship belonging to General Franco, or the impounding of property belonging to General Franco whether in the form of goods, or money, or securities. I am glad that he did not include in his reprisals the suggestion that we should send a warship to bombard a port in the possession of General Franco. That was the form of reprisal which was adopted by the Germans after their battleship was bombed, but the criticism made upon it at the time was that it was punishing the wrong people, and that is the criticism which we should make on similar action being taken to-day by whomsoever it was taken. Therefore, that is ruled out.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;232;It is, therefore, perfectly obvious that it would be very easy for General Franco to retaliate in kind to a greater extent than our original action, and we should be forced back again to the old position. Of course, it is always in our power to take action. We are a strong Power and General Franco is a weak one, and if we were prepared to use our force against Franco, then that would be a different matter altogether. But then we are back again in the same dilemma. If we started warlike action, whether it were against General Franco or against some objective of which the ownership was doubtful, who could tell that we could stop our operations there, and it might be the beginning of another European war. The British Government have always made a distinction between attacks on British ships which might be called accidental inasmuch as the ships were near some military objective and that a hostile aeroplane, aiming at that military objective, might unwittingly involve a British ship in the attack—we make a distinction between that kind of attack and an attack deliberately aimed at a British vessel. There have been a number of cases, as I stated on a previous occasion, when all the evidence seemed to us to make it clear that those attacks were deliberate. In such cases we have made the strongest protests—
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;165;—and we have, of course, reserved our right to compensation. But, on the other hand, General Franco has in the most emphatic terms denied to us that he ever had any intention of deliberately attacking British ships, and that such action—[interruption].Perhaps I may be allowed to  make my statement. Hon. Members opposite really cannot expect to have uninterrupted opportunities of speaking if they are going to continue in this way. The Burgos authorities have stated that any such action would be entirely inconsistent with their desire, which they have often affirmed, to maintain friendly relations with His Majesty's Government. It may be remembered that in my statement on the 13th of this month I said, what was quite obvious, that it was impossible that attacks, frequently involving loss of life and sometimes apparently deliberate, on British ships, could be repeated without serious injury to the friendly relations which the Burgos authorities said they wished to have with us. I should like to repeat that warning.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;21;I should like the right hon. Gentleman to explain in more detail his proposal in regard to anti-aircraft guns for ships.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;54;I have made no proposal. I did not make any proposal  in regard to anti-aircraft guns, I said that was a matter for the owners and not for the Government. If the right hon. Gentleman is asking whether the British Government are prepared to issue arms to merchant vessels, the answer is, definitely, no.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;36;That is not the point. The hon. and gallant Member for Clitheroe (Sir W. Brass) asked whether these ships could be provided with them, and the right hon. Gentleman said, no, they must provide them themselves.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;9;I said it was a matter for the owners.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;13;Are the Government going to give any facilities, having thrown out that suggestion?
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;149;No, I am not sure that the right hon. Gentleman did not put his finger on the important point when he asked whether it was possible, in view of the non-intervention arrangement, for these vessels to arm. I am endeavouring to sum up the position of the Government, and I say once again that we are not going to change the policy which we have announced to the House and the country with regard to Spain. We believe that that is the right and proper course in the best interests of the country. We believe that that is the course the country desires us to take. We believe that if British ships still continue to go into territorial waters for the purpose of making these high profits, they must take the risk and they must not seek to throw upon others responsibilities which we are not willing to undertake.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;202;I should always differ from my hon. Friend the Member for the neighbouring division of South-East Essex (Mr. Raikes) with much reluctance, because my hon. Friend and I have cooperated and collaborated in other Parliaments and on other topics, and it certainly could not be suggested of him that he does not form his own opinions irrespective of party pressure, or even of constituency pressure. He forms his own opinions, and he gives his counsel truly as he conceives it to be his duty to do. Therefore, I differ from him not only with personal reluctance but, on general grounds, with some anxiety. Nevertheless I do not think that my hon. Friend was well advised to point to the recent by-election as a sign that the people of this country were entirely upon the side of the foreign policy of which we are having another example to-day. If he would examine those by-elections carefully he would, I think, see that it would be better not to cite them as evidence of popular opinion, but in any case I do not think this matter, which is so very grave, should be settled by reference to the fortuitous incidents and accidents of by-election contests.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);139;The right hon. Gentle man is very prudent in not endeavouring to inform us of the actual words, which he undoubtedly did use, and which were of so sanguine a nature as to give the impression that he was jumping at office like a dog at a bone. "Five million houses in quick time," was the promise of the Foreign Secretary. Let us see what progress there is to report. Until the German war was over and the builders were released, no Government could have produced any substantial number of completed permanent houses. We should, however, have expected to see by now signs of permanent house building start-  ing up on an appreciable scale through out the country, whereas, as every one knows, it is still a very rare event to see a permanent house in course of construction.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);200;The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition opened today on a quiet note of injured innocence. We were the people, according to him, who had driven this public-spirited Opposition into putting down a Motion of Censure, we were the people who had driven a wedge between the parties in the State. I have not forgotten the right hon. Gentleman's broadcast at the beginning of the Election, nor have the people of this country.  That was when any partisan tone was introduced, and I have also had the plea sure of reading the right hon. Gentleman's speech the other day to his party. It was a very different style of speech from that which we have had this after noon. The burden of the right hon. Gentleman's speech is this: He said: Why, when you were elected to carry out a Socialist programme, did you not carry out a Conservative programme? To the right hon. Gentleman everything that is Conservative is normal, anything that sees a changing world and wishes to change it must be wrong. We are always asked to rally round, to be patriotic and keep things as they are. We were not returned for that purpose.

I am pointing out to the House that at the present we are doing better, very much better, 12,000 against 10,000, than what he said he did. What was the position at the end of the last war?
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);9;I think I was responsible for the Army alone.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);189;I do not think so. The men there were much more easily brought across. They were only just across on the Continent. The difficulties of shipping were nothing like what they are today. I claim, therefore, that this is very largely a stunt. In the same way, Class B releases were difficult. The right hon. Gentleman found at the end of the last war how difficult it is to have special releases for special men without upsetting the rest. We have been working on that principle, the application of which has been improved. The right hon. Gentleman rather sneered that we had managed to alter things. After all, we have to watch events and see how they move, shipping changes and the like. There has been a constant acceleration of the demobilisation programme; it has been stepped up, and it is being stepped up again today. In the same way, Class B releases were largely held back through the unwillingness of the men to accept it, but conditions have now been made better, and the releases are actually today between 10 percent. and 15 percent. of the Class A.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);142;:It is difficult to answer in a few words. There is great difference in the situation now and the one which we had after the last war. After the last war we had no people East of Suez, but we had great problems too in one sphere. What has come to be a great difficulty in the present situation is that we have a comparatively small number of men far off beyond Suez in the East, and that is holding up an otherwise perfectly normal rate of discharge which would be possible in all the other theatres. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] The new question is, how far is it possible to release those from the nearer theatres— [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer "]—and how long must great numbers be kept waiting about, because of the great difficulty of releasing a very few from the distance?
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);101;:The right hon. Gentleman has pointed out that conditions have changed, because the Japanese war has come to an end, but this position, which was adopted by the late Government, was under the general idea that the Japanese war would continue and that you would have people there and you would have people at home; yet that position was strongly put by the right hon. Gentleman about the morale of the men, and that we must maintain it. Believe me, the need for keeping up the morale of men who are scattered all over Asia and elsewhere is just as strong.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);7;It is all a question of proportion.

We have scoured the place for ships. We have managed to speed it up. The right hon. Gentle man knows that demobilisation is not just a question of pulling out men here and there. You have to think of the efficiency of the units when rapidly taking away all the older men and all the rest of it. I do not need to tell the right hon. Gentle man that it is not an easy process and therefore people should not talk lightly about it.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);285;Yes—by setting free at an early date millions of men and women now kept in unemployment. I should like to know whether there is any basis for that figure. Any one can say ££ 800,000,000, or even £1,600,000,000, but where does it come from? Was it given to him by the distinguished physicist who supplies him with economic information? I would ask whether, in rendering that figure, he has taken into account all the additional expenditure which arises on the  termination of a war. Let us look at the facts. Demobilisation charges do not stop directly men are demobilised. There is leave of eight weeks, plus foreign service leave, during which they draw pay and allowances. They are paid their war gratuities. Does he want to cut that off, out of the £800,000,000? This is actually an increase in expenditure, and for the Army alone this amounts to£100,000,000 in the current year. You cannot escape that. As regards munitions, despite substantial progress payments, when a con tract is terminated, arrears of payment fall due, and that is a very large item. Then we have the cost of a very large haul of prisoners—he has forgotten that. There is requisitioned property, which when vacated involves heavy compensation. There is Lend-Lease, which ceased at the end of the war. For food alone there is an additional charge of £150,000,000, as the direct consequence of the termination of hostilities. This is not all, as the right hon. Gentleman said, paying people for doing nothing. They are putting up houses and factories in the development areas, for returning Servicemen. All those things are of the nature of capital investment by the community. I dare say these were not noticed.

But I will not pursue that subject further.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);104;Oh, yes, foreign intervention as regards Spain. We are foreigners in regard to Spain. We have had the same policy followed out. If you look at the outline of the proposals you will find, on page 4 of the White Paper, that the system of supervision on the land frontier will be restored at once—the land frontier which we have kept all the time against the Spanish Government. It is admitted that for a long time General Franco has had the stronger force at sea; in fact, opening the sea and closing the land has made all the time in favour of General Franco.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);30;I do not think any hon. Member on the other side will disagree with me when I say that General Franco has not managed to raise a great national army.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);175;Let us look at the other side. The Spanish Government have been deprived of their arms and of their arsenals. They had very scanty munitions and very few skilled instructors, but the fighting has been kept up for more than a year, and there are now very large armies —trained and organised armies. I take those facts not from one side or  the other. They are very fine armies, up to the number of hundreds of thousands capable of taking the field. I claim that if General Franco had been able to raise enough Spanish forces to fight, he would not have wanted to be indebted to Germany and Italy for troops. The Spaniards would not like to have their battles fought by somebody else. Therefore the continued importations of foreign troops and the continued calls for more are pretty fair indications that General Franco has not the support of the people of Spain, even in the parts which are under his authority. It is obvious that without this foreign support General Franco would collapse.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);44;The right hon. Gentleman has entirely misunderstood the argument. The specific point that I put was that, as he was supported by and dependent on foreign troops, he had clearly shown that he was not supported by a substantial portion of the Spanish people.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);194;I was glad to find myself coming more and more into agreement with the right hon. Gentleman as his speech proceeded. It is a matter of value and importance, extending far outside this House, that the party which he leads, and which plays such a very large part in moulding opinion in the country, should definitely range itself upon this issue at the side of His Majesty's Government. But I must confess that what has weighed with me a good deal in  these last few weeks was what the right hon. Gentleman a little tried to discount. I have felt it to be a most remarkable thing that when, on the London Committee, there was a definite difference, a distinct divergence, between the great Powers, and when the whole committee was summoned together, it was asserted broadly, and I believe truly, that no fewer than 23 out of those 27 Powers, if matters had been forced to a division, which happily they were not, would have followed the lead of the two great Western democracies, Great Britain and France. I think that is a tremendous event, and, believe me, it adds to our safety.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);184;As to this plan which has been put forward, I was very glad to hear the lucid defence of certain intricate points put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. Of course it is a compromise. It is a compromise between not only divergent but vehemently antagonistic views and interests. You cannot expect to find an attractive, symmetrical, clear-cut proposal such as would spring in its integrity from one man's mind,  when you have to cater for no fewer than 27 different nations. I have not the slightest doubt there are points in this plan which are extremely repugnant to Germany and Italy, but then, I imagine, there are also points in it which are repugnant to Soviet Russia, and there are some points which, perhaps, are not entirely in accord with the views of France. But if we are to keep the whole of these Powers together round the table, it is absolutely necessary for everybody to put up with a certain amount which they do not like, for the sake of producing a scheme upon which all may be able, possibly, to agree.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);12;I believe that that is playing a great part on both sides.

I would say that, when there is a genuine acceptance of the need for peace and genuine co-operation by others, we shall certainly join in.

I think that a statement of this kind is quite useful, because there are people who think that because we are piling up defences we are solely interested in piling up defences to make war. It is just as well to counter that kind of propaganda.

The sudden removal of these able and resolute men from the centre and summit of war direction in Australia inflicts an injury upon us all which I can be at no pains to conceal. In Brigadier Street and Mr. Fairbairn, in Sir Henry Gullett and Lieut.-General Sir Brudenell White, Australia has been robbed of some of her best and ablest sons at a moment when the gifts they had to offer were most precious.

In so doing, we shall give voice to the sorrow which in so many lands will be felt by all to whom the cause of freedom is dear. In this hour of battle there will be one other thought, equally spontaneous and equally widespread—Close the ranks, and carry on.

1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);64;May I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been drawn to a Notice of Motion which stands on the Paper in my name, and in the name of other hon. Members, on the subject of a Select Committee to inquire into the circumstances of the disclosure of Budget information last week, and  whether he has any statement' to make upon the subject?
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);148;Yes, Sir, my attention has been called to this Motion. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) made a very full and frank statement in public on the matter. He has paid a very heavy penalty for his indiscretion, and I know that he has the sympathy of Members in the misfortune which has come upon him. I am not myself able to see what further information is required in the matter, but neither my right hon. Friend nor the Government would oppose further inquiry—because there is nothing whatever to conceal in the matter—if it was thought necessary. To oppose it might seem to suggest there was something. There is nothing whatever to reveal beyond what my right hon. Friend has already announced to the House. Therefore, if a desire is evinced to set up a Select Committee the Government would not oppose it.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);70;I am very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. I think it is in the general interest and in the interests of the House, and also in the interests of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the facts of this matter shall be put upon record by a responsible Committee in such a way as to put an end to any slanderous rumours which may be in circulation.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);21;I understand that such a Motion is debatable and I should like to consider it when it is definitely put down.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);30;No, Sir. The Government considered this matter, and the position they have taken up is that if there is a demand for an inquiry the Government will not oppose it.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);26;There is a formal demand for the inquiry from the Opposition, and I believe that the demand is also supported by the party below the Gangway.
1941-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-4-22;Spain (British Loan);49;My right hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a statement on the subject of this loan agreement on 10th April last. The agreement will be laid as a White Paper. It would not be a good thing to debate it—just now—certainly not in public.
1941-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-4-22;Spain (British Loan);52;Many people thought in July of last year that Spain would enter the war against us, and I think that it is very largely due to the brilliant discharge of his duties in Spain that our relations with that country have tended to improve and not to deteriorate at this critical time.
1941-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-4-22;Spain (British Loan);122;I do not know what is meant by the last remark about another fait accompli at all. This policy has been most carefully considered, and the state of our affairs in every part of the world does not allow matters of this kind to be handled in a rough and reckless or debonair fashion. We do not wish to do anything which would give any excuse for a breach at the present time between us and the Spanish Government; and I certainly consider that the starving condition of the people of Spain fully justifies assistance being given by Great Britain, and by the United States, if she chooses so to act, irrespective of whether any expressions of gratitude are forthcoming or not.

1951-10-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-10-04;The King's Illness;71;I associate myself and those who sit on this side of the House fully with the well chosen words which the Prime Minister has just used. We have all felt a very great and prolonged sense of anxiety since the full extent of the serious illness of His Majesty was made known; and he has certainly had the prayers of all his subjects in the ordeals through which he has passed.

1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);72;The procedure of the House of Commons enables all these broad matters to be put to the test on numerous opportunities throughout the Session, even without asking for a special day, but the demand for a special day, made by sufficient backing, is one that every Government must consider. I must be understood to be making no promise of any kind at a time when we consider our actions are in dispute.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);37;I never said anything of the sort. I must make it absolutely clear that it does not rest with any Prime Minister to dissolve Parliament. The utmost he can do is to tender advice to the Crown.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);76;This is one of the exceptional occasions when the Prerogative of the Crown comes into play and where in doubtful circumstances the Crown would refer to other advisers. It has been done on several occasions. I must make it absolutely clear that it does not rest with the Government of the day. It would be most improper on my part to use any language which suggested that I have the power to make such a decision.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);50;The Government have accepted, I am told, 50 or 60 Amendments. The whole Bill is being shaped as it goes along. The reason that this difficulty arose was that something much bigger and extraneous was tacked on. That s the answer to my hon. Friend, whom I respect so much.
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;25;(by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has any statement to make on negotiations between this country and Egypt.
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;16;Will this report be made to the House before definite decisions have been taken or after?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;64;I ventured to say the other day that the House has not claimed to interfere with the treaty-making power of the Government. What does the right hon. Gentleman then mean by "full and proper rights"? Would we be safe in assuming that he will endeavour to carry the House with him before he commits himself to a definite decision on so grave a matter?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;121;Does not this amount to the fact that we are to be told nothing about this matter until a decision is taken definitely one way or the other, which may perhaps involve the immediate or early withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone with all the consequences that that entails in the Middle East and beyond? If that is the position, are we not bound on this side of the House to initiate a debate upon the matter and make sure that the House has an opportunity of bringing home to the Government its opinion about the state of affairs in the Levant and in Egypt about which there is a great deal of anxiety at the present time?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;79;Is not the right hon. Gentleman avoiding the point? According to what he said, the rights of Parliament would be fully preserved in that after he has taken decisions and made agreements which Parliament could not alter without a breach of our traditions and customs, and only after, we are allowed an opportunity of debating the matter. Would it not be wiser and better, as the Treaty does not end until 1956, for us to discuss this matter beforehand?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;51;That is very important. If it is understood that no agreement which is now being made will have validity until the House has had an opportunity of discussing it, which is what I understood the right hon. Gentleman to say, I shall press the matter no further. Is that the position?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;79;Is it not clear that the Hoare-Laval Agreement was not a treaty? Is it not also clear that the right hon. Gentleman does not mean as a general rule to abrogate the treaty-making rights of the Executive under the Crown? Is it not also clear that he is making an exception in this case by making any provisional agreement which may be reached between him and the Egyptian authorities a matter which will require the approval of the House?
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;204;It is my pleasant duty to congratulate the two hon. Members who have moved and seconded the Address. It always seems to me that these Members are given an extremely difficult task, and yet every year we find Members who are able to carry it out with distinction. This year, I think, the hon. Members have had a more than usually difficult task, because they were trying to make bricks without straw, and, if they did not make any they certainly did not drop any. I could not help but admire the wit and the tact of the hon. Mover. We all enjoyed his wit. I am sure that we all noticed his tact, because he alluded extremely little to what was in the Gracious Speech. The hon. Seconder skimmed rather rapidly over it and had one flight of imagination; and I congratulate him, too, on his tact. In truth, there is not very much in this programme which the Government are putting before the House. I would like to ask one question before making some remarks about it. Perhaps the Prime Minister will tell us when we shall receive the report on Palestine and when we shall have a Debate on that subject.
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;224;I well recollect that when I first became a Member of this House as a young fellow of 50 I was overawed at first by my surroundings. I remember one particular nightmare which used to obsess me in my early years, and that was lest I should be invited to move or second  the Address to the Throne, a task which I was quite convinced was entirely beyond my powers. Fortunately, those in authority thought so, too. I was not asked, and I do not suppose I ever shall be asked now, to do so, but the consequence is that I have been able to enjoy over a long period listening, without any fear of comparison, to a succession of brilliant performances by those who have undertaken this peculiarly difficult and delicate task. We have been accustomed in the past to a very high standard on these occasions; I agree with the right hon. Gentleman opposite that we can congratulate my two hon. Friends who have moved and seconded the Address in that they have in no way lowered the high level of the speeches. Both the speeches to which we have listened this afternoon presented just that happy combination of sound common sense, shrewd phrasing, sharp wit and delicate humour which is what we look for in speeches in such times as these.
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;51;That will make a very short day. In addition to that there are Bills, which will reduce the time still more, and many hon. Members will want to attend Armistice services in their own constituencies. I wonder whether the right hon.

1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;30;That is a matter which will require consideration; but I shall be very happy to take it into consideration, and communicate with the right hon. Gentleman through the usual channels.

1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);23;(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make on the development of the atom bomb by Russia.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);28;No, Sir. I do not think that it would be in the public interest to make any further statement at present beyond the announcement made on 23rd September.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);65;In reply to the first question, that is answered in the announcement made on 23rd September. The second question I do not think really arises. On the third question, we have already declared our policy. The matter is being discussed in America in the United Nations meeting and we made perfectly clear our policy that we believe there should be international control of atomic energy.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);25;The right hon. Gentleman, I presume, would be agreeable to this matter being discussed at some convenient time when we reassemble in a little while?
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);17;It on reflection it was considered useful, I should certainly be prepared to give that full consideration.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);30;The matter and the attitudes of the various Governments concerned have been fully expressed. Great progress would be made if the Government of Soviet Russia would agree to international inspection.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);37;The question of the atom weapon falls into its place with other considerations but, as I am advised, the fact of the existence of the atom bomb does not necessarily mean that all other weapons are obsolete.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);45;I am not prepared to give a reply of that kind. In this question we are working closely with the United States of America and with Canada. Obviously, the question of what disclosures of information are made must be a matter for consideration between Governments.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);8;I was dealing with the point of inspection.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);20;I think that is an entirely different question. What hours a scientist can effectively work is a matter for consideration.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);13;I am not prepared to give any further information at Late present moment.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);23;Yes, I quite agree, but the whole point is that there are only certain countries where the people can make their voices effective.
1943-4-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-15;War Pensions;139;I should not be justified in placing upon this House and on my right hon. Friend the Minister of Pensions the very heavy burden which would inevitably result from the appointment of a Select Committee unless the main principles of the war pensions system were the subject of serious controversy. Such questions as have been raised in Debate or otherwise do not affect essential principles but are rather concerned with matters which fall properly within the scope of existing machinery. I understand that my right hon. Friend has already brought a number of these questions before his Central Advisory Committee, on which the various parties in this House are well represented, and that others are being put down for discussion at future meetings. This procedure is likely to be much more expeditious than the deliberations of a Select Committee.

The three great Powers are in entire agreement upon the general aims which bind our alliance and we have every need to keep in the closest association in this dangerous and momentous phase of the war.
1944-12-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-20;Greece (Situation);14;That is a topic with which, obviously, I should not attempt to deal now.

I have not the slightest doubt that effective co-operation will go on, in all aspects of the war. We had a certain task thrown upon us, and we are discharging it to the best of our ability.
1944-12-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-20;Greece (Situation);14;I think it would certainly be a justifiable conclusion to form at this stage.

1954-7-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-7-13;Members Of Parliament (Financial Interests);46;In answer to the first part of the Question, I would refer the hon.

1952-11-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-11-13;Nato And Pacific Council (Consultations);5;I will consider the suggestion.
1940-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-20;Seamen's Funerals;87;No German airmen have been buried at Blyth. Two unidentified bodies of unknown nationality which were washed ashore on 14th February and 6th March respectively were buried by the local civil authorities in accordance with the usual practice. The naval authorities always endeavour to provide proper funeral ceremonies for British naval personnel who lose their lives at sea, and I am asking that during the war this practice shall be extended as widely as possible to cover the kind of case the hon. Member has in mind.
1940-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-20;Seamen's Funerals;18;I am glad that the hon. Member put the Question down. It is certainly one which requires attention.
1940-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-20;Seamen's Funerals;99;Yes, Sir. I intended my reply to apply not only to the regular personnel of the Navy, but to the large number of British seamen who are risking their lives every day in the North Sea in essential measures for our protection. I cannot guarantee that there will be available at every port and at all times a naval firing party, but we will do the best we can to make it available for all these cases which the hon. Member has in mind. May I express my obligation that the matter has been brought forward in this way?
1940-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-20;Seamen's Funerals;16;I cannot add to what I have said, but I entirely agree with the hon. Member.

1941-10-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-10-16;Select Committee On National Expenditure;110;Yes, Sir. Not only will I give my continuing attention to this matter, but, in view of the responsibilities which Parliament has laid upon me in respect of Memoranda from the Select Committee, I read the Memorandum myself within five days of its being sent forward in August, and minuted it immediately to the Departments concerned, requesting their consideration and action. As a result of the reports which I received, I came to the conclusion that the Sub-committee were not fully informed upon the operational aspects of the questions raised, nor upon the wider questions of policy, and that it would not be wise to follow the course they recommended.

Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition announced on 19th June, 1946, that the King had approved a recommendation that Remembrance Sunday should be celebrated on the Sunday before 11th November, unless 11th or 12th November be a Sunday.

1941-2-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-2-27;House Of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Bill;354;Surely, the House is not going to shelter behind party leaders; surely, the right hon. Member will not try to get behind such a poor little ill-filled sandbag as that. Now that I have shown hon. Members the camel they have already swallowed, I hope they will address themselves with renewed sense of proportion to this somewhat inconsiderable gnat. An office of profit is, in my view—I do not speak as a lawyer—a term of art. It applies to many positions where there is no remuneration. A Junior Lord of the Treasury, unpaid, is an office of profit, but a special mission, though it may be very highly paid and may last for years, is not a disqualifying office of profit. A foreign Embassy, even though, as in the case of the right hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps), it is a formal, definite, diplomatic appointment, and not a special mission in any sense, has, according to the advice we have received, been held not to disqualify as an office of profit. That advice has not been challenged, or has not yet been challenged, by the House or by the common informer. [An HON. MEMBER: "He takes no salary."] That has nothing to do with it. That is one of the anomalies I am trying to bring out. It would make no difference if the right hon. and learned Member took a salary. He  takes the fees of representation necessary to the discharge of these important duties. Even though it is a formal appointhment, it has not been challenged, though I must say I should have thought it was a very doubtful case. If an office was in existence before 1705, it may be held by a Member of Parliament and profit drawn from it unless, of course, it comes under a special ban in some later Statutes, which are numerous and obscure. The High Commissionership of one of our great Dominions, not having been in existence in 1705, thus disqualifies, whereas an Embassy to a foreign country does not. I am only putting it forward to show the anomalies.

Friend is not alone. The hon. and gallant Member for Ormskirk (Commander King-Hall) and the hon. Member for Rotherhithe (Mr. Benjamin Smith) are equally in this dangerous area, but worse may come. There may be a good many more fish in the net. My right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Burton, in his comfortable, secure position in that constituency, has not realised that not everyone is in that position of impeccable political stability which he has so long enjoyed.

1938-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-16;Civil Aviation;30;I was referring to the fact that the Prime Minister overlooked the point that when he originally set up the committee, it did not satisfy hon. Members on this side.

1938-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-16;Civil Aviation;153;I am not associating myself with that remark. In fact I do not. The Prime Minister has concentrated on that, but he has forgotten that he set up a committee which consisted, in the view of the rest of the House, of what you might call "Yes men." I think it is perfectly clear, in view of the emphatic terms of the report that we could not have expected to get a full and impartial report from persons in Government service. The report is a vindication of the rights of this House to operate through inquiry. That has been done on many occasions. The Prime Minister is wrong if he thinks that these inquiries do not occur when grave events are proceeding. There was a famous committee of inquiry into the Crimean War, and an interesting speech was made by Lord John Russell, who resigned when the Motion was put down. He said:

If you are going to make all these changes, I suggest in the first place that the Secretary of State ought to be changed. I suggest also that in view of the extreme condemnation of the people who are running Imperial Airways there should be a change in the management. They have been subject to pretty severe condemnation. The report says:

In 1949 restrictions on the export of goods of strategic importance were increased, as announced to the House in February, 1949; but they were not applied to contracts placed before the new arrangements came into force. Some of the goods take a long time to produce, and some orders placed before that date have not yet been completed. These restrictions have been kept under constant review, in consultation with friendly Powers, and during the past few weeks we have been re-examining the whole matter in the light of the international situation and of our own needs.

I am not sure, but I am told they are for Poland. [Laughter.] It does not make any difference whatever except this—if hon. Members wait for one moment. As a matter of fact, what we are sending to Poland is subject to a particular agree-  ment. The terms of that agreement have to be looked at very closely. It is not exactly on the same level. It does make a difference what exactly the terms are. We are looking at them and if we need that boring machine, it will be retained in this country; but, as a matter of fact, it is not due for completion for some months yet. We are looking very fully into that. [An HON. MEMBER: "Why not have looked before now?"] We have not the information on everything that has been ordered long ahead. If, however, there are any other points on that, I am sure my right hon. Friend will be pleased to answer specific points. Perhaps it would come better in the course of the Debate than at the end of what I am afraid has been an unduly long speech.

1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);98;What I said was that the machinery and tools were being delivered in respect of contracts already entered into, and the statement made in 1949—I think in February—by the President of the Board of Trade to this House was that that was the practice we were following. I did not say that if at the present time we required these we should not step in and take them over. I was referring to what the practice was then. As a matter of fact, a whole lot of trading goes on which is outside the control of the Government.

The normal promotion board machinery has been suspended for the period of the war, and in any case is not applicable to tem-  porary appointments and promotions. Mr. Chatfield is one among a considerable number of persons brought in to the Admiralty from outside as temporary administrative officers. The only difference I can discern between his case and that of the five other persons similarly appointed is that on the day before the outbreak of war he succeeded in obtaining an appointment as a temporary clerk. He had already served in the Royal Navy as a cadet and midshipman for three years before being invalided. Thereafter he had joined the Territorial Army and was again invalided. He therefore sought to serve in a clerical capacity, that being the only one which the state of his health permitted.

1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;338;I gathered that it was the desire of the House that there should be a further discussion of the war and foreign situations and policies at this time, before any new important international conferences take place. I will try to survey the whole—I cannot say the whole, but large and select portions—of this vast scene to the best of my ability. It has fallen to the hard lot of Britain to play a leading part in the Mediterranean, and particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean. We have great responsibilities, and we have made great exertions, there. In Italy the British, or  British-controlled, divisions under Field Marshal Alexander's command, and still more if the whole area of the Mediterranean is included, outnumber three-fold those of the United States. There is battle along the whole front in Italy, and behind the front, in the hard-stricken peninsula, are many economic and political difficulties. The old structure with its hateful rigours has been destroyed, and in its place we have had to raise a Government of improvisation. We have the Bonomi Government, which has been trying to do its best under extraordinary difficulties, but which, of course, has no electoral authority behind it. But now, at any time, perhaps in a few months, perhaps much sooner—for no one can tell what is proceeding in the minds of the German war leaders—the Germans will be driven out of Italy, o will perhaps withdraw; and immediately the great populous districts of the North, the cities of Turin, Milan, and other centres of industry and activity, and a large population of all kinds of political views but containing great numbers of vehement or violent politicians, and in touch with brave men, who have been fighting, and maintaining a guerilla warfare in the Alps, all these will be thrown—probably at a time when the Northern regions have been stripped bare of food by the retreating Germans—hungry, upon the fragile structure of the Italian Government in Rome, with consequences which cannot be accurately foreseen, and certainly not measured.

1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;169;I have spared no pains to try to learn what I believe are the facts. I consider myself far better informed on this matter than I was a month or six weeks ago, but what I have learned with great pains and patience has led me to a strengthening of my original conclusions, and among them is undoubtedly the conclusion that the E.L.A.S. armed bands, at any rate for the last two years, played very little part against the Germans. Now, I really cannot argue with my hon. Friend. No doubt he and some of those who hold his views will have an opportunity of extolling their glorious deeds. I, personally, am not prepared to pay them anything like the tributes which are paid to the heroic French or Belgian Maquis, or to the men in Italy who are in the mountains fighting their desperate battle. It seems to me they took aid from us with their eyes on more important local matters after the general war was over.

I am reading the facts and he does not like the facts. I am telling him the truth and he fears the truth. These facts reflect on those whom he has so thoughtlessly championed, and I will give him further warning. There is a great deal more to come, and I think that the Committee has a right to hear it. [Interruption.] When I quote from the colonel of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and say he gathered his information from the advanced dressing station, where he examined a number of these victims, the hon. Gentleman opposite immediately tries to suggest it is all some fake propaganda. He did not use those words, but the whole sense of his interruption was to cast doubt on an officer who has not the slightest interest, political or otherwise, to do anything but collect, gather and convey the truth. Mr. Leeper adds: 
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;170;I think there is a great difference between putting people to death for the crime of rebellion, or bringing them to penal processes, and making sure that your Government Departments are not full of people who are working for the other side. I am dealing with the whole question of amnesty which relates to the penal processes of law, such as imprisonment or sentences of death, and an amnesty certainly does not mean that persons who are not trusted by the Government of the day will immediately be made Cabinet Ministers, or that employees who were found to have left their posts in the crisis and taken part in the fighting on the opposite side to the Government of the day, should be reinstated or left in their positions. No one can stand for that, and I want to be very careful not to lead the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale into any ideas that I am promising something that goes beyond the actual words I have used.

General Scobie has throughout been in a quasi-political position, in the closest negotiations with all the different quarters. He has not been simply a military commander charged purely with the application or non-application of military force.

1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;213;I want to make a short intervention in this Debate in reply to some of the points that have been made, and try to make plain what, in my opinion, are the broad facts of the situation. The whole of this Greek question has got involved in an atmosphere of emotion. It is quite understandable but it is quite inimical to our getting a clear view. We in the Government have to deal with these foreign situations in the light of the facts as known to us. We take every opportunity We can to exercise our utmost vigilance, to try to arrive at these facts. Let me say at once it is not always easy for anyone to get the whole of the facts when dealing with a foreign country, a country which has only just been cleared of a foreign invader, a country that was for a long time under a dictatorship. It is not at all easy in such cases to get the exact facts about what happened. It is not very easy to sum up  the various personalities, particularly when their names are often like each other and one is not always sure which is which. It is not at all easy to judge the exact state of public opinion.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;92;That is exactly the point I am making. We give these matters our very close attention. Let me say here, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Cocks), that the foreign policy of this Government is not a matter that is left to the impulse of a Prime Minister or to the sole discretion of a Foreign Secretary. These matters are debated and discussed very fully in Cabinet. I can assure him we have endless discussions. Therefore we do try to arrive at an opinion on the facts.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;150;My hon. Friend gave a long list. The Foreign Secretary will be replying to-morrow. My hon. Friend gave us rather a long history. I can tell him straight away that there are a great many instances on which he was completely mistaken. I would ask him to think that on these matters I am as desirous as he is of seeing that the truth shall prevail and that we shall support the principles we hold in common. I would not like him, therefore, to assume always that the word of a Greek, or the word of Mr. Drew Pearson, is better than the word of His Majesty's Ministers. We are all, of course, subject to temptation in this matter. We all tend to lend credence to something which seems to support our own point of view. Otherwise, I am quite sure my hon. Friend would not have quoted Drew Pearson.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;45;In matters of foreign policy this habit is increased by the practice of dividing the world up into Right and Left. To many people everything that comes from the Left is suspect, and to others everything that is done by the Left must be supported.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;137;The point my hon. Friend is making is not a very good one. I am saying that is a habit of all of us. I know people who think that all people who may disagree with them are Bolsheviks. I  sometimes think that the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) thinks that everyone who does not agree with him is a Fascist. But, as a matter of fact, when one comes to Right and Left, people of very different views are grouped together under these very wide umbrellas. I think, as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe pointed out so well, that was the case with E.A.M. It is quite a mistake to think that E.A.M. consisted of one lot of people—of Communists. It consisted of Liberals, Socialists and Communists, people of varied political views.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;81;I am afraid the hon. Member will find that he did if he will look at the report in HANSARD of what he said. He talked of this British Government coming in to support one side against the other. The point is that we came into Greece for a Government of all parties, Socialists and all the rest. We must get that right. It is a mistake to try to lump all people together as Right or Left, and to suggest——
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;6;I am not giving way. [Interruption.]
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;19;I am making my own speech now. The hon. Member need not talk about what the Prime Minister says.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;348;I do not agree with my hon. Friend's translation of what the Prime Minister said. As I was saying, it is a mistake to try to lump people together like this, and to be deflected from principles by imagining that some people are all Right and some people all Left, particularly in South-Eastern Europe. When you are dealing with people like the Greeks, who are rather temperamental perhaps, and with countries which, like those of South-Eastern Europe, have had a very short experience of the working of democratic institutions, you should never try to judge them exactly on our own basis. Therefore, you should try to get quite clear in your mind what your principle is. I do not believe in dictatorship of the Right or of the Left, or in seizure by force by the Right or by the Left, whether a person calls himself a king or a leader or anything else. We believe in democracy. I hold that the trouble here has been that, while we had everything fixed up, with a Government ranging right through the whole block of political parties, which was in due course going to have a general election to decide where the majority lay, there was a forcible attempt by a minority to seize power. Some people who call themselves Left are not believers in democratic methods. It has been suggested, although it is not suggested so often now—although again, I think, my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe rather suggested it—that we were specially interested in putting back the King of Greece. We really are not. With the situation in Europe we had to deal with a great many Governments who, unfortunately, had been driven out of their own countries. Some were monarchists, some were republicans; in some cases there was not a Government, but only representatives. In any case, would it have been right for us, without the will of the people, to change the Government from a monarchy to a republic, or from a republic to a  monarchy? We had to deal with things as they were.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;151;It is not a question of a Fascist, but of a Right-Wing, Government. Do not fall into the error of the hon. Member for West Fife, of thinking that everybody who is Right-Wing is Fascist. They may be old-fashioned monarchists, Catholics, and the like. Do not let Hitler get away with it by giving him too many companions. Therefore, I say that we were right to see that the Greeks got a fair chance with their own Government. I would ask hon. Members to get away from that typical British habit of dealing with the Balkans by falling in love with one party or one nationality. It is very difficult to get knowledge of all the facts. I would say that, on the record of this Government and on the known opinions of this Government, we have the right to be trusted to carry out the principles in which we believe.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;29;I have stuck a great deal more closely to carrying out the principles in which I believe and in working with my party than has the hon. Member opposite.

A wider area of sea is notified as dangerous to shipping for a limited period, but not closed. It has never been considered a violation of the freedom of the seas to use areas outside territorial waters temporarily for gunnery and bombing practice, but when shipping is about to enter a danger area it has been warned off, and, if necessary, escorted to safe waters. For the British test in Australia a danger area of about 25,000 square miles was prescribed. The United States action does not run contrary, therefore, to our own policy, or with the principle on which we notify areas as dangerous to shipping. No action by Her Majesty's Government is, therefore, contemplated.

I personally think it would be a very grievous thing if impediments grew up in the way of meetings of what have been called the Big Three—the three major Powers—because, although we all want much larger organ isms to come into being, without the agreement and accord of the three major Powers there may well be an obstacle to all future development. I, therefore, wish to compliment the Foreign Secretary on his resolve to go, and to wish him the greatest possible success in his mission. These personal contacts are of very great value and I trust that they will, in this case, result in the settlement of a great many difficult points and also in the re building of the sympathy and good will between the three major Powers without which we should never have got to this satisfactory conclusion.
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;168;I desire to raise this evening the question of the position of the Foreign Secretary not being a Member of this House. Let me say at the outset that I am not questioning in any way the qualifications of Lord Halifax for the position of Foreign Minister. We all know his great services, his high character and his great abilities. The Prime Minister no doubt selected the man who, he thought, was best fitted for this position, and it is not for us to question that; indeed, I am bound to say that I fully recognise the great difficulty in which the Prime Minister found himself. It would be very difficult for him to find somebody who was qualified by experience and ability to hold the position and was at the same time a supporter of his policy. Between those who had held the office already and had not been a conspicuous success, and those who were thought not likely to be successful, the choice was somewhat narrow.

1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;120;I am not dealing with that specific point; I am controverting the idea that there is some particular virtue in having someone who is not brought into contact with this House. I think it was a dereliction of duty on the part of the House of Commons that it only had three Debates on foreign affairs in all those years before 1914, and I agree with the Colonial Secretary in thinking it unfortunate that the idea, which some Members still hold, had grown up that the Foreign Secretary could be left to carry on without being brought into contact with public opinion. Dealing with the start of the War, the present Foreign Secretary, in May, 1919, went on to say: 
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;74;There is clearly no serious constitutional issue raised to-night. I find myself in very general agreement with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Liberal party on this particular point, and much that he said in his speech, I think, commended itself to the House. There is only one word of advice which I would venture to offer him, with great respect to a party leader, and that is the old Scotch proverb: 
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;47;I am not eligible. It seems to me that everyone who looks at this matter fairly and gives reasonable consideration to the difficulties of the Prime Minister must feel that there was no solution to be found in any of the candidatures to which I have referred.
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;285;After the tense atmosphere and the strenuous battles of a week ago, it has been for me quite a change to-night to be able to sit back and to watch those who criticised me then in all parts of the House answering one another's criticisms. I do not know which I enjoyed more—the amusing analysis of my right hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) or the protest of the right hon. Gentleman opposite for the lapse from virtue of his right hon. Friend on the bench below the Gangway. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition addressed to me one question. He challenged my action as a breach of established Parliamentary practice. I did not understand that he was maintaining that position in his speech this evening, and indeed I think it would be very hard for him to maintain it. For although Parliamentary practice does from time to time tend to become established, it would puzzle anyone to say how you are to find the exact moment when establishment takes place. Unless the right hon. Gentleman opposite is to be the arbiter in the matter and to lay down when establishment has been reached, I do not know  how we are to make up our minds on the subject. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Gorton Division (Mr. Benn) said that I had flouted and neglected the precedent of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, that great House of Commons man, who, when he had to appoint a Foreign Secretary, appointed a Member of this House because he himself was a Member of this House, thereby establishing a precedent which the right hon. Gentleman says we ought never to depart from.

1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;142;The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I know about this, and in its precursory period, it was always before us when we were colleagues together in the National Government in the later stages of the war. All that we have seen since, are the various manifestations of the forces and factors that are at work. They are alarming and sensational symptoms but the causes have not changed. The root causes have not changed, as we knew them two, three and four years ago, and the Government are well aware of this. There is, therefore, no reason for saying that the new change now proposed by the Minister of Defence from 12 to 18 months' service is required by the darkening of the foreign situation, and I am glad that he did not stress it unduly. The basic facts have not altered.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;143;I wish I could have an opportunity of affording the proof. That, however, is a date upon which it rests  with the Prime Minister to advise the Crown. In 1945, however, as I say, the relations were good, and in my opinion the Government made a mistake—a view which I expressed at the time because I do not try to be wise after the event—in not taking advantage of the situation. I think they made a mistake in believing it necessary to adhere pedantically and rigidly to the scheme of demobilisation to which we have all agreed. But the Government did not take my advice, and the result was that throughout 1946 and a large part of 1947, many hundreds of thousands of men were kept uselessly with the Colours, instead of being able to return to industry where labour was urgently needed.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;30;May I correct the right hon. Gentleman? I did not ask for my right hon. Friend's resignation. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Lawson) desired to retire.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;89;I thank the Prime Minister. Naturally, we cannot always tell what lies behind a Ministerial resignation, but I am quite sure that if my right hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street felt himself in any way unequal to his task, he would be the first man to come forward and lay down a highly important and remunerative public post. As I say, after him came the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bassetlaw. This was somewhat unexpected to those who had read his regular column in the "Daily Mirror"——
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;153;I am ready to withdraw the words "Daily Mirror" and to substitute the words "Sunday Pictorial." I should not like to have a dispute on any such matter. The right hon. Gentleman served with the Expeditionary Force which was safely evacuated at Dunkirk. As I have already said, this again was a somewhat unexpected appointment. I none the less gave as much support as I could to the right hon. Gentleman, and I am sure he tried his best. However, in this case am I right in saying that the Prime Minister took a more severe view? Fifty per cent. of bullseyes is not a bad average. The Prime Minister took a more severe view and dismissed the right hon. Gentleman in arbitrary fashion, so I hear, in October, 1947. It must not be an unmitigated reflection upon the right hon. Gentleman, because the time for this change was influenced by other considerations.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;154;Phrases which he used have run all over the country. The "tinker's cuss" was a household word, and he has made that homely and necessary instrument of an honoured profession common to the daily usage of all classes in the land. He had, however, undoubtedly gained political popularity with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, those gentlemen below the Gangway who attend in ever smaller numbers and with ever less enthusiasm every week. A place had to be found for the right hon. Gentleman at short notice. This struck the knell of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bassetlaw. He was the man for whom the bell tolled. The appointment of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Seaham to be Secretary of State for War compares very well with the appointment of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) to represent us at the United Europe meetings.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;87;I do not know why the hon. and learned Member should have wished to prevent me stating a case. After all, men cannot be trained without weapons. The proposal to increase the period of service to 18 months is a serious one, and should be considered in all its bearing on the Second Reading. The idea that by preventing chunks of the subject being discussed the House will be able to arrive at a just conclusion  is a profound illusion which only masters and captivates inferior minds.

Nothing is more vital to the self-respect of a soldier than to have his rifle and bayonet, by which he can defend his life and honour. I was saying: is it a fact that great masses of material were taken out to sea and sunk? I want to know. We are told that great quantities of arms and ammunition of all kinds were given away or sold to foreign States. I am not speaking of anything done under the Brussels Agreement, but preceding that. Three or three and a half years have not sufficed to enable the Government to make a plan or scheme for the Army, but they have been ample to enable them to dissipate immense quantities of munitions of war which they inherited from their predecessors—a great inheritance which in this, as in other fields, they have certainly not increased.

I ask him: Can the Government now produce, with four times the comparable money voted in 1914, an efficient and well-equipped Force of six or seven divisions, be they infantry, tanks or parachutists, a Force available either for an emergency on the Continent or for home defence? Can the Government produce with four times the money, the Force which was produced by the Liberal Government in 1914? Can they produce a half of it? Can they produce a third of it? Can they produce a quarter of it? I will not go any further today, but I say that with four times the money and unlimited control of man-power, the Government are unable to produce even a quarter of what was available for emergencies in 1914. Here I am speaking  only of the Regular or Field Forces. In Mr. Asquith's and Lord Haldane's day—now nearly 35 years ago—before the first World War, we had, besides the Expeditionary Force I have mentioned, 14 Territorial infantry divisions, which in a year became good troops. According to the Government's present plan the Territorial Army is not even to be fully constituted until 1954—six years hence.

Member is referring to the recent removal of a number of Greek seamen from one of H.M. destroyers in a United Kingdom port. This ship had seen active service in the Royal Navy, but after being refitted was to have been transferred to the Royal Hellenic Navy. In view, however, of recent disturbances in the Mediterranean, and of unrest among the officers and men detailed to take over the ship, the Admiralty were unable to allow her to be commissioned with a Greek crew. The Greek parties on board were accordingly withdrawn and it is quite incorrect to speak of a Greek ship having been disarmed in a British Port.

Admiral Andrew Cunningham used the expression that it would be "a fifth wheel on the coach." Admiral Tovey, who commanded the Home Fleet for a long time, and had a very important action at sea, and Lord Cork and Orrery have spoken in the same sense. I have here a letter, which I am authorised to read, from Sir Percy Noble, who has not hitherto expressed himself in public, but who has unequalled credentials, because he managed the business himself with success last time. It says: 
1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);171;I was coming to all that, but I was talking of the coastal waters. I ask what that means because the Eastern Atlantic like the Western is under Supreme American command. It is the coastal waters alone that are reserved for Great Britain and I am asking if they end at the 100-fathom line. [HON. MEMBERS: "The Minister does not know."] In any case the area is severely restricted round our own coast, and the line that is drawn, be it the 100-fathom line or not, like the line that will be drawn across the Atlantic in no way corresponds to any boundary which applies to U-boat attack. The English Channel is reserved to us. It is surely not more vital to the integrity of the reception of convoys than the Bay of Biscay or the waters between Iceland and Ireland, or the North Sea, or the Arctic approaches to and from North Russia. It is all one story, and one story that can only be intelligently told from one place.
1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);118;It is rather difficult to work out these rule-of-three sums. [Laughter.] Hon. Members opposite laugh at that; that is all they are fit for. Why should they laugh because I am not prepared to argue that question of whether it is a proportionately larger reserve? It is a grave and foolish thing to cast away valuable ships at the end of a war. It is much better to keep them, even if you do not want them, in care and maintenance, and then you can never tell when they will turn out to be  useful. I have not worked it out in proportion, but at any rate the Americans have a far larger material reserve than we have.

We have not let our Mercantile Marine diminish. On the contrary, here are the figures. [Interruption.] I think I have the right to put forward the case for the potential contribution which Britain can make to war and transport on the seas. The United States have 12,400,000 tons of merchant shipping in use and 14 million tons in reserve. They have 250,000 tons under construction. Great Britain has 16,600,000 tons in use, or 19,600,000 tons if the Commonwealth and Empire are added, and two million tons under construction, some of it for foreign account. Moreover, we have far larger reserves of merchant—

However, the "damned old fool" has accepted the apology.

I may say that they are all countries for whom I have the strongest regard and from whom I have received many compliments and honours. But let me take four of them—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland. Though we accept the statement that the American Navy is double as strong as the British, the British Navy, even in its present phase, is more than 12 times as strong as all these four put together. Even if France be included, their combined strength is less than a quarter of ours.

On the contrary, I am saying only what I think is right and true, and should be considered and weighed by the Committee and the Government. I say that there are almost as many powerful arguments in favour of the United States having the command in the Mediterranean as there are against them haying the over-riding command in the Atlantic.

Reports were received yesterday indicating that forces from North Korea had crossed the 38th Parallel at a number of points, in the course of the invasion of the Korean Republic. At the request of the Government of the United States of America an emergency meeting of the Security Council was held, at which a resolution was passed to the effect that the action of the forces of North Korea constituted a breach of the peace. The resolution called for the immediate cessation of hostilities, and called upon the authorities of North Korea to withdraw forthwith their armed forces to the 38th Parallel. The resolution further called upon all  members to render every assistance to the United Nations in the execution of this resolution and to refrain from giving assistance to the North Korean authorities. The delegate of the Soviet Union did not attend.

I know it is Latin but there are enough public school men opposite who ought to be able to translate it. In my belief, it means good faith, common honesty, decent Parliamentary behaviour. Nobody has attempted to challenge that in any way. What we have challenged is his judgment in this matter and the manner in which he interpreted the rules of the House.

It is, I think, fundamentally a House of Com  mons matter, and we are fortunate that on this occasion we have not had that party division which sometimes makes discussion on the setting up of a Select Committee somewhat acrimonious. Here we have an issue arising which concerns the rights of the whole of the Members of this House. The issues are very far-reaching and are of the utmost importance to this House, this country and to democracies throughout the whole world. They involve the liberties and the rights of the Members of this House acting in the performance of their duty to their constituencies. They involve the practice of our Parliamentary institutions, and they raise questions as to the relationship between the Executive and the Members of this House, and also the question of the relationship of the Executive to the Law Officers of the Crown.

1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;279;I shall certainly endeavour to fulfil in the spirit as well as in the letter the obligation which you, Mr. Speaker, indicated to us at the beginning of this discussion, and certainly I agreed with the Prime Minister when he said that it would be very foolish for us to attempt to do the work of the Select Committee for them. It is quite certain that in this House we could not go into the personal issues involved. Each one of these cases which have been presented to us represents only the most abridged form in which the Member or Minister concerned would state his points, and in order to form any judgment upon the merits, it would be necessary to have a far longer statement and to have it thrashed out by examination and cross-examination. Therefore, I can assure you, Sir, that you will not find that I shall endeavour to open in any detailed way the personal question involved; though I consider that the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Opposition, in certain remarks which he made upon the minor aspects of this case, the question of the usage of  Members by Ministers, was fully justified in saying what he did. I propose to confine myself to a comparatively small number of general observations which I believe it is appropriate to make on such occasions, as they are intended to have a suggestive effect to the Committee which very soon will begin its labours, and also because there are certain points at the present time which are of real importance and on which it is really important that opinion should be expressed in this House.
1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;115;I am not concerned as to whether what I say is liked in any quarter of the House. I am concerned in stating a case which I believe it is my duty to state. I do trust that the Committee—I do not intend to go at all into the personal issues—will examine the action of the Attorney-General, whose well meaning, upright character endears him to all of us, but nevertheless it does seem to me that a mixing-up of functions is very much to be deprecated and that informal discussions upon matters which may take a criminal turn are not consonant either with the standard of British justice or with the propriety of Parliamentary life.
1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;187;I am endeavouring to deal with the question in a general way, and I say that we have had statements or speeches about the anti-aircraft artillery which are misleading, which I have characterised in this House as misleading, and which are in some ways more to be criticised because very often they are verbally and literally true. The point that I am approaching is this: It may be that  such statements do comfort the country, even if they deceive it, but the question which I think the Committee should turn its attention to, dwell upon, and weigh carefully is whether this kind of statements deceive possible foreign adversaries. I should have thought there was no branch of our defence upon which it was more easy for information to be obtained than about the state of our anti-aircraft artillery. There are thousands of men in the units. They know perfectly well what the main facts are, what are the weapons they have and what are the weapons they have not. They are, I have no doubt, indignant at the misleading statements which they consider are made about them.

We are all also very glad that the Government in this matter have not been bound by a narrow view of the precedents for such a tribute. There have been exceptions, and they have been made in accordance with the general feeling of the House, which, in such matters, is probably the safest of guides. The Prime Minister has mentioned two outstanding cases where the exact forms were not observed, but where the feelings of the House desired an opportunity of corporate expression. Oliver Stanley may well be another of these exceptions.

As one most anxious to sit at his feet in the matter, might I ask him whether he would vouchsafe any reason for this sweeping contradiction? Why is it utterly and totally wrong? What is the point of bringing the King's Recommendation into this matter when it clearly is a House of Commons insistence upon the financial provisions being observed? Of course, the King's Assent has been required and is invariably required to the proposing of a money charge, but that was simply to prevent everybody getting up in all parts of the House and bidding for popularity by proposing to give away large sums from the Exchequer to their constituents or other people in whom they had an interest. There is no relation at all.

Gentleman on this occasion will find its reciprocation. I am bound to say that I think the right hon. Gentleman, the Leader of the House, has handled the matter in a very conciliatory and painstaking manner and one must recognise the fact that it would be inconvenient for the House if the Bill had to be reprinted and certainly could not be taken tomorrow. It would be a complete derangement of our business, and, therefore, one regrets that the procedure was adopted in the first instance, but it was adopted on the false assumption that the Bill would have an uncontested passage because it was comparatively unimportant. We are confronted with the dilemma of spoiling the arrangements for Business which have been set out. We have made very effectively our protest on the broad principle of not ignoring the financial provisions which are an essential part of our procedure, and having done that, and having received from the Leader of the House what I take to be a clear assurance that this is not to be a precedent for general application to our legislation, I think we should not find it necessary to divide the House against the Motion.

1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;240;Yes. The right hon. Gentleman said that I denied that there was frontier rectification. I never denied any such thing, and I challenge him to find any place where I did. There is nothing sinister about it. A considerable part of the boundary has never been demarcated. It is obvious it must be necessary for a complete understanding between us, and if we are, as we desire, to remove possible sources of difference, it is absolutely necessary that we should determine where the boundary lies, and that we should also agree upon any rights which people living on either side of the border may have on the other side of the border for the purposes of watering cattle, and so on. Finally, on page 34, we have the Notes exchanged between the Egyptian Minister in Rome, the Italian Foreign Minister and Lord Perth, under which Egypt is associated with the  Declaration about Lake Tsana in Annex 5, and, as the Territorial Power concerned, with the Declaration about the Suez Canal which is found in Annex 8. I think that completes this brief analysis of the terms of the Agreement, and it will be observed that, whereas the Notes exchanged and the Bon Voisinage Agreement have already come into operation, the Protocol itself, with its Annexes, is not to come into force until such date as the Governments are hereafter to determine. I think the reason for that is very clear.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;99;With regard to Spain, there have been suspicions, which have been frequently expressed, that Italy not only when the time came would refuse to withdraw volunteers in accordance with the Non-Intervention Committee's Agreement, but that she also was aiming at acquiring for herself some permanent position, either in Spain itself or in some of Spain's overseas possessions. Therefore, I desire to call particular attention to Count Ciano's letter, which is to be found on page 28 of the White Paper, in which he gave three specific assurances to the British Government. First of all, he said the Italian Government: 
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;4;Is there general appeasement?
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;9;The Mediterranean Agreement is a step towards general appeasement.

On the coming into force it will certainly be de jureWhat I was saying was that the justification for recognition de jurewould be that it was an essential factor in getting back to general appeasement. I do not think we  could feel that we had got back or that we were taking steps towards general appeasement unless at the same time we could see that a Spanish settlement was within reach. That is a reason why we have made this Spanish settlement a prerequisite of the entry into force of this instrument, and a pre-requisite therefore of the recognition of the Italian conquest.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;10;What does the right hon. Gentleman mean by a settlement?

1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;95;There I leave myself to the judgment of the House. I cannot tell the House even when this Protocol and Annexes will come into force. No doubt the situation will clear itself up as time goes on. The right hon. Gentleman does not agree with that policy I know, but I do not think the House in general will feel that this is not a policy or that I am being unduly obscure at the moment in declining to say what is to be the final definition of the words "settlement of the Spanish situation."

1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;99;We have placed on the Paper an Amendment to the Prime Minister's Motion in which we set out our reasons for disagreeing with these proposals. The Prime Minister in his speech  —I am sorry he is not present—made his usual sneer at the Opposition. That is becoming habitual with him now. He said that it was not worth while taking any notice of the terms in which this Amendment was put down. He followed it up by indulging in ostentatious conversation all the time that my right hon. Friend the Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison) was talking.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;101;We are getting rather accustomed to that kind of thing now. If the Prime Minister had been here I was going to point out to him that that kind of treatment of the Opposition is not a sign of strength. It is a sign of weakness. Mere bad manners does not mean strength. There was a very obvious reason why the Prime Minister did not deal with this Amendment. It was because he could not controvert its terms. It opens by stating clearly something which is the subject of constant misrepresentation by Ministers of the Crown and Government supporters. It states: 
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;143;The Prime Minister chooses in this connection to use the names of Mazzini and Garibaldi. I think he might spare their memory. If he knows anything about Mazzini and Garibaldi he will know that they would not have approved of the Fascist regime. Does he suppose that Mazzini and Garibaldi would have joined in helping to destroy a friendly republic in Spain? If the Prime Minister knows anything of them he will remember that Garibaldi, in his old age in 1871, turned out again to fight for the French Republic, his fellow-republicans, against Germany, despite all the wrongs done to him by France when they took his birthplace from Italy. If he were alive to-day, Garibaldi would be with the Garibaldi legionaries, the men who made the Black-shirts run at Guadalajara. Garibaldi was well summed up by Mr. George Trevelyan in these words:

Whatever differences we may have, there is no doubt that this House of Commons has shown itself most vigilant in matters affecting the honour of Members or Ministers in questions of breach of confidence or questions of breach of privilege, or in questions of the character which are now brought to our notice. No Parliament has shown itself more vigorous and forward in this matter, and we have no complaint whatever to make of the course which the Prime Minister has proposed.

1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);197;I must say I regret the terms of the Government's Motion, and, although not altogether for the same reasons, I find myself endorsing the pleas which have been advanced from both the Opposition parties in the House. But I still hope that the Prime Minister has not said his last word on this subject. It is in that hope that I venture to offer a few reasons for my opposition to the Motion. This House is sometimes disparaged in this country, but abroad it counts. Abroad, the House of Commons is counted, and especially in dictator countries, as a most formidable expression of the British national will and an instrument of that will in resistance to aggression. "Surely that is a fact which must be admitted. The dictators themselves have not been slow to notice that minority opinion in this House has seemed in one way to influence the course of Government action. It is in accordance with minority opinion in this House that  we have come together upon a foreign policy upon which all are agreed, a foreign policy which the two dictator States deeply deprecate. Therefore, I say that we count deeply in their thoughts.

I have not noticed any signs of conversion visibly proceeding on the part of hon. Members who have listened to the proceedings on one side or the other. Before I examine the arguments that have been put forward there is one matter to which, I think, I must address myself for a minute or two. Two speeches were made by hon. Members opposite, the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker) and the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. G. Macdonald) which were particularly addressed to myself, and which greatly impressed me by their evident sincerity. They particularly asked me to believe that in the minds of the back benchers this was not regarded as a Vote of Censure. They wanted me, therefore, to give more unbiased and impartial consideration to what they put before me than I could have afforded if my own position were at stake. I am afraid the speech of the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Davidson) will have shown the two hon. Members that they cannot speak for the back benches either, and however much they might wish to disassociate themselves from the Front Bench, it is to the Front Bench that I must look for an official exposition of the views of the Opposition.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);279;No. That was not what he said. He said they would take the opportunity when the back of Parliament was turned to do something they would not be able to do when Parliament was sitting. I am not complaining about the right hon. Gentleman speaking frankly on this subject. On the contrary, I am rather grateful to him for having put the matter so clearly. All that I want to point out to my hon. Friends is that, when the matter has been put in that way, it is the good faith of the Government that is at stake, and whether there be a three-line whip, a two-line whip, or no whip at all, a vote against the Government on this occasion must, after the position taken up by the right hon. Gentleman, be a vote of want of confidence. It must be clear in every quarter of the House that the good faith of the Government is questioned. My right hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) was good enough to say that he did not distrust my good faith; it was my judgment that he distrusted. I am rather inclined to say, tu quoque. Still we come back to the same point. It does not matter whether you mistrust the Government because you mistrust their good faith or because you mistrust their judgment; the question is whether you trust the Government or distrust the Government. If you distrust them, and show it by your vote, very well; it is a vote of no confidence in the Government, and no confidence in the Prime Minister in particular. That is all I want to say on that point.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);238;It would be three weeks nearer the time, I agree. There were some warning words in the official communiqueé from Moscow which perhaps the hon. Gentleman may not have read, and, in view of that, it is quite clear that in their opinion it would not be wise  to be too optimistic about reaching a very speedy conclusion. Then there was the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Amery), that perhaps the matter would be cleared up if the two illustrations which I had given as to the circumstances which might lead me to recommend Mr. Speaker to call the House together were to be supplemented by saying that there were other conceivable circumstances in which the House might be called together. He went on to make what I thought was a more questionable suggestion, namely, that I should give an assurance that I would listen favourably to any request from the Opposition that the House should be called together. That would not at all suit the Leader of the Opposition, because he said that the responsibility lay here, and that this was the only place where it ought to lie. With that I thoroughly agree. But if I were to say that I would call the House together on the demand of the Opposition, the responsibility would no longer lie here, but across the Floor of the House with hon. Gentlemen opposite.

1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);78;I sympathise with my right hon. Friend's sorrow, but in this matter we are not considering personal feelings; we have to consider what, in the terms of the Motion, is the public interest. Let me say that in the long run that is the consideration which overrides everything else, and that is the consideration which, to the best of the judgment that the Government can exercise, must control the time at which the House would be called together.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);92;Or earlier than that. The suggestion was that Parliament could have so altered affairs in Europe that the independence of Czechoslovakia could ultimately have been preserved. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness (Sir A. Sinclair) went further still. He said that if Parliament had been summoned we could have mobilised the Fleet and made an agreement with Russia, which would have saved Czecho-Slovakia. I am not going to make any comment on that suggestion by the right hon. Gentleman; I am just going to leave it in its full beauty.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);42;The right hon.

1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);252;It is perfectly clear, if one takes the Amendment of the Opposition as it stands, that it is completely without reasonable foundation. No one could possibly say that there is any reason to pick out a particular date in August and say that that would be a suitable date for the meeting of Parliament. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping said that it would be a splendid thing to have this date up our sleeve. That seems to me a singularly unfortunate description of a procedure which would tie us down to this date. I claim that the procedure which we are proposing and which has been followed on other occasions, is the procedure which would enable us to have a Debate up our sleeve, and keep it up our sleeve until there is reason to bring it down again. I put it to the House that the Amendment of the right hon. Gentleman opposite is inconsistent with its avowed purpose, that it has no logical foundation, and that, on account of the reasons which he has given to the House for adopting it, namely, that it is moved because of the distrust of the party opposite with the Government in general, and with the Prime Minister in particular—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]—which is endorsed, at any rate, by some of the backbenchers opposite—the Amendment is reduced merely to another form of the usual vote of no confidence in the Government, and I confidently expect my hon. Friends to defeat it.

It was given in that officialese which is not meant to give any information at all, but to provide a certain pabulum of words. We shall, naturally, not attempt to form any opinion on the statement which has just been made, at this moment. We should like to have a little time to consider it, and perhaps an announcement can be made on Monday, after discussions have taken place through the usual channels, as to whether a Debate should be arranged on the subject or not.

As he is aware, a debate took place on the Motion for the Adjournment on 15th November, when the hon. Member for Luton (Dr. Hill) raised the question of the decision of the Durham County Council to dismiss any employees who were not members of a trade union. In reply, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health indicated that he would draw the attention of the council to a Ministry of Health circular issued by this  Department which was in conflict with this decision. It is now reported that the Durham County Council intend to adhere to their decision. This raises the urgent question of whether the employees of the Durham County Council may not be, at this moment, under pressure to join a union against their will. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman when we can have a statement on this question?

I do not want to rob them of any credit which may belong to them. An Amendment was put down for the abolition of capital punishment. The Cabinet had to decide how this Amendment should be treated, and they decided, as a result of a sort of bargain, that it should be left to a free vote of the House. This, no doubt, appeared a convenient method of disposing of the differences of opinion which prevailed among Members of the Cabinet and in the Socialist Party.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);107;The Government were considering their own party in this matter. But it was not a proper way of dealing with a matter of this gravity, on which the Cabinet on any given occasion should have a united and collective view. We know from the Home Secretary's speech in the house that this, above all others, was in his opinion not the time to make such a change in the law, and he stated his reasons to the House in, the strongest terms. He even said that there might have been an increase in the number of murders but for the enforcement of the death penalty, and added: 
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);40;—suspending capital punishment was added to the Bill and the long-established custom of our country was suspended against the advice of the Government and especially of the Minister publicly and personally responsible.

1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);209;But experimental in relation to an entirely different set of facts. We all remember how Queen Elizabeth dealt with poetry and blank verse"—"Marry, this is something. This is rhyme! But this"—the blank verse"—"is neither rhyme nor reason." That is what we have before us now—a mere jumble of points which seem popular at the moment to deal with cases in which, to quote the Attorney-General, public opinion feels that the suspension of the death penalty involves risk—public opinion having been measured in less than a few weeks. It is a mere jumble of points which seem popular at the moment, and which have been suggested by the more recent batch of murders as recorded in the newspapers. It has been put together not with the object of making a better and more humane system of criminal justice but of getting round an awkward Cabinet or Parliamentary difficulty. The Attorney-General said it was a compromise. Confusion is not compromise. A bargain between politicians  in difficulties ought not to be the basis of our criminal law. This is an attempt, as the Attorney-General said, to steer a middle course, to steer a course of "no meaning" between the "No" of the abolitionists and the "Yes" of the mass of ordinary folk.

We all know that Law Officers in his position have to be trotted out to cover up the most difficult and unsatisfactory situations into which Governments get. I have often seen it done, but never have I seen it done with such an undue parading of his own particular opinion on a matter upon which a great profession could form its own judgment.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);72;I take full responsibility for everything I say. The jury will have  to be instructed and will have to decide whether a killing was in the course of or in connection with the offences described in Subsection (1, a) of the Clause or whether it was for any of the specified purposes in Subsection (1, b), or whether it was in the case of poisoning by systematic administration under Subsection (1, c).
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);50;Well, the Government will have an opportunity of speaking. The Home Secretary can say what it is. I am told by people who have studied this and have great professional attainments that what I have just said is correct because the jury will in many cases have to be advised—
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);159;The right hon. and learned Gentleman may shake his head till he shakes it off, but it does not affect the argument. Intense difficulty will occur in the case of a murder alleged to have happened during a rape. I am advised that the judge would have to direct the jury first as to constructive malice under the law as it is at present—that is to say, the malice that is implied from death resulting from a felony involving violence—and secondly, express malice under the law introduced by the Amendment—that is to say, an intention to kill or maim by an act which might reasonably be expected to endanger life. If that is not correct, when the Home Secretary or any other person of authority winds up, no doubt we shall be told, but it is not much good the Government proclaiming facts which are not correct in regard to the existing interpretation of the law of the land.

1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);113;I really would not say anything more controversial than that the Home Secretary would have the power to answer these points and let us know  the view of the Government on them. If I am told that the defence of the ravisher in this case could be that he did not intend to use more force than was necessary to make the unfortunate woman submit to his approaches, is he then to escape the supreme penalty because there is no proved intention to kill or maim? All those points, I am assured, will have to be put to ordinary jurymen and jury-women who have never before been called upon to split such hairs.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);138;Ordinary jurymen and jurywomen who have never been called upon to split such hairs will now have to do it for the first time with a human life at stake. This Clause will in consequence give rise to endless legal arguments both before the judge and in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The result will be to make it more likely that certain categories of murderers will be hanged while other categories, equally heinous, cannot be. Secondly, it must tend in the long run to hamper the Home Secretary or some other Home Secretary in the exercise of his unlimited discretion which is by far, the most elastic, sympathetic and comprehending process that can possibly be used. But it is the ordeal to which juries will be subjected on which the main weight of the practical case rests.

It was discussed with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and Lord President of the Council and he entirely agreed with the arrangement that was made. He agreed to it because he is not a self-seeking man and always tries to play the game and do the best he can, which is very much to his honour. I shall always assert that—except at times when we have special questions of difference.
1945-3-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-3-22;San Francisco Conference (United Kingdom Delegation);17;I think that whatever happens we ought to keep it going until after the San Francisco Conference.

Gentleman. He has done everything in his power to break up this Government. He hopes to gain after its dissolution what he would never gain while national affairs dominated men's minds. Any fair-minded man would say that the Labour Party have had fair representation in this Government.

The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) said so just now. [Interruption.] People have a right to live even if they do not agree with the hon. Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell). A large proportion, three Labour Members, will be there, and I must say that I think it is a churlish manner to receive an announcement of this kind, in which all my colleagues are in full agreement. I do not mean with all I have said just now, but the statement on the Delegation in which all my colleagues are agreed.

1951-5-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-29;Road Haulage Strike;44;No doubt he could if the right hon. Gentleman had given notice that he would put the question.

Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern), relating to conversations with Lord Beaverbrook. Lord Beaverbrook received in February, 1940, from the hon. Member for Shettleston for exclusive publication in his newspapers an account of the so-called Tavistock Peace Plan. A conversation followed on 5th March, 1940'. The hon. Member for Shettleston invited Lord Beaverbrook to support the Plan. A written statement seeking support and signed by Lord Tavistock was submitted on 6th March. Lord Beaverbrook replied on 8th March, 1940, as follows:

1941-6-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-25;By-Election Publication, Greenock;52;I am assured that they are untrue. The hon. Gentleman, I understand, was present at a private conversation and more than a year afterwards gave his own version of the conversation which passed. In those circumstances I should think the utmost distrust should be placed upon any statement of the hon. Gentleman's.
1941-6-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-25;By-Election Publication, Greenock;54;No Sir, I see no need at all for further inquiries. A newspaper proprietor sees all sorts of people and hears all sorts of views, because that is his business, and I suppose that from time to time he gets ill-used by inventions being put about as to what has passed at private conversations.

1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);26;I have carefully considered this matter and taken a great deal of different opinions on the subject, and the result, as I believe, has been satisfactory.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);54;The joint training of the Army and the Royal Air Force is already proceeding on a considerable  scale and is being continually extended. The aircraft of Army co-operation command, which is itself being substantially expanded, are occupied solely on such training. Squadrons of Bomber and Fighter Command are also regularly used for this purpose.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);58;Of course, this subject is capable of extensive discussion, but we have to try and find the true and proper course between, on the one hand, not having aircraft attached to the infantry, which would be a misfortune, and, on the other, keeping large masses of aircraft which are required for major purposes standing by on specialised functions.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);35;I would not say it is quite satisfactory, but it is being pressed forward with the utmost energy, in complete accord with both the Services concerned and the technical branches which are at their disposal.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);51;The whole question of air-borne troops, whether it concerns the gliders which may be attached to machines with power, whether it concerns parachute troops themselves, or whether it concerns the aircraft which are power driven and tow the gliders—all these are under one organisation and are being studied as a whole.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);66;If my hon. Friend read my statement at leisure, he will see that I go further than that. The entire  Air Force is subordinated to the purposes of the military commander; he says what he wants them to do, but naturally you must not interfere with the characteristics of a particular arm. How the purposes are carried out is a matter for the Air Officer Commanding.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);25;I should be glad to consider it, but I should not like to answer the question without having had the benefit of that process beforehand.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;224;Little more than seven weeks have passed since we rose for the summer vacation, but this short period has completely changed the face of the war in Europe. When we separated, the Anglo-American Armies were still penned in the narrow bridgehead and strip of coast from the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula to the approaches to Caen, which they had wrested from the enemy several weeks before. The Brest Peninsula was untaken, the German Army in the West was still hopeful of preventing us from striking out into the fields of France, the Battle of Normandy, which had been raging bloodily from the date of the landing, had not reached any decisive conclusion. What a transformation now meets our eyes! Not only Paris, but practically the whole of France, has been liberated as if by enchantment. Belgium has been rescued, part of Holland is already free, and the foul enemy, who for four years inflicted his cruelties and oppression upon these countries, has fled, losing perhaps 400,000 in killed and wounded and leaving in our hands nearly half a million prisoners. Besides this, there may well be 200,000 cut off in the coastal fortresses or in Holland whose destruction or capture may now be deemed highly probable. The Allied Armies have reached and in some places crossed the German frontier and the Siegfried Line.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;124;As the population has increased by 50,000,000 in the last 10 years it is evident that the famine, which was caused by military conditions last year affecting transport, is by no means representative of the administration under which the broad peninsula and triangle of India has met an increase in population exceeding the speed of any increase in any other country throughout the whole world. I think it a very remarkable fact that India has received this shelter and has been this vast harbour of peace, protected by the arms and policy of Great Britain, protected also by the care and attention of this House. In this the brave fighting races of India have at all times borne a most honourable and memorable part.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;209;When we were last assembled here I had completed a review of the military situation which, although not by any means complete or exhaustive, yet, I trust, gave the general outline of our position at the present time from the point of view of one who has special opportunities of seeing things in their broad perspective. The foreign situation has responded to military events. Never was the alliance against Germany of the three great Powers more close or more effective. Divergencies of view and interest there must necessarily be, but at no time have these been allowed to affect in any way the majestic march of events in accordance with the decisions and agreements at Teheran. One by one, in rapid succession, the satellite States have writhed or torn themselves free from the  Nazi tyranny, and, as is usual in such cases, the process has not been one from alliance with Germany to neutrality, but from alliance with Germany to war. This has taken place in Roumania and Bulgaria. Already there is fighting between the Finns and the Germans. The Germans, in acordance with their usual practice and character, are leaving a trail of burnt and blackened villages behind them, even in the land of their unhappy Finnish dupes.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;45;I did not put it quite that way. I said the world was becoming less ideological, but I did not say that ideological differences did not matter. They matter a great deal, and I hope they are being adjusted in the ranks of the Allies.

1941-2-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-2-11;Export Trade;149;As the published figures indicate, the war has necessarily limited the volume of our exports, but export trade is still of the greatest importance as an essential part of our war effort. The difficulties which confront exporters are many and complex, and it is the function of the Department of Overseas Trade to assist exporters to overcome these difficulties. This entails a heavy burden of work on the Department, and particularly its overseas officers, as is demonstrated by the fact that the number of inquiries reaching the Department is as great as before the war. The Department works in the closest collaboration with the Board of Trade and the Export Council, of which body the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade is the Vice-Chairman. Special care is taken to ensure that there is no overlapping, and no advantage would result from the amalgamation suggested by my hon. Friend.
1943-7-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-01;Inter-Allied Committee's Investigation;197;His Majesty's Government are well aware of the penetration of European industry and finance by Nazi Germany, and in particular by the Hermann Goering Trust. His Majesty's Government jointed with the other Allied Governments chiefly concerned in making a Declaration on 5th January of this year which emphasized their intention to defeat all methods of dispossession practised by the enemy Powers in territories under their occupation or control. As a result of this Declaration, the text of which is contained in Command Paper 6418, an Inter-Allied Committee of Experts was set up in London to prepare the way for further action by a study of the relevant law and by the collection of the necessary information on what the enemy has done and is still doing. The Governments of the United States of America, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, and the Governments of the European Allies are all represented on this Committee, which is assembling much valuable material. This information, together with information from other sources, including, of course, relevant reports published by the United States Office of War Information, will naturally be taken into full account in framing the future plans of the United Nations.
1944-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-2-22;War And Internationa Situation;208;This is no time for sorrow or rejoicing. It is a time for preparation, effort and resolve. The war is still going on. I have never taken the view that the end of the war in Europe is at hand, or that Hitler is about to collapse, and I have certainly given no guarantees, or even held out any expectations, that the year 1944 will see the end of the European war. Nor have I given any guarantees the other way. On the whole, my information—and I have a good deal—goes to show that Hitler and his police are still in full control, and that the Nazi party and the Generals have decided to hang together. The strength of the German Army is about 300 divisions, though many of these are substantially reduced in numbers. The fighting quality of the troops is high. The German General Staff system; which we failed to liquidate after the last war, represents an Order comprising many thousands of highly-trained officers and a school of doctrine of long, unbroken continuity. It possesses great skill, both in the handling of troops in action and in their rapid movement from place to place. The recent fighting in Italy should leave no doubt on these points.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);92;The course of events in India has been improving and is, on the whole, reassuring. The broad principles of the declaration made by His Majesty's Government which formed the basis of the Mission of the Lord Privy Seal to India, must be taken as representing the settled policy of the British Crown and Parliament. These principles stand in their full scope and integrity. No one can add anything to them, and no one can take anything away. The good offices of the Lord Privy Seal were rejected by the Indian Congress Party.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);68;This, however, does not end the matter. The Indian Congress Party does not represent all India. It does not represent the majority of the people of India. It does not even represent the Hindu masses. It is a political organisation built around a party machine and sustained by certain manufacturing and financial interests. Outside  that party and fundamentally opposed to it are the 90,000,000 Moslems in British India——
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);128;—who have their rights of self-expression; the 50,000,000 Depressed Classes, or the Untouchables as they are called because they are supposed to defile their Hindu co-religionists by their presence or by their shadow; and the 95,000,000 subjects of the Princes of India with whom we are bound by treaties; in all 235,000,000 in these three large groupings alone, out of about 390,000,000 in all India. This takes no account of large elements among the Hindus, Sikhs and Christians in British India who deplore the present policy of the Congress Party. It is necessary that these main facts should not be overlooked here or abroad, because no comprehension of the Indian problem or of the relations between Britain and India is possible without the recognition of these basic data.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);77;I have thought that the accounts in British newspapers have been very full of what has happened in India. I have endeavoured to give the House a considered statement of the facts, every one of which is established, in order to add to the information which has appeared from time to time. It is very necessary, I agree, that information of the real facts should be made public, not only here, but also in the United States.

I was about to answer his question, and I can do so by saying that up to a very late hour last night my right hon.

1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);21;I have made it perfectly clear in my statement that those proposals, which were solemnly undertaken, in their broad principles stand.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);37;I have no information which would lead to that idea, and, of course, in the present state of affairs in India, with invasion not far off, these constitutional solutions and agreements are very difficult to come to.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);154;There was a feeling in a great many quarters that the Debate on the Adjournment might prove the occasion for some reference to Indian affairs, and, no doubt, opinions will be expressed on both sides on this matter as the Chair may call Members. I entirely agree that we must look forward to an opportunity in the future, in the not distant future, for debating the general issue that is open now in India. Personally, I think that when we come back such an opportunity might well be found, though one must see what is the exact situation in that country as to whether it would be a good moment for a very extended Debate. But the Government have a perfectly plain and clear policy upon which they are united, and we are quite ready to stand any Debate or discussion which the House may wish to raise, having regard to the general interest.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);47;The reinforcements have been sent to protect the great masses of the Indian people from Japanese invasion. The fact that they are in the country undoubtedly does add to the general stability which happily prevails in India. What was the other point raised by the hon. Gentleman?
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);10;It is not within my power to improvise Parliamentary procedure.

As a matter of fact, a vote can take place only on a Resolution, and Resolutions require proper notice and so forth, but it may well be that there will be a vote when we have a full-dress Debate on India at a later period.

1941-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-3-20;Broadcasting Policy (Artistes And Technicians);117;I will answer these two Questions together. The British Broadcasting Corporation have informed me that they have reconsidered the cases of those artistes  who attended the People's Convention, and have decided that they shall not be debarred from giving performances on the broadcast in the normal way as opportunity arises. It is no part of the policy of His Majesty's Government to accord the special facilities of the microphone to persons whose words and actions are calculated to hamper the nation in its struggle for life. But the connection between this and musical and dramatic performances of all kinds, or the relation of such performances to political acts and opinions, are not apparent or worth while establishing.

The former Chancellor of the Exchequer was addressed in writing by the late Chairman, Lord Justice Cohen, who said that certain things required amplifying and clarifying, and he wrote back expressing his agreement; but no special action was taken then. On a new Chairman taking over the amendments were introduced in accordance with what had been agreed beforehand.

1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);397;I have a few words to say about the Business of the House. I am somewhat concerned at the effects produced abroad and overseas by the two days' Debate on Production. Statements that our industry is only working 75 per cent. of some unspecified standard and that the Ministry of Aircraft Production is in chaos from top to bottom tend to give a general impression in the United States and the Dominions, particularly Australia, that things are being very ill-managed here and that we are not trying our best. It is impossible for the newspapers to report our Debates except in a very abridged form, but sensational statements of this kind telegraphed all over the world do serious harm to our cause wherever they go. Moreover, they do not at all represent the immense and well-directed effort which is yielding remarkable results in almost every field of war production, and they do far from justice to the admirable tenure of the Ministry of Supply by my right hon. Friend the present President of the Board of Trade. I much regret that it was not possible for me, because of the many other things I have to do, to be present in the House except during the closing speeches of that Debate. It is obviously not possible for considered Ministerial answers to be submitted to these charges on the spur of the moment. It is not like ordinary party, peace-time fighting, when any score handed across the Table is good enough for the purposes of the occasion. These are very serious times in which we live. I have, however, read thoroughly the OFFICIAL REPORT of the two days' Debate, and I have given directions that all allegations of any serious substance shall be sent to the various Departments concerned in order that the facts may be ascertained. On the Third Sitting Day after 20th July I propose to set up the same Votes as were under discussion last  week and to have a third day's Debate, in Public Session. I will myself endeavour to make a full and comprehensive statement on the whole question of production so far as the public interest permits. I hope by this means, which is inspired by the greatest possible respect for the House, to remove any mistaken and evil impression which may be doing us harm in any part of the world.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);38;I propose to have a third day's Debate and to initiate the Debate myself, and it will then be open for anyone to take up the quarrel, if they think there is any public advantage in so doing.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);163;I do not mind, but when statements are made affecting the whole of our production, and the character of our production, perhaps an hour or two before the end of the Debate, it is quite impossible for Ministers to do justice to them in their answers. If we were engaged in ordinary party politics it would be quite easy to throw cheap scores across the House, to the gratification of the supporters of a Government who are in a majority; but in time of war time for the preparation of a much more reasoned answer is required. Grave consideration has to be given not only to the actual facts but to what part of those facts can be stated in public, and in what form  they can be stated in public, and I certainly could not undertake to answer all the charges that are made in the course of a Debate without having the opportunity of considering the matter maturely and comprehensively beforehand.

I do not see why we should evade. We neither need to evade nor to shrink from dividing if necessary and we are perfectly capable of defending ourselves, but in a time of war when the affairs of the country are very complicated, and when enormous business is divided among a great number of Ministers, it is not possible to give the same answers on every topic that is raised as could be done when the ordinary party fight was in progress. Every prominent politician on both sides is well acquainted with that fact.

I am sure they will not use those powers in any aggressive way. Like Great Britain, they have no need for territorial gain. Personally, I feel it must be in most men's minds here today that it is a matter for rejoicing that these powers of manufacture are in such good hands. The possession of these powers will help the United States and our Allies to build  up the structure of world security. It may be the necessary lever which is required to build up that great structure of world security.

I am not making any attack. I only say that it occurred to me to be quite clear from what he said that there has been somewhere a breach of confidence, which he published and brought to the notice of the House in the exercise of his responsibilities as a Member of Parliament. This, of course, was immediately telegraphed to the United States, and at the Press Conference the next day President Truman was questioned about it. A truncated  report appeared in some of the newspapers here, with the answers which he gave, but not setting forth the exact question which elicited the answer. I have taken pains to verify the actual text of the answers which President Truman gave at his Press Conference on 31st October. He was asked by correspondents the following question:

1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);64;My information does not suggest that security officers require further powers; and, in view of the wide variety of establishments to which the hon. Gentleman refers, I doubt whether it would be practicable or desirable to impose a greater uniformity of  practice. I am, however, asking the Ministers responsible to give special attention to the need for vigilance regarding the security of these establishments.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);14;Yes, Sir, I am doing my best to ensure that that shall not happen.

1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);98;My point is a matter of wording. I should like to ask The Prime Minister whether, in answering this Question, he is treating the word "screening" as meaning "sifting" or as meaning "sheltering," because there is a great difference between the two. I looked it up in the dictionary, and I was astonished to find that though "sheltering" is the normal sense of the word, there is, dating from the 17th century, one example of "screening" being used in the sense of "sifting"; but it is important that we should clear up the interpretation of this hard-worked word.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);28;It seems that in the process of recent years we must have returned to the 17th century interpretation of the word. That is how it is used today.

1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);2;No, Sir.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);74;Because at a certain time there has been what has been called "screening" in the case of a person engaged in high security work, it does not mean that care is not taken thereafter from time to time to follow up any possible danger. I should not like it to be thought that necessarily because someone had been "screened" at a certain time, no steps are taken thereafter. They are, from time to time.

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;93;Yes, Sir. The proposals which the Government have had under their consideration refer to two classes of aircraft. The first class includes all aircraft borne in ships of the Royal Navy. These are known as the Fleet Air Arm. They are under the operational control of the Admiralty, but as part of the Royal Air Force they are under the administrative control of the Air Ministry. The second class includes shore-based aircraft employed in co-operation with naval forces. These are under the operational as well as the administrative control of the Air Ministry.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;63;Was it not possible for the Prime Minister to arrange to make this statement to the House at a time when we could have discussed it? The whole question of the co-ordination of Defence was debated last Monday, and in view of the length of time which these proceedings have taken, is it only just to-day that a decision has been come to?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;66;I regret as much as the right hon. Gentleman that it was not possible to come to a decision before. Of course, if we had we should have given the House an opportunity of discussing it. I can assure the right hon.

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;65;The question of training is one which will have to be worked out by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry in co-operation with one another, and at the present we have not attempted to define the exact lines of agreement.

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;23;That is another point which, obviously, must be decided by the two Departments after they have had an opportunity of considering the matter.

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;75;Again, that is a matter for the Admiralty and the Air Force to consider what is the best plan. I should imagine, for example, that it might be that the Admiralty would have a portion of an aerodrome which is now under the Air Force, and that in another case they might have an aerodrome entirely on their own. I do not think we can say exactly what the decision will be at this moment.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;9;But in principle that is so, is it not?

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;84;That is what I have said. The broad principle has been determined, but a great many details have to be settled, and I have every reason to suppose that they will be settled amicably by co-operation between the Admiralty and the Air Force. There is no reason why hon. Members should not raise this question on the Motion for the Adjournment, and if they do I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence will be present.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;68;Is it the view of the Prime Minister that the decision come to by the Government has definitely settled this controversy, and will he use his influence to prevent it being continued as an internecine warfare between the two Departments? If it has not been settled it is no use pretending that it has, and we shall have this constant firing between the Departments over and over again.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;54;The Government decision, as taken, and now made public, is final. As far as it can settle the controversy it has settled it.

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;55;I am asking the Prime Minister whether he is going to use his authority to prevent this constant firing between the Departments which has been going on for years now to the detriment of the Services. If a decision had been come to, is he going to insist upon it being implemented by the Departments?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;63;I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman should suggest that the Departments are not loyally going to carry out this decision. I have had an assurance from both that they intend to do so, and I entirely accept that assurance. What I say is that I cannot prevent individuals over whom I have no authority firing shots if they think fit.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;19;Is the Prime Minister aware that this matter has been settled before  and reopened again and again after settlement?

My hon. Friend has dealt with many of the points which have been advanced in the Debate in a mariner which showed the serious spirit in which he has approached a study of this question. He has indulged in one or two observations the candour and honesty of which we must all greatly appreciate, and upon which I may be called upon to make some observations in the course of to-morrow's Debate. At any rate, when upon a matter which affects our hearths and homes, our lives and freedom we find the Hereditary Standard Bearer of Scotland standing up to commend the Government Measure to us, our hearts are raised to an extremely cordial sense of appreciation.

The experts whose advice is at the disposal of Her Majesty's Government see, I am informed, no reason to dissent from this opinion.

Great questions of policy like whether we should go to the aid of Greece after the Germans were driven out, are made manifest to the Dominions by the continued succession of telegrams which are sent from this country, and which give them a perfect, full picture of the situation. The executive measures which are sometimes forced to be taken with the greatest speed, owing to danger to life and limb—these measures it is not possible to refer to Governments all over the world. But they have been kept fully informed of everything that happens as it goes forward, and the Dominions Secretary informs me that I could rightfully say that we have received from the Dominion Governments no indications that they dissent from the action we have been compelled to take.

It is not generally possible to distinguish in the trade returns between exports which have been licensed and those which do not require a licence. Licences have, however, been issued in the last three months for the export to China of about £6,800 of dyestuffs and about £1,250 of other commodities. Licensing arrangements vary considerably from one British Colonial Territory to another.

1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;19;It might or might not be. We have in fact an absolute prohibition at the present time on rubber.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;8;I could not answer that question without notice.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;78;I did not blame the hon. Member. I only pointed out that he laboured under a certain misapprehension because of the width of the categories on which the Board of Trade terms are based. Iron and steel manufactures include products from normally finished steel to things like wire mattresses, nails, tacks, rivets, manhole covers and a whole range of very minor matters, and I think there was a distinct misapprehension owing to the categories in the reply given.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;2;None whatever.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;76;The matter of economic sanctions is still under consideration by the United Nations. Natural rubber was not included in the prohibited and restricted lists originally owing to the great difficulty of control by export licensing, but in the first months of this year it was restricted by administrative action, and since then there have been stricter limitations. That was done in  agreement with the United States of America and finally, in April, there was complete prohibition.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;43;I have not exact information as to what particular categories came under these vehicles. They include locomotives and ships and a very wide range of things and, as I say, bicycles. I do not know the amount for which the hon. Member asks.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;90;I will certainly do it if it is possible. It means very great examination of all the Customs returns and, remember, it means checking up on licences which were given months ago and which have not been brought forward. There is no intention whatever of excluding from the House any knowledge it ought to have, but I think people ought not to suggest by any manner of means, that what has gone from here has been used against our men, because everybody knows the sources of the Chinese army's supplies.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;19;That is rather a different question. I have endeavoured to give the right hon. Gentleman the fullest answer today.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;71;May I make a correction to a statement I made just now? I think I may have overstated the matter. With regard to the exports of rubber, they have been subject to export licensing since 9th April to prevent undue and enlarged quantities being sent to any particular destination. But there has not been, and cannot be I think, an absolute prohibition to see that no rubber whatever gets to China.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;66;It is a question of degree—how much is strategic. As I understand it, it is a matter which has been done in agreement with the Americans. It is really a question of quantities. Obviously large quantities would amount to strategic supplies, but a very small quantity of rubber for particular purposes would not. I understand that is how it is dealt with under the export licensing.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;13;I am not aware of that. I could not answer that without notice.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;24;That is a question which might be put to the President of the Board of Trade. I will try to give the detailed figures.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;43;I understand the Prime Minister to say that at any rate from now on, the policy in regard to the export of strategic materials will be in full accord, not only on rubber but in other matters, with that of the United States?
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;17;Yes, Sir. That is what I am saying. This was done in accord with the United States.

Gentleman how it was that the usual channels were not informed beforehand of his intention to make a statement of that character late last night; and how it was that full information was given to all his supporters, including the Prime Minister and others, whereas the Conservative Party, and I believe the Liberal Party, were not at all informed that any statement of that kind was to be made? Having regard to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman's statement was intended to be of a conciliatory or deprecatory character, surely it would have been better to extend the usual courtesies.

But may I say to the right hon. Gentleman that I am not at all sure that ordinary discussion through the usual channels will deal with the matter of grave constitutional importance which he has raised. I think it would be better if the discussion took place between himself and me; or himself and some other colleague, and me and another colleague. I do not consider that this is a matter for settlement, as it were, through the two Whips' rooms, excellent and admirable as are their representatives on  both sides. But of course I should be quite ready to receive the right hon. Gentleman—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—my room is on the ground floor anyhow. If there is any point to be made of it we could, of course, meet on neutral ground—accompanied by seconds—to have a discussion on this matter. Certainly it would be very wrong that anybody on either side should refrain from or refuse fully to discuss these matters. Perhaps the point of how, and where and when such a discussion should take place might well be relegated to the usual channels; while the merits and the general decision must be done on a different—I must not say higher—but a different level from that.

I have the greatest respect for the Chair—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—and I believe that I shall be accorded the rights which anybody else in my position would have been accorded in former Parliaments. I ask, is not it an obstacle to the beginning of these talks—I quite agree I should put it in interrogative form—that a threat should be used of maltreating, contrary to the merits of their cases, the traders of many different classes in this country as a means of putting pressure on Members of the House of Commons to refuse them their Parliamentary rights and privileges long established by practice and custom of this House? And how does the right hon. Gentleman reconcile such a situation—I am asking  the question—with the proposal for friendly conversations—personally friendly and on general grounds I trust—which the right hon. Gentleman has come to us asking us to begin?

MEMBERS: "Oh."]—of the President of the Board of Trade, as I said, to subject to great hardship large and important sections of manufacturers and others in the country, by denying them their rights and treating them severely, is withdrawn. I do not propose that we should enter into any conversations of a friendly character—[Interruption.]—I do not fear hon. Gentlemen opposite half as much as they fear their fellow countrymen. I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether we can have a withdrawal by the President of the Board of Trade as a prelude to this conversation——
1951-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-20;Motions To Annul Orders (Procedure);91;This is really a serious matter. [Interruption.] Is not this really a serious matter, and would it not be a great disadvantage to the House if the possibilities of friendly personal contact came to an end? May I hope that I shall hear from the right hon. Gentleman in the course of the afternoon—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO."]—that I shall hear from him before he expects me to meet him, with or without companions? I hope I shall hear from him that the President of the Board of Trade has withdrawn his threat.

But, after all, this Vote of Censure has been on the Order Paper for some time, and it has been flashed all over the world. When I was in the United States, I can testify to the lively excitement which was created by its appearance, and, although we in this country may have our own knowledge of the stability of our institutions and of the strength of the Government of the day, yet that is by no means the opinion which is shared or felt in other countries. Now that this has gone so far, and this matter has been for more than a week the subject of comment in every part of the world, it would be, in my opinion, even more injurious to delay a decision than to go forward with this issue.

With your consent, Mr. Speaker, and the consent of the House, I am prepared forthwith to nominate hon. Members to serve on the Committee. I am aware that notice is normally required of Motions to nominate members of Committees, but I hope that it will be possible on this occasion to waive this requirement with the consent of the House. Perhaps I should inform the House that the hon. Members whom it is proposed to appoint have been approached and express their willingness to serve on the Committee.

With regard to what the right hon. Gentleman said as to the alteration of procedure, we are, of course, in the hands of Mr. Speaker, but on this side of the House we have a strong feeling that this matter should be disposed of as quickly as possible in the interests of all concerned.

Gentleman did not on this occasion unduly stress disagreement and, in the concluding part of his speech, he said that everybody would agree with what he understood to be the main aim of the Government. I think that must be so. I cannot imagine anyone in any part of the House who would disagree with what we have so frequently declared to be the main aim of the Government's foreign policy, namely, the establishment and the maintenance of peace and the removal, as far as that may be practicable, of all causes of possible conflict in the amelioration of grievances between one country and another.

Perhaps, however, the House might like to have the latest information about the communications which have been passing between His Majesty's Government and the Burgos authorities about the bombing of British ships in Spanish ports. We sent a communication to the Burgos authorities, who have, the House will remember, declared that it was no part of their policy to make deliberate attacks upon British ships. We sent a communication to them proposing that an immediate investigation should be made into certain cases to which we had already drawn their attention, and in which it appeared to us that the attack  had been, in fact, a deliberate one. We proposed that this investigation should be carried out by two naval officers, one appointed by His Majesty's Government and the other by the Burgos authorities. If they agreed that the attack was deliberate, then the Burgos authorities would make the necessary arrangements to pay immediate compensation to those concerned. If, on the other hand, the two officers were unable to agree, then our proposal was that the matter should be referred to a third party, not of British or Spanish nationality, but who should be agreed upon between the Burgos authorities and ourselves, and that he should make the final decision. We have now received a reply from the Burgos authorities in which they say that, in pursuance of their desire to meet the wishes of His Majesty's Government, they accept this formula and they agree that the investigation we propose should be carried out. We are now considering whether it would not be advisable to send Sir Robert Hodgson back to Spain with instructions which would cover, among other things, the detailed working out of this proposal.

I was saying that we have fulfilled our engagement to take steps at the Council of the League to clarify the position of Member States in regard to the Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia. The right hon. Gentleman stated that the recruiting of Somalis by the Italian forces was taking place in British Somaliland. My information is that he is mistaken.

I was saying that we cannot abandon the position we have taken up in regard to the settlement of the Spanish question which we have over and over again declared to the House. But, on the other hand, we profoundly regret this unforeseen delay which has taken place in the completion of the agreement, and we shall do all that we possibly can to facilitate the withdrawal of the foreign volunteers from Spain, in order that that country may cease to offer any threat to the peace of Europe.

We have noted with satisfaction the efforts which the Czech Government have made, and we have also been very happy to receive assurances, only recently renewed, from the German Government of their own desire for a peaceful solution. The right hon. Gentleman asked me what asurances I had given to the German Ambassador. I was not myself responsible for the exact wording of the communiqué to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred; but it does not mean anything more than I have already told the House of our action in urging the Czechoslovakian Government to try to do all they possibly can, consistent with what they consider essential to their own State, to come to an agreement. On the other side, too, we have continually urged the need for patience in a very delicate and difficult situation.

1945-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-3-08;Service Personnel (Political Meetings);16;Yes, Sir. But, of course, if they were in civilian clothes it might not be noticed.
1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;213;I do not wish to raise a long debate on this Motion. Everybody realises the great strain there has been on the Prime Minister and that he needs a rest, but there are other Ministers beside the Prime Minister, and I think it is important that this House should be kept in Session. The events that are proceeding in Central Europe to-day are being followed with great anxiety by this country, and with increasing disturbance of mind as reports come through. It is a mistake that this House should depart while matters are in such jeopardy, and it is desirable that we should keep the closest watch on events and get the fullest amount of information. I think that this House, although it may be tired, should have regard to the fact that it has its responsibilities and that we have taken on new responsibilities, whether by the guarantee which is to be embodied in a treaty, or whether under what we may call the moral guarantee which has been assumed on behalf of this country by the Prime Minister, and we ought to be here and watchful, doing our business. There is plenty of business to be done. While the Prime Minister is having his rest the House should continue to sit.
1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;231;May I add my plea to the Prime Minister that he will consider the very reasonable request of the Leader of the Liberal party that we should go away for ten days and meet on the 18th for a day or two? After all, we are passing through a period of very rapid daily change in Europe of the most disturbing character, and it does not seem quite right that Parliament should go away for 25 days as if nothing was going on and as if it had lost interest in matters which affect the whole future of this country. It is derogatory to Parliament, it seems to me, that it should be thought unfit as it were to be attending to these grave matters, that it should be sent away upon a holiday in one of the most formidable periods through which we have lived. I know that there is a certain under-current of derision of Parliament even among its own Members, and a feeling no doubt among Ministers "What relief it will be when we have got them sent about their business and we can get on with our work." That is exactly the idea which in other countries has led to the institution of dictatorships, the same process of impatience with the parliamentary machine which has swept it away and has led to its replacement by one-man rule.
1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;215;It will be remembered that the original plea of the Leader of the Opposition was that Parliament should continue to sit and that it was based on four considerations which he put to me. I gave him an answer to those four questions. It was to the effect that I did not think any of them could reasonably be discussed in the immediate present. The request to-day has been put to me on entirely different grounds. Let me say first of all that I have not asked that the House should rise now and not sit again till 1st November on the plea that I wanted a rest. I am not so exhausted that I cannot carry out my duties, whatever they may be. I do not pretend that I am not as fond of a holiday as anyone else. But on this matter, this suggestion that in the next fortnight or three weeks something might happen which is of importance and which this House should have an opportunity of speaking its mind upon—upon that hypothesis I do ask hon. Members to look at the terms of the Motion. The Motion provides for the usual procedure, under which the House can be summoned by Mr. Speaker to meet again if such a situation should arise.

1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;179;I will tell my right hon. Friend exactly what I think was unworthy of him. It was not his question just now but the suggestion that he made a few moments ago that Cabinet Ministers would be glad to see the House dispersed in order that they might get on with their business instead of having to face the House. A repetition of tittle-tattle about the way in which Cabinet business is conducted is not doing justice to the sincerity and to the sense of responsibility of Cabinet Ministers. It is true that the House can be called together only on a representation to Mr. Speaker by His Majesty's Government, but that is not to say that we are not fully conscious of the gravity of the times and that we are not fully prepared at any moment, if in our judgment the situation requires it, to give up our holiday and to return at once and answer to the House for anything that we might do. That, really, is a sufficient safeguard for those Members of the House

I should be very ready to put the question down in a different form, possibly asking for three totals. All we want to know is how many men are being kept here and in the Far East. That is the main fact. One must see where the greatest numbers  lie. That is all I am anxious to adduce. I should be very glad to have a talk with my right hon. Friend afterwards, and to put another Question to him. [Interruption.] An hon. Member asks why I want to know. It is because I want to get the largest number of men out of the Army as soon as possible.

1954-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-6-24;Members' Expenses (Government Decision);110;We have heard with very great regret the statement of the Prime Minister. While there is the technical point about the need for a Government Resolution on a matter involving finance, it has been the practice to accept the decision of the House of Commons. During the time of the Government of which I was Prime Minister, there were two outstanding occasions. One was the suspension of a Member and the other was the question of capital punishment. In both those cases the House took a view contrary to that held by the Government, but the Government felt in duty bound to accept the opinion of the House of Commons.

Gentleman, but neither of them touches the financial question, and therefore the constitutional points which I have put did not arise. There is a definite distinction in the character of the questions. Moreover, if my recollection serves me rightly, no further action was required from the executive Government of the day in consequence of the two votes passed by the House in the cases which the right hon.  Gentleman has mentioned. Events merely rolled upon their course. In this case, definite, responsible, constructive action involving a charge upon the public is called for from the Government.

Members of several parties in Opposition time. We had no power to prevent it. It was the right of Members of all parties to put it down, and personally I was very much in favour of a free vote being given on the subject, but that does not remove the fact that the Government of the day, representing the Crown in the matter, have the constitutional responsibility for any proposal involving a charge upon the public, and an expression of opinion by the House does not relieve them of their responsibility.
1954-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-6-24;Members' Expenses (Government Decision);82;The right hon. Gentleman will remember that it was as a matter of courtesy that the Opposition provided a Supply Day for the purpose of discussing the Report by a Committee set up by this House—an important Committee representative of Members on both sides—to deal with this matter, and that there was, therefore, an obligation on the Government to give time to discuss the Report. It was purely a matter of courtesy that we allowed it to be taken in our time.

I think that it would be better that he should discuss the matter with his friends, and then give the decision at which he arrives.

I must say that I was astonished to see the state of the House during the Debate this afternoon. My mind goes back to the days before the War when the Navy Estimates were debated in a House which was crowded to the utmost capacity. I have been looking up the Debate of 1913. I see that owing to a political quarrel we did not begin the discussion until 7.30 and the House sat right on through dinner up to eleven o'clock. It may be that hon. Members feel more reassured in their minds about the position of the Navy than they did in those days, or it may possibly be that the fibre of post-war Parliamentary representatives is not up to what it was in the days of old, though perhaps it is discourteous to present such a suggestion otherwise than in the form of an alternative.

Broadly speaking, I venture to say that the course of events this year has done nothing to weaken our confidence in the judgment of the naval experts that great ships of war can be constructed which can exercise their full influence and efficiency under modern conditions, and that the air menace, however seriously it may operate in other directions, will not destroy the validity of sea power.

I gather from him that all the recognised machinery of trade union negotiation was in full operation, and that this was a breakaway unofficial strike, but the Question I really addressed to the right hon. Gentleman dealt rather with the responsibility of the Government for maintaining the services of the House. It is not suitable that the House of Commons and the House of Lords, where the affairs of the whole country have to be dealt with, should be deprived of what are considered to be the regular normal services of this House, and I should like to know what steps the Government propose to take to make sure that these services are resumed at the earliest moment.

Is it definitely established that every statutory interference with an execution—every administrative interference with an execution—involves the Royal Prerogative? Are not respites frequently given from week to week when cases have to be considered; and was there not a case only last week, or the week before, of a respite being given for a considerable time by administrative authority? What has that to do with the Royal Prerogative which is involved in the case where a final or formal pardon is concerned? Might I ask for your Ruling, Sir, as between the two quite definite classes of action by which the execution of human beings is stayed?

If that were so, would your objection to a Motion for the Adjournment of the House being moved by the hon. Member for Oldham still stand—if it be true that there are cases, and that this is one of those cases where the Royal Prerogative is not invoked, but only the Ministerial responsibility?

His power over their actions may not be absolute, but he can suspend a Governor from his functions. If there is no other way of gaining the time, he should certainly consider that. I have been concerned in these matters over a great many years. Is not this an exhibition of impotence on the part of the head of a great Department that he does not wish men to be executed, yet he does not know whether they will be or not, and says he has no means of sending word from Britain to one of his own officials, an appointed Governor? Is not that a shocking thing? May I ask you, Mr. Speaker, most respectfully, whether you will not give fresh consideration to the request for leave to move the Adjournment submitted by the hon.

Gentleman's question. We are going to have a debate on Monday next, and I think all these points can be much better ventilated then than they can by Question and answer across the Floor of the House.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;42;I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman will have the good fortune to catch your eye on Monday, Mr. Speaker. If he does, I am sure he will be sorry that he is giving so much of his speech away beforehand.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;13;The procedure of Question and answer is superseded by a full day's debate.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;57;I am offering the House the very great and full advantage of a debate on the whole subject. This in no way derogates from the duty of answering Questions, but I thought that on the whole it would be in the general interest if these Questions, instead of being answered specifically today, were reserved for the debate.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;87;Is not the Prime Minister introducing an entirely new practice into this House in suggesting that, because there is to be a future debate, Ministers should be excused from answering Questions? In my experience there have always been numbers of Questions put to Ministers in anticipation of bringing out the points to be raised in debate. Surely it would be a bad thing for someone to say that because we have a debate on, say, the Army Estimates a fortnight hence, he will not answer any Questions?
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;57;I gladly concede the Parliamentary principle invoked by the Leader of the Opposition. I only thought that on this occasion it would be more in accordance with the wishes of the House—the answers were of a limited and negative character [HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—to have a general statement and the promise of an opportunity of a full debate.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;60;I am certainly giving, and the other Members of the Government concerned are giving, their close attention to the question of London. I see that the Leader of the victorious Socialist Party in London is also giving his attention to it, since he is very much concerned about the rise in fares resulting from the administration of the party opposite.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;5;That is a big question.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;6;Yes, I have read the report—
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;118;Oh, yes, I am sure I had. As to the very much larger question of whether rail services should be subsidised, that overlooks the fact that for the last three or four years they have been subsidised—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] They have been subsidised, in fact if not in form, by accumulating a deficit which grows year by year, which deficit is presented only as a matter of book-keeping. It is really a part of the national finances. However, the question of the railways and how they should be enabled to become self-supporting and in proper and true relation with an ever-growing road transport service, is one which might well be ventilated in the debate promised for next Monday.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;43;I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are anxious to do our utmost to protect Londoners, as far as it is possible within the law or within our finances, from the evil consequences they are suffering from the hands of his party.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;10;My hon. Friend will, I am sure, have ample opportunities—
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;25;of giving vent to his feelings and testifying by actions, which are louder than words, not only in the debate but in the Division Lobby.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;9;All that will fit very well into the debate.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;62;I am ashamed to admit that no final decision has yet been taken on that point. However, it would seem to me convenient if we framed a Motion in such a way as—[An HON. MEMBER: "To blame us."]—to enable the party opposite, who are so resolute for the increases in fares, to give a vote in the Lobby when the occasion comes.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;58;I think it is usual for Governments to have the right and option of decision as to how they will dispose of their speakers in particular debates. I have been led to take a great interest in this question, but I think I would prefer to reserve any decision upon this subject until I see how things go.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;36;I think there ought to be a Motion, and that Motion would be moved, and the speech moving it would give rise to a reply—in fact the debate would proceed in very much the ordinary manner.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;13;I think that question should be addressed to the Leader of the House.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;46;Nothing could be better than for the hon. and learned Gentleman to unfold his case in the debate on Monday. I hope I shall not be doing him any injustice if I tell him that my expert information is that he is wrong on both points.

Until the number of British subjects required by such international agencies can be more accurately assessed, His Majesty's Government consider it inadvisable to initiate training schemes which would interfere with the war-time occupation of the candidates.

1950-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-10-24;Motion For Address In Reply;17;Mr. Speaker, I rise to move an Address in reply to His Majesty's Gracious Message as follows: 
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;95;An answer to this Question would depend on an accurate assessment of a variety of immeasurables. I am advised that from our present knowledge the number of major experimental explosions required to produce lethal risks over an area beyond that immediately affected by the explosion would be very large indeed. On the most cautious assumptions it would be, so I am advised, considerably greater than the number which could conceivably be employed in any tests likely to be made by the Powers who possess these weapons. Investigation into this problem is proceeding actively and continuously.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;16;I have not had an opportunity of verifying the quotation to which the hon. Member refers.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;17;I do not think it would be within my power to take a decision of that kind.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;80;There have been a number of experiments of which record has reached us of explosions in Russia, and then there were those which took place a year ago under the authority of the United States. But it is one thing to form a view about what would be the most agreeable course to be pursued in these matters by either of these two countries and quite another thing to persuade them, still more to compel them, not to have tests.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;53;I am sure that it would have been a very good thing if none of these things had ever been discovered at all. At what stage in their discovery they should be arrested, and with what advantage to particular nations that are experimenting in them, is a much more complicated question to decide.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;85;We have a great deal of information on this extremely complex question and we are continuing  to pursue our researches intensively. As the hon. Member will now be aware, Her Majesty's Government, together with others, have proposed that an international conference of scientists on atomic energy be organised during the coming summer, and a resolution to this effect is now under discussion in the Political Committee of the United Nations. This conference will doubtless consider, among other matters, the effects of radiation on human beings.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;28;I am quite sure that all the information which is available here and in the United States on such aspects is at the disposal of our expert authorities.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;22;I should like to see what they were before I even imagined that I had the authority to decide such a question.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;63;The hon. and learned Gentleman might, with all his eloquence and learning, go to both the Americans and the Russians—[An HON. MEMBER: "The right hon.

1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);10;Would the right hon. Gentleman rather I did not speak?
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);7;What was the date of the letter?
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);34;The letter was written after the White Paper was published? That was only a few days ago. Very often it is courteous to send a formal acknowledgment pending a more reasoned reply later on.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);67;I am very glad to hear any reassurances of that kind, and I am willing to accept them for what they are worth. But we should certainly not be afraid to join issue with the party opposite on this ground. If the threat or act of public duty were taken seriously it would, of course, affect the value of the national property which we propose to sell.

1947-2-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-06;Industrial Fuel And Power Needs;60;On a point of Order. I presume that as we are now to have a Debate on the Adjournment, hon. Members are perfectly free to raise such topics as they choose if they are fortunate enough to catch your eye? Therefore, this matter would be quite relevant to the Debate we are to take this afternoon if hon. Members choose?
1949-1-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-20;Newspaper Article (Minister's Statement);25;It is quite clear from the statement which the Minister has volunteered that the onus in this matter lies very directly upon the newspaper concerned.
1945-3-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1945-3-28;Earl Lloyd-George Of Dwyfor, Om;186;Mr. Speaker, shortly after David Lloyd George first took Cabinet office as President of the Board of Trade, the Liberals who had been in eclipse for 20 years obtained in January, 1906, an overwhelming majority over all other parties. They were independent of the Irish; the Labour Party was in its infancy; the Conservatives were reduced to little more than 100. But this moment of political triumph occurred in a period when the aspirations of 19th century Liberalism had been largely achieved. Most of the great movements and principles of Liberalism had become the common property of enlightened men all over the civilised world. The chains had been struck from the slave; a free career was open to talent; the extension of the franchise was moving irresistibly forward; the advance in education was rapid and continuous, not only in this island but in many lands. Thus at the moment when the Liberal Party became supreme, the great and beneficent impulses which had urged them forward were largely assuaged by success. Some new and potent conception had to be found by those who were called into power.

1942-9-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-29;Madagascar (Operations);7;I think the resistance was mainly symbolic.
1951-6-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-07;Division No 86 (Incident);123;We naturally accept and support the report which you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, have made upon this matter and I was very glad to hear the remarks which were made in such a becoming strain by the Leader of the  House. From the information which has reached me, it appears that several Ministers of high standing and importance in the Government took an active part in those proceedings. I am not mentioning their names because of the terms of the remarks by the Leader of the House, but it does appear they did take a part and I trust we may assume they are included among those who have apologised to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East for their unparliamentary and improper behaviour.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);22;Yes, Sir. I am glad to take this opportunity of explaining the position of Members of Parliament under the National Service Acts.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);12;I think I can safely reassure my hon. Friend on that point.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);36;I do not think the question is one of favour, but rather of the discharge of important duties. Those duties, as I have several times pointed out, are sometimes better discharged by silence than by speech.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);18;Some people, by their absence, contribute as much to the progress of our affairs as by their presence.
1943-4-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-13;British Empire (Economic Policy);54;It is, of course, the established policy to maintain the closest co-operation and contact with the Governments of the Empire on all economic questions of common concern. Having regard, however, to the responsibility which must rest with the respective Governments and Parliaments, a centralized executive body such as that suggested would not be practicable.
1944-3-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-3-30;Clause 82—(Remuneration Of Teachers);31;I thought that the Noble Lord was addressing the whole Committee and not particularly addressing me.

1944-3-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-30;Clause 82—(Remuneration Of Teachers);19;If I should find myself in that position, I would gladly give an answer to my right hon. Friend.
1944-3-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-30;Clause 82—(Remuneration Of Teachers);25;The hon. Gentleman should not talk about backwoodsmen. Many hon. Members on the back benches are doing public work and are often in the Services.
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 27—(Effect Of Capitalisation Of Profits On Rate Of Profits Tax);58;This frivolous performance gave me the strange impression, perhaps not altogether inappropriate to the hour at which we are sitting, that we were listening to a sleep-talker. I would ask the Leader of the House to reply to the request that has been formally made to him by my right hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton).
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 27—(Effect Of Capitalisation Of Profits On Rate Of Profits Tax);84;Might not the House have been informed of that fact before the decision was taken, because it certainly might have made a difference to the decision if the machinery of the House has broken down under the strain put upon it?—[Interruption.]—On a point of order, might I ask the Minister whether we could be informed what time it was known that this was broken down? Is it not rather a serious matter that Members should not have the bells ringing in the regular way?
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 27—(Effect Of Capitalisation Of Profits On Rate Of Profits Tax);16;I should be very churlish if I did not make my acknowledgment to you, Major Milner.
1943-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-31;Road Traffic Regulation;118;While it is possible that a Regulation in similar terms might have been made under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, that provision was designed for the regulation of traffic in peace-time in the interests of public safety and the prevention of damage to road surfaces, and it would have been inappropriate to use it to meet a war-time need for which it was never intended. The sole purpose of the Order to which my hon. friend refers is to conserve rubber as a measure of war economy and as such it is appropriate that it should be made under the Defence Regulations. The suggestion in the second part of the Question does not therefore arise.
1943-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-06;Ministers' Salaries (Income Tax);55;This matter was discussed by the House during the Debates on the Ministers of the Crown Bill, 1937. Undoubtedly, the  position as stated by my hon. Friend discloses a case requiring consideration, in respect of junior Ministers. The Government have not, up to the present, felt themselves able to make any recommendation to the House.
1943-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-7-06;Ministers' Salaries (Income Tax);6;I hope that is personal experience.
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Dock Strikes;80;:I have to put a Question to the Minister of Labour, of which I have given Private Notice. May I say that at the request of the Minister of Labour I have put this Question off from day to day for some time, but I gather that now it is not inopportune for* me to put the Question to the right hon. Gentleman. Has the Minister of Labour any statement to make with regard to the position at the docks?
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Dock Strikes;26;Are we right in assuming that all necessary military labour will be used to avert a food catastrophe through the non-arrival of essential and perishable supplies?

1954-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-10-21;Nuclear Weapons (Soviet Experiments);34;As I have said before, it would not be in the public interest to disclose the extent of our information relating to Russian nuclear weapon experiments. The subject continues to occupy our unceasing attention.

1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);18;We are always giving prolonged consideration to the matter, but so far I have not taken any steps.
1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);14;I would confine myself to saying that all relevant matters are constantly being considered.
1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);10;I think it is pretty well on the same lines.
1954-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-12-07;German Armaments And Troops (Second World War);132;It has not been found possible to find the text of any message sent by me to Field Marshal Montgomery in May, 1945, concerning captured German arms. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find it. I will, of course, publish in the OFFICIAL REPORT any result should it be achieved. I certainly proposed around this time that the destruction of captured German arms should be delayed and my telegrams have been published. With regard to Question No. 51, in the name of the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Warbey), Field Marshal Montgomery has also reported to me that no arrangements of this kind were ever discussed between him and Field Marshal von Busch and no German armed forces were maintained in being after their unconditional surrender.
1954-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-12-07;German Armaments And Troops (Second World War);54;As to people being profoundly shocked, of course some people are very hard up to find something to talk about. As to the question about Field Marshal Montgomery, I think the hon. Member is stealing a march on the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) who has already got a Question down for Thursday.
1954-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-12-07;German Armaments And Troops (Second World War);18;If the hon. Gentleman will put that on the Order Paper, I will give it very careful consideration.

1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;54;I am sure that we have all listened with great interest to the statement which the Prime Minister has made. May I ask him if this statement has been collated with or is to be read in accordance with the other statement issued this morning by the National Eexcutive Committee of the Labour Party?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;113;The Labour Party document to which the right hon. Gentleman refers is a general statement of party policy, and it sets out, in the section on the problem of the basic industries, what the party considers to be the ultimate necessities of a fully developed scheme of European co-operation in this field. But the Government have always made clear both at the O.E.E.C. and elsewhere that they are fully prepared to co-operate in the closer integration of the European economy with other countries which hold different economic views. The Labour Party document is not, of course, a statement of Government policy in this matter. Government policy is as I have just now stated.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;103;It is evident, I am sure, that we should have a discussion on this matter at an early date. It is very complicated, and we have two versions presented to us of the policy of the party opposite. There are also many difficult aspects of this question. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if we can have a Debate on this matter next week? I do not think it should be left too long in view of the uncertainties there are. May I also ask whether the Prime Minister will publish a White Paper—I think he intends to do so—containing the text—
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;30;I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman quite caught what I said. I said that a White Paper was being published. It was available at 3.30 this afternoon.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;80;I am very much obliged. I presume that the Prime Minister will give us an opportunity of discussing this matter next week. I am sure that everyone will welcome the opportunity. Meanwhile, may I assure the right hon. Gentleman of the sympathy we all feel with him in his position as the only Socialist Prime Minister, outside the Iron Curtain and Scandinavia, in the whole of Europe, the whole British Commonwealth of Nations or the whole of the English-speaking world.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;61;Regarding the last point of the right hon. Gentleman, I would remind him that during the war he was the only Conservative Prime Minister among the Allies and in the British Commonwealth and he was indebted to strong support from the Labour Governments in the Commonwealth. With regard to his first question, perhaps the Lord President of the Council will reply.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;17;I would assure the right hon. Gentleman that I was only expressing my sympathy with his loneliness.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;21;I shall fortify myself by the example of the way the right hon. Gentleman stood up to it during the war.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;76;The question of having any Debate, and so on, is suitable to the usual channels, but Parliament has its rights in regard to whether large questions should be debated on particular occasions; and is not this exactly a topic on which the House of Commons should express an opinion? May not we have an assurance—apart from any discussions through the usual channels—that we will be given an opportunity next week when we can discuss this matter?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;8;The right hon. Gentleman is not the judge.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;121;Does not the proposal suggested by the right hon. Gentleman give him or the Government absolutely indefinite power of delaying a Debate on this matter? They have only to say, "We do not know all the facts and so we will put off the Debate." But the House is the judge and not the Government of whether a Debate should take place upon a grave public matter, and I ask expressly and explicitly that this matter should be discussed next week. As to the right hon. Gentleman saying, "Take one of your Supply Days," that really is not worthy of a Government which, although it has only a majority of four or five, still presumes to rule over these vast spheres.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;42;That brings out the difficulty of discussing this plan. There are no details whatever. This is a sketch of a great idea, but it has not  yet been filled out in any detail, and I cannot give an answer to that question.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;12;Full arrangements have already been made for complete liaison in this matter.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;18;I could not quite understand the question of my right hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger).
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;54;In a matter of this kind it really is not for us to ask the French Government to put themselves out for the convenience of this House. This House should debate the matter at the right time when they get the information, and in due course we shall get notice from the French Government.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;20;I do not think there was time for any consultation. This is a specific invitation addressed to His Majesty's Government.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;46;Is it not, instead of a discussion of these detailed proposals, rather an account which we require of the negotiations which have taken place  and of the Government's action and policy and the general principles by which they will be guided in any discussion of detail?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;63;If the hon. Member will read the statement I have made in this House, he will see that the attitude of His Majesty's Government is perfectly clear. We accept this as a great idea, but it is quite impossible for us at present to accept it in all its details—or indeed the exact principle—before we know how it will work out in fact.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;150;I entirely agree. The only point we have made is that if it is to be a fruitful discussion, it should be a discussion on definite proposals. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman can see the implications of this scheme or indeed the general framework of the scheme at present. I cannot. I think we should do better when we know more about it. That is the only point. There is no intention whatever of avoiding a Debate. This is a matter of very great importance to this country, to Europe and to the world. If the right hon. Gentleman will consider the matter carefully, I think he will see that a mere Debate in the void on some general question of what we can do on this matter would not take us very far without seeing more in detail what the French Government have in mind.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;83;Surely it may be a long time before the French Government, having had only preliminary pourparlers with other countries, are in a position to state their detailed proposals? Are not the detailed proposals of the French Government to be put forward as a basis of discussion among a large number of Powers to be assembled round a table? How long is all that going to take? Are we really to be denied a Debate in Government time upon an issue of this importance?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;12;I understand that the meeting is to take place on the 20th.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;126;If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will read the White Paper, he will see exactly what took place. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman thinks that we should have accepted this position and bound ourselves to agree to something about which we had no details, that is a matter which he might debate; but as I understand the position, the general view expressed in this country is that we should like to see more details before we bind ourselves. It was not the case that we refused to go to a round-table conference. We were perfectly willing. We were not prepared to go to a round-table conference binding ourselves to do certain things which we might have found we were not able to do.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;86;Would not it be very easy and appropriate for the right hon. Gentleman to expound at greater length in a Debate what he has just been saying in answer to the last question? The Government have to declare and explain their conduct in relation to these matters as far as they are known to us. To say  that we shall have to wait until the cut-and-dried detailed proposals agreed upon by all the different countries can be placed before us is, I think, very abusive treatment.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;122;All I say to the right hon. Gentleman is that he is again mistaken about what I said. I never suggested that we should wait until agreed and cut-and-dried proposals have been reached by all the Governments. What I did suggest was that we might see what was the actual scheme put forward. I suggest that if the right hon. Gentleman would read the White Paper first of all, he would see the course of the discussions. My statement today will not add much to what is in the White Paper, which sets out, I think very clearly and in a way which can be understood on both sides, exactly the reasons why we could not go in with our hands bound.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;57;I was not prejudging the issue, because it requires very careful consideration in many of its different aspects, but I do ask that we should now have a Debate next week promised to us. It would be a proper thing in a matter of this extreme importance for the Government to have the Debate in their time.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;16;We do not want to embarrass the discussions by putting forward proposals ourselves at this time.

The general practice in these matters has been stated over and over again. On matters of this kind Commonwealth Governments are kept fully informed.

1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Complaint Of Privilege;38;I am very glad indeed to receive your Ruling. It is a matter for the House to decide, no doubt after  debate and if necessary after a Division, whether this matter should be proceeded with immediately or not.
1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Complaint Of Privilege;46;I am only endeavouring to ascertain what the Rule is on the matter. If the hon.

1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Complaint Of Privilege;21;I wish to follow the line you have indicated, Mr. Speaker. I beg to move, "That the debate be now adjourned."
1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Complaint Of Privilege;104;Another point which seems to me to make it important that the debate should be adjourned and that the House should consider precedents before they submit the complaint to the Committee of Privileges is that a member of another place is involved. The Right Reverend Bishop of Rochester is a peer. Surely it would be only reasonable and decorous for us to be sure that we had not in any way infringed the privileges of another place before we decide offhand to remit the matter to the Committee of Privileges in which the conduct of a member of another place will be directly involved.
1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Complaint Of Privilege;38;I can only speak again with the indulgence of the House.

1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;266;I believe it will be the general wish of the House that I should initiate a Debate on Foreign Affairs this afternoon by making a statement as to the attitude of His Majesty's Government as affected by recent events in Europe. I deliberately choose the word "attitude" rather than "policy," because I cannot imagine that any events would change the fundamental basis of British foreign policy which is the maintenance and preservation of peace and the establishment of a sense of confidence that peace will, in fact, be maintained. That must, I think, always be the aim of any Government of this country, because, as has so often been said, peace is the greatest interest of the British Empire. But that does not mean that nothing would make us fight. We are bound by certain Treaty obligations which would entail upon us the necessity of fighting if the occasion arose, and I hope no one doubts that we should be prepared, in such an event, to fulfil those obligations. Then there are certain vital interests of this country for which, if they were menaced, we should fight—for the defence of British territories and the communications which are vital to our national existence. There are other cases, too, in which we might fight, if we were clear that either we must fight or else abandon, once and for all, the hope of averting the destruction of those things which we hold most dear—our liberty and the right to live our lives according to the standards which our national traditions and our national character have prescribed for us.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;182;I am sure they recognise the source from which I have drawn those words. They might, indeed, have come from a speech of my own, but, as a matter of fact, they are drawn from a leading article, and, I think in the circumstances, I should say a courageous article, in the "Daily Herald." I hope hon. Members opposite will be prepared to accept from their own organ what, perhaps, I could hardly expect them to accept from me, and that they will be willing to face to-day these hard facts. Since I am looking now, not for differences, but for agreement, may I not hope that hon. Members opposite will also agree with me that the best thing we could do for the League would be to nurse it back to health, not only because its original aims were right, but because, if only we could make It wide enough and strong enough to fulfil the functions for which it was originally designed, it might yet become the surest and most effective guarantee for peace that the world has yet devised?
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;230;Everybody in this House will agree that our aim is the preservation of peace, but an aim is not the same as a policy. You may aim at peace, but you may differ as to the policy which is to secure peace. I thought that right from the start the Prime Minister was confused in his mind between aims and policies, and having followed his speech out very closely I could not discern anything in it in the nature of a policy which made for peace. I could not find any approach to any policy to establish peace on firm foundations. I found the acceptance of certain principles, and then I found them immediately discarded. I found the Prime Minister stating very strongly the principle that the rule of force should give way to the rule of law, that he did not believe in the arbitrament of force, but in actual fact he yields to force all the time. He is proceeding on a policy of negotiation with persons who have shown their belief in force and who exercise force even while he is negotiating with them. I am really surprised that a Prime Minister who experienced what our Prime Minister experienced recently in his negotiations with Germany and the occurrence in Austria, despite all the professions which we had of good faith, should express himself with that amazing credulity.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;93;Perhaps the hon. and gallant Member will read my speech in the morning. I was not dealing at that moment with the point which he made. Perhaps he did not quite follow me. I was dealing with the importance of basing peace in the world on the preservation of moral principle, and I said that that brought an immense force behind those who believed in the League of Nations. I was emphasising the difference between an alliance of the old time and a definite alliance in support of the principles of the League.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;178;During all these years the situation has been steadily slipping down into world anarchy again, and no real effort has been made to deal with the causes that make war. We hold that changes may be necessary. They may be changes in the political organisation of Europe, but they should not be brought about by the brute force of one Power acting on its own. They should be brought about by consultation between Powers who have come together on the basis of consultation, and not on the basis of the mere exercise of force. We believe in the maintenance of force, not to keep things in an uneasy equilibrium, but to deal with the causes of war; above all, with the economic causes of war. When we discussed this matter in December last, the Prime Minister said that it was better  to try to settle the political difficulties before we dealt with the economic difficulties. He has not been very successful with the political difficulties. Perhaps he had better turn and try to deal with the economic difficulties.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;31;The right hon. Baronet's memory has misled him. The observations to which he is referring were not directed to the conference at all; they were directed to the system of alliances.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;4;What does that prove?
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;152;The Prime Minister, in what I think it is not presumptuous for me to describe as a very fine speech, set before us the object which is in all our minds, namely, how to prevent war. A country like ours, possessed of immense territory and wealth, whose defences have been neglected, cannot avoid war by dilating upon its horrors, or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities, or by ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere. War will be avoided, in present circumstances, only by the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor. If our defences are weak, we must seek allies and, of course, if we seek allies, as my right hon. Friend and "landlord" the Member for South Molton (Mr. Lambert) has pointed out, alliances involve commitments. But the increase of commitments may be justified if it is followed by a still greater increase of deterrents against aggression.

1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);85;In the Debate on the Address, we had every reason to suppose that the Government would resist the proposals of Mr. Costello's Government to sever the last tenuous link with the Crown, and that the Southern Irish would be confronted with all the difficulties which would arise in respect of the nationality of Irishmen in Great Britain and of the British in Ireland, and also in all matters connected with preference and trade relations. Now it appears from the statement which has just been made——
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);43;Further to that point of Order. I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that when a statement of this momentous character is made by the Government, some statement of the position of the Opposition, naturally confined within moderate limits, is permissible and is customary.
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);117;I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention, and, addressing myself with great particularity to the Question whether we should now adjourn, may I be permitted to say that, whereas in the Debate on the Address we had every reason to believe that His Majesty's Government intended to raise all these issues of nationality and  preference if the Dublin Government decided to sever this last tenuous link, they have now abandoned that position. They are going to acquiesce in arrangements which leave the Southern Irish in full enjoyment of any advantages there may be in being connected with the British Empire and Commonwealth without having any reciprocal obligations of their own towards it.
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);45;In reply to the right hon. Gentleman, there is no change whatever in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. It was, I thought, quite unnecessary for me to repeat the statement I made in this House as recently as 28th October, in which I said:

1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);2;Why not?
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);7;I felt bound to make a statement.
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);244;Further to that point of Order. I am bound to say that these questions have been put to you, as you know, Sir, on a very serious statement which has been made by the Government Front Bench. It was a statement of policy on which, evidently, something was required to be said to indicate the position of the Opposition. Undoubtedly, it raises difficult questions as to exactly what should be said, or at what length such a statement may be made. I fear that, in what I was saying, I may perhaps have used language a little more definite than should have characterised an ordinary statement in response to a Government declaration, but I do think that this is a matter of great, and even of historic, importance. My hon. and right hon. Friends behind me who are associated with me feel that their position must be safeguarded at this stage in the interests of the House, and it was in that sense that I ventured to trespass, but I am grateful to the Chief Whip for having moved the Motion for the Adjournment, which, of course, placed me in Order. I trust that my hon. and right hon. Friends on this side will make sure that the progress of Government Business is not hampered or prolonged as the result of the Chief Whip having moved the Adjournment as an act of courtesy, and also, I think, for the general convenience of the House.

I did explain then that I did not think it was the practice of this House to try to evaluate how the votes cast in an election are affected by what had been done in a previous Parliament.
1950-9-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-9-14;Iron And Steel Corporation (Membership);30;I would point out that since then there have been some remarkable advances, retirements and side-stepping on the subject of the control of the steel industry by the Conservative Party.
1950-9-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-14;Iron And Steel Corporation (Membership);34;I must say that I must express my very great regret to the Prime Minister that, with all the responsibilities that rest upon him he should have done this reckless, wanton and partisan act.
1950-6-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-28;House Of Commons (Microphones);166;May I be permitted to add that, personally, I was a little concerned in raising the matter. On Monday, I thought that the microphone was much more powerful than it had been before, and my opinion was shared by a number of hon. Members with whom I talked. It causes a reverberation which makes it very difficult for the speaker to modulate his voice in accordance with the accidents of Debate. Therefore, I asked my right hon. Friend the Chief Opposition Whip whether there had been any change, and he told me that the microphone had been geared up over the weekend and made more strong. All I asked was whether there could be a return to the normal practice of last week, and the previous week before I spoke. But, by some error, it was turned off altogether. I hope I made myself heard to the House, and I make my apologies to the "gods" in the Gallery for any inconvenience they may have suffered.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;8;:Why does the hon. Gentleman call that misleading?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;284;This Debate was originally fixed to take place last week. I should like to begin by expressing my regret to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite that, owing to my personal physical weakness, I was not able to be present on that occasion, and also my appreciation of their courtesy in consenting to postpone the Debate until I was able to take my place here again. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) began his speech by complaining that we have treated the Motion as a Vote of Censure, but I think  he will see that it was inevitable that we should do so owing to the terms in which it is couched. Although it does not actually declare that this House has no confidence in the Government, there are in the terms of the Motion two implications which come as near as no matter to the same thing. The first implication is that the condition of the country's air defences and the administration of those defences by the Air Ministry are so bad that a searching inquiry is necessary; and the second implication is that the Government cannot be trusted to make that inquiry itself, but that the inquiry must be handed over to some outside, independent, or, as the hon. Gentleman said, impartial body. What is that but want of confidence? If the hon. Gentleman had confidence in the Government, he would not require to take the matter out of their hands and give it to somebody else. I think it is a little unreasonable of hon. Gentlemen opposite to put down a Motion in those terms and then complain that we treat it as a Vote of Censure.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;151;I heard a speech lasting more than an hour from the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland, and I think it is a little early to begin interruptions of my speech, especially as I am not now saying anything which is controversial or provocative. I put it to hon. Members that no Government can dispense with its own responsibility for the efficiency of the Defence Services of the Crown. I put it to them that what is wanted at this moment is not any digging up of the past or attempts to place the fault, if fault there be, here or there. What we want is a continuous review by the man who is principally responsible—that is, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air —of all the circumstances of the case and the devotion of his whole mind to the removal of faults and the prosecution of the programme.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;10;What does the hon. Member mean to imply by that?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;9;Is the hon. Member trying to depreciate its performance?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;291;I will not argue that, and I am not saying that that is the normal speed. I did not say so. I was going on to say that the pilot was able  to find his way and steer a correct course by his instruments alone and that that showed that, while we have developed these great speeds, we have not neglected the question of safety or of adaptability. It is interesting to compare the speeds that are being achieved to-day with those which were achieved only a comparatively short time ago, and, of course, when the hon. Gentleman compares the output of aeroplanes to-day with the output of aeroplanes during the War he is comparing two things which are as different from one another as chalk from cheese. The Bulldog squadron which was formed long after the War in 1929 had a top speed of 163 miles an hour; the first squadron of Gauntlets which was formed in 1935 had a top speed of 230 miles an hour; but now we are well over speeds of 300 miles an hour, and the Spitfire, to which I think the hon. Member alluded, is, I am informed, the fastest fighter in service squadrons anywhere in the world. [Interruption.] It is shortly coming into service. In speaking of bombers, I cannot, of course, disclose the range of the bomb loads of the latest types, but those which are now in service are, I understand, the fastest bombers in the world, and the new types which are now on order show such a marked advance in all respects upon those which are now in service that I think it is very unlikely that their performance will be surpassed by the bombers of any other country.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;10;Will my right hon. Friend say how often it meets?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;216;Continuously; it is in continuous session. Let me explain to the House how this committee works. In the case of every one of these commodities —-and I have given only some—it assesses what would be the probable demand for that commodity in wartime, based, of course, on certain hypotheses as to the conditions of the war. It has inspected hundreds of factories all through the country. It has now allocated the capacity for each of these commodities, and where the capacity does not fully exist it has taken, or is taking, steps to supply the deficiency. It handles all questions of priority as between one Department and another, and that covers not only materials but labour. It has the closest relation with industry because it has on it representatives of industry, leading men who are in close touch with it and who act, in fact, as chairmen of some of its subcommittees. This is an organisation which was founded as long ago as 1924. It has been gradually building up this system. There was nothing like it before 1914, before the Great War, and I am bound to say that I find great difficulty in seeing how it will be possible to improve upon it to-day for the particular purposes for which it has been constituted.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;122;It has to be a great deal more than that if it is to be an improvement on the present system. I submit to hon. Members that you can do a great deal to-day by persuasion, by voluntary effort, and by co-operation with labour and with employers; but if you want to produce the sort of effect you had in the Great War, when the Government had absolute control over the whole of industry throughout the country, you must give this ministry the same sort of powers. I would remind hon. Members that among those powers were not only the power of controlling factories, but the power of relaxing trade union practices and regulations, the power over strikes, the power over dilution—
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;108;That is what I am pointing out. I think we can do what we want without. What I am saying is that I do not think it is any use setting up a ministry of supply with the same limited powers that we have already. If  you want to go further than that you must have these further powers over industry and over labour, and I doubt very much whether we should be justified in asking for such powers, or whether, if we did ask for them, Parliament would give us them in time of peace. The analogy of wartime is really misleading. We are not at war.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;28;What I said was that my right hon. Friend's record guaranteed that he would give all his energy and ability, and lose no opportunity of remedying any deficiencies.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;204;We are debating a Motion for an inquiry into the state and condition of air defence, and I must say that the various postponements, and the changes which have taken place, have introduced new features into the argument. The inquiry was demanded for two purposes—first, to fix responsibility for the failures of the past; and secondly, to stimulate more vigorous action in the future. The second of these purposes must be assumed, to some extent at any rate, to be fulfilled by the appointment of a new Minister. Everyone wishes my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air success. He brings, as the Prime Minister said, high administrative experience, abilities that we all know, and House of Commons experience—he brings it all to his difficult task. We are all sure that he will try his best, and that he will not spare himself in any way. The very fact of appointing a new Minister means that the whole structure and work of the Department will be  surveyed and scrutinised from a new point of view, and the public and Parliamentary criticism, which is rife at this moment, must necessarily be extremely effective at the time when this new survey is being made.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;4;What date was that?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;5;The date is 7th March.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;3;Before the Anschluss.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;89;With great respect, the Prime Minister must not use arguments that are not relevant to the issue. The Government have promised air parity with Germany. What relation has that got to the Anschluss? The question of our air strength is not influenced from day to day and hour to hour by the accidents and changes that take place in Europe. Let me read to the House—for I think we have some grievance in this matter—a statement made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Coordination of Defence: 
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;131;I think that makes it worse. It is one of those statements which, apart from the purport, you can just claim to be literally true, but when it is presented to Parliament it has just the effect complained of in the statement of the Secretary of State for War yesterday, of having a thoroughly soothing, reassuring effect on the general public, while, at the same time, it in no way represents the actuality of the position. Everybody listening to that would have thought that the trouble was over, and that the great flow of new machines was coming forward 22 months ago. Yet it is not until 31st March, 1939, that we are to have even 1,750 first-line aeroplanes. I have dealt with the interruption made by my right hon. Friend.

Friend think that it is a rather fine thing on the part of Members of this Committee and members of former Governments that they should adhere to great acts of policy in which they have been concerned even after they ceased to be responsible, even if there is no popularity to be got out of them? I have paid compliments to those who have gained a great deal of help and support from Dr. Adenauer and have not cast acts of faith away as if they were worth nothing.
1944-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-11-17;Overseas Forces (Home Leave Scheme);35;I have two statements, which, with permission, I should like to make to the House. The first concerns a scheme which we have been working out for a system of short leave for troops overseas.
1944-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-11-17;Overseas Forces (Home Leave Scheme);98;Of course, it includes Burma; the South East Asia Command, indeed, is principally concerned at this time with Burma. As far as local leave in theatres of war is concerned, that is a matter for the Commanders-in-Chief, and much is done to give a break and change to the officers and men who are in this heavy fighting. But I am looking forward to a period, which I cannot forecast now, when it will be possible to introduce something like a short leave to England scheme from France and Germany such as we had in the last war.

1954-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-7-07;Anglo-American Talks;50;I think that illustrates how undesirable it is to state a list of names and for two countries meeting together, as we did, in discussion to do more than express a general opinion and not deliberately pick and choose who are in and who are out of a particular list.

Is there any reason why the House of Commons should not have an opportunity in Government time and on Government responsibility of debating so heavy an additional charge on the life and activity of the nation?

Here is the right hon. Gentleman. imposing a tax of £27 million in a year. [HON. MEMBERS: " It is not a tax." It is in all except the name a tax on the public, and the right hon.

The House will, I am sure, realise that each Dominion is differently circumstanced in this matter, and that it may not be easy to arrange for all the Dominion Prime Ministers to visit this country at the same time.

1941-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-11;Dominion Prime Ministers (Co-Operation);126;That is a very large question, and I am not prepared to deal with it now. I think it would be very desirable to have an Imperial Conference to see what could be arranged, but it is not easy to have an Imperial Conference. We must remember that these Dominion Prime Ministers are persons of the highest consequence in their own countries, that they have the highest affairs to settle and legislatures to wait upon constantly. It is not easy for them to find the opportunity, much as they would wish to do so; but if we can get them here in the course of the summer or the autumn these matters can be discussed. Meanwhile, they are not much helped by questions of this sort.

The Noble Lord has not attempted to go into merits. In fact I gather that his position is that he takes no responsibility for the charges. They may be true, they may be false, they may be exaggerated; but however it may be, he raises only the issue of principle, of Parliamentary usage and custom. As that is an important issue, I feel it my duty to deal with it myself, because although I am not the Father of the House I have been here a good deal longer than the Father.

If we are challenged, if we advise against a Select Committee and we are challenged, the reason is because our solemn statement, given in all honesty and good faith, is challenged and doubted by the House. I am not blaming the Noble Lord; I should not hesitate to express my view contrary to the Government if I were free to do so, but to pretend that there have been deployed any sufficient grounds or any sufficient evidence or to pretend that there is at the present time any great body of Parliamentary opinion in favour of a Select Committee is, in my view, quite incorrect.

1947-1-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-22;Special Dietetic Allowances (Medical Advice);106;The right hon. Gentleman the Minister has read out a long and impressive list of all these great authorities whose high standing is supposed to flatten out all criticism of their work, but has he not taken the opportunity, when examining all their credentials and qualifications, to find out how often they meet and how long it takes them to get a borderline case dealt with? Is he now sure, as we all recognise the intelligence which he is giving to his task, that this impressive apparatus at the top is effectively dealing with the many urgent matters which arise in practical instances in ordinary life?
1947-1-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-22;Special Dietetic Allowances (Medical Advice);27;I presume, nevertheless, that the right hon. Gentleman will give us the exact dates of the meetings of the Committee in the last year or 18 months.

1947-1-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-22;Special Dietetic Allowances (Medical Advice);47;The right hon. Gentleman has not really dealt with the point.

1937-6-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-6-17;India (Questions To Ministers);193;I must apologise to the House if my answer exceeds the length ordinarily regarded as appropriate for an oral answer, but my right hon. Friend's question does not lend itself very readily to a brief reply. Let me make two points clear at the outset. The first is that I do not regard the Government of India Act, 1935, as having produced, until Part II of the Act relating to Federation is brought into force, any such change in the relationship between the Central Government of India and Parliament as to justify or necessitate any change in practice and policy in regard to question and answer in this House relating to the operations of that Government. The Governor-General of India in Council still remains, so long as Part XIII of the Act is in operation, responsible through the Secretary of State for India to Parliament here. There is, of course, a well-known and well-established  convention in relation to the fiscal policy of the Indian Government, but, apart from that, the Central Government remains legally subject in respect of all its operations to the direction and control of His Majesty's Government in this country.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);169;My right hon. and gallant Friend the present Minister of State will be appointed Minister of Production. The Minister of Production is the Minister charged with chief responsibility—I may here interpolate the fact that, in the White Paper, publication of which was withdrawn, the expression "prime responsibility" is used. "Prime" in the dictionary is capable of meaning either "chief" or "primary." It is in the sense of "chief" rather than "primary" that the word is used. The word "primary" might conflict with the departmental responsibility of the Prime Minister.—He is charged, as I say, with chief responsibility on behalf of the War Cabinet, for the business of war production as a whole, subject, of course, to the policy of the Minister of Defence and of the War Cabinet itself. Subject to the position of the Admiralty, which I will mention later, he will have full effective powers to concert and supervise the activities of the Production Departments, including the adjustment of existing programmes and the initiation of future policy.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);17;I think that is clear in my statement, and it can be further elucidated in the Debate.

1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);29;Yes, Sir. I hope that the indisposition of the Minister of Production will be only temporary and brief and that he will be fit to take the Debate shortly.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);29;Yes, Sir. The Minister will have a thoroughly effective secretariat, and he will, of course, have assistance from all the technical staffs in the Departments under his general supervision.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);51;I do not think it is necessary to go into these domestic details. As a matter of fact, we prefer to stand on a general statement of policy, and we should not run the risk of publishing a White Paper and of appearing to settle everything in too legalistic a manner.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);42;No, Sir, on the contrary, and if the hon.

We are, among other things, fighting it in order to survive, and when our capacity to do that is more generally recognised throughout the world, when the conviction that we have about it here becomes more general, then we shall be in a good position to take a further view of what we shall do with the victory when it is won.
1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;43;I think there is great danger in making statements which are not of a very general character upon this subject.

1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;23;Certainly I bear it in mind, and, having borne it in mind, I have ventured to give the answer which I have given.

We could not therefore propose that other countries should submit to such restrictions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation can therefore only impose restrictions on the actions of member Governments when they are acting as members of that Organisation. I may add that it is public knowledge that American Air forces based in Britain will only be used with the consent of Her Majesty's Government.

This was a set of decisions, with which I do not in principle disagree, left us by our predecessors. I may say that I have heard it reported that the re-armament programme of £4,700 million agreed to by the late Government would now probably cost something in the neighbour-hood of £5,200 million owing to the ever-increasing lack of purchasing power of the £ sterling, and that is a factor to be taken into consideration. We shall do our best to meet all these difficulties.

In order to put as many minds at rest as possible, let me begin by saying two things. First, we do not propose at the present time to extend compulsion to join the Services to any married women, not even childless married women. They may of course volunteer, but they will not be compelled. Secondly, as regards married women and industry, we have already the power, and my right hon. Friend has already been given the power and has been frequently reminded of it, to direct married women into industry. This power will continue to be used with discretion. The wife of a man serving in  the Forces or Merchant Navy will not be called upon to work away from her home area; nor will women with household responsibilities be moved from their home area. But there are some married women without children or other household responsibilities whom we may have to call upon to go to another area where their industrial services are needed.

If there are these cries from both sides, would it not be better to allow the decision of the Commission, arrived at on grounds and by procedure approved by the Government, to come into effect; and is it not vitiating the whole principle of a redistribution system if, because a number of Socialist pocket boroughs in London, including the Prime Minister's, happen to be disfranchised, the whole business of going through this procedure should be begun again?

May I ask why, at a time when the Government, unknown to us, have consulted Mr. Speaker upon these matters, no communication was made to this side of the House about a matter, on which, hitherto, we had all been united? Why was not that done?

1939-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-3-16;Navy Estimates, 1939;5;No. I agree with you.
1939-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-3-16;Navy Estimates, 1939;187;It was a great opportunity for the Fnancial Secretary, both last year and this year, to have to make the general statement on behalf of the Admiralty and to present the Estimates to the House. I believe that every one feels that he has seized this opportunity with a long arm and a firm hand, and has put it to the best possible use. I should like to associate myself with the tribute which he paid to Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson. Those of us who know that officer—and I knew him when he was gunnery lieutenant doing the gunnery trials of the ships when we were building before the Great War—will realise the rare and remarkable qualities which he brought to the service of the Royal Navy. He has expended his energy, his life, his thought, his mental energy, an attribute which is rare nowadays, in the most generous manner, and if he has been stricken down by an affliction, which we all hope is only temporary, he is in exactly the same position as a brave officer who is wounded fighting for his country in action.
1939-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-3-16;Navy Estimates, 1939;288;It is well known that at the most critical period of the War this officer, then in a subordinate station, taking his career in his hands, presented facts and figures and arguments which eventually reached the highest authority—the Prime Minister—and that through that report a great change was made in our naval disposition, without which it could not be said with certainty that the submarine menace at that time would have been overcome. I naturally can touch upon only very few points in the extremely important and weightily considered statement to which we have  listened. The first is a very small point, but as I am dealing with the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty I would say that it has particular relevance to his office. The expense of the Navy is rising this year by £23,000,000, and yet the Estimate is presented in a form which states, in a most decisive manner, a net decrease of £26,000,000. This is due, as footnotes explain, to the fact that £84,000,000 is provided by Loan or Appropriations-in-Aid in 1939 instead of £34,000,000 from that source in 1938. It would hardly be possible to make a financial statement in amore misleading, and I must say, or more silly fashion. After all, the fact that this House is providing £153,000,000 for service of the Navy in this critical year, is a factor which may play an important part in maintaining stability. Why then state it in the worst way? I happen to know that many people, some of whom ought to know better, have been misled by the form in which these figures are presented, and by the statement that there is a net decrease in the expense of the Navy of £26,000,000.
1939-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-3-16;Navy Estimates, 1939;123;I hope that the denunciation which I am now endeavouring to apply to what has been done, or proposed to be done, will, at any rate, have the effect of saving the others. The House would hardly gather from the euphemistic phrase the Parliamentary Secretary employed—"replacement"—that these two ships are to be destroyed. That does not tell us what one would expect, that until the new ships are in commission the old ones will be kept in reserve. In other days I used to say that when the ace is out the king is the best card. These old ships can play their part, although we must be careful not to bring them into contact with new ships in the event of war.

Of course, an Opposition puts down an Amendment with a number of criticisms, and it is undoubtedly open to the Opposition to complain if any one of those criticisms, or of the points raised for discussion, is not fully or properly or timeously dealt with.

It had always been kept open, as I think he will agree, that we should have the right to put in a counter claim for the immense services which we rendered in saving those 400 million people from being ravaged, pillaged and slaughtered as they would otherwise, to a large extent, have been. In what has been concluded now have we kept open until 1951 the full freedom of reviewing this question—the main question of what is called "sterling balances," which is a euphemism for British debts? Is that position open and can it be raised and examined de novo in the year 1951?

This organisation, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, supported by their professional advisers, gives to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the necessary control over not only the military but the civil sphere, subject, of course, to the fact that he has direct access to the Prime Minister or Minister of Defence for the time being, and can thus receive such guidance upon questions of high policy as may from time to time be required. It would be the greatest mistake, at the moment when it may well have to be put to the proof, to liquidate and remould this organisation, which at the present time is working to the satisfaction of all the principal executive persons concerned. It must, of course, be continually tested and improved. I cannot conceive that the proposal pressed in some quarters to appoint a super Commander-in-Chief over the whole field of the three Services and the civil power would not be a serious impediment to effective action; and I have never yet heard any practical suggestion as to who that officer should be.

We have a good deal of business to do before Easter, but I will give an opportunity for the matter to be raised. I hope that if it is raised, it will be debated, not on the Adjournment, but on a Motion moved either by the Government, or by someone opposed to the action of the Government; and I hope that the matter will be pressed to a Division, in order to let us clearly see what is the balance of opinion on the matter.

Great differences arose in their methods of calculation. Hours were wasted in the Committees because they were arguing at cross-purposes, the same words and figures not meaning the same things. So then we established—I was largely guided by Lord Cherwell in this—a uniform system which exists today, by which the basic statistics are presented by each Department upon a common foundation.

1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Government Defeat);166;The event of yesterday requires an alteration in Government Business. It would not be possible for His Majesty's Government to leave matters where they stood when the Motion to report Progress was accepted. At this very serious time in the progress of the war, there must be no doubt or question of the support which the Government enjoy in the House of Commons. Accordingly we have decided, as the first Business on the next Sitting Day, to resume the Committee stage of the Education Bill, and to delete Clause 82, as amended, entirely from the Measure. This act of deletion will be regarded as a Vote of Confidence in the present Administration. If the Government do not secure an adequate majority, it will entail the usual constitutional consequences. Should the House agree to the deletion of the Clause, the Government propose to move to reinstate the original Clause, without the Amendment, on the Report stage, and to treat its passage throughout as a matter of confidence.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Government Defeat);75;No, Sir, I am afraid I cannot, in any way, alter the statement which I have made. It is really impossible to distinguish between votes on domestic policy and votes on the general policy of the war, in this country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] His Majesty's Government are entirely in the hands of the House, which has the fullest authority of any legislative assembly in the world, and we trust it will use it with responsibility.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Government Defeat);86;I was making a statement on the Business of the House, and I think it would be very wrong for the Government to be the first of all Governments to be deprived of the facility of making statements. However, after my statement is finished, the Adjournment of the House will be moved, and if it is thought that a discussion on that Adjournment is likely to lessen the tension which prevails, there will be nothing in the attitude of the Government to prevent it taking place.

With regard to the question asked of me by my right hon. Friend opposite, I entirely share his views that it would be a great pity to have what he called a ragged and stormy Debate to-day. But that is not a matter for us to settle. We have to wipe out the Business to-day and that can only be done by moving the Adjournment of the House.

As to the course which individual Members take on every Amendment, on every question, they must consult their consciences and their duty.

1952-5-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-14;Mediterranean (Nato Command);36;Yes.

I think it would be a great help to many of us in judging these matters to have it clearly established that Parliamentary action had been taken against the conduct of particular Members, irrespective of the well-known Privilege of the House, and irrespective of the judgment of a court of law.

Apparently, at these meetings there was a person present who was not a Member of Parliament at all—the editor of the official paper of the party opposite. Is that not so?
1947-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-30;Cases Of Mr Allig Han And Mr Walkden;124;The right hon. Gentleman says it has nothing to do with this. Let us know what the facts are. If that were so, how can it be argued that this journalist and editor, being present, had not a great advantage which he could use in conducting the whole policy of his newspaper and that he was getting, by the full assent of the Government party, the facilities which other papers were trying to pick up through this course and through that? I think it is most important to know what is the position of a journalist who is invited by the convenors of a party meeting to be present on occasions of this kind. That is what the right hon. Gentleman does not like.
1947-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-30;Cases Of Mr Allig Han And Mr Walkden;15;No; too sweeping and too much associated with a particular procedure of the party meeting.

I am sure that Her Majesty's  Government will always do their best, subject to the demands of public business, to afford opportunities to debate these large issues. I suggest that there are opportunities open to the Opposition on Supply days, and there are other opportunities which readily occur to me but, in any case, we have no desire to prevent these matters from being discussed. On the contrary. Might they not be the subject of discussion through the usual channels to find an opportunity? The House should always be helped to talk about the things it wants to discuss, but there must be reasonable opportunity. Why not let it be discussed in the ordinary manner?

The hon. Gentleman made a very large number of assertions, some of which  were accurate, some of which were, according to my information, rather the reverse. At any rate, hours of debate, day after day, would be required if this House were to attempt to emulate the mastery of the details of the position in Greece, which he has been able to acquire in spite of other serious preoccupations.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);88;I beg pardon. There is always the stock answer that  man embraces woman, unless the contrary appears in the context. But this man, or woman, should do this without fear, and without any form of intimidation or victimisation. He marks his ballot paper in, strict secrecy, and then elected representatives meet and together decide what government, or even, in times of stress, what form of government they wish to have in their country. If that is democracy I salute it. I espouse it. I would work for it.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);85;I am not at all afraid to go into that discussion, but I have a good deal of ground to cover. It is one of those gross misrepresentations in which a certain class of people indulge that I have spoken praising words about Franco. All I said was that Spanish politics did not merely consist in drawing rude cartoons about it. It is really no use for my hon. Friend to screw his face up as if he were taking a nasty dose of medicine.

But so far as the hon. Gentleman is concerned I expect there are some other nasty gulps to swallow in the course of what, with great respect, I shall endeavour to lay before them. I must say that I do not wish to be drawn into a discussion of Spain this morning. In the remarks I make about democracy and the attitude I have taken throughout the time I have been burdened with these high responsibilities, and broadly I believe throughout my life, in the remarks I have made, and in the statements representing the policy of His Majesty's present Government, we stand upon the foundation of free elections based on universal suffrage, and that is what we consider the foundation for democracy.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);149;I am sorry to be causing so much distress. [Interruption.] I have plenty of time, and if any out-cries are wrung from hon. Members opposite I can always take a little longer in what I have to say, though I should regret to do so. I say that the last thing that represents democracy is mob law and the attempt to introduce a totalitarian régime and clamours to shoot everyone—there are lots of opportunities at the present time—who is politically inconvenient as part of a purge of those who are said to have—and very often have not—sought to collaborate with the Germans during the occupation. Do not let us rate democracy so low, do not let us rate democracy as if it were merely grabbing power and shooting those who do not agree with you. That is the antithesis of democracy; this is not what democracy is based on.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);229;The hon. Member should not get so excited because he is going to have much the worse of the argument and much the worse of the Division. I was eleven years a fairly solitary figure in this House and pursued my way in patience, and so there may be hope for the hon. Member. Democracy, I say, is not based on violence or terrorism, but on reason, on fair play, on freedom, on respecting other people's rights as well as their ambitions. Democracy is no harlot to be picked up in the street by a man with a tommy gun. I trust the people, the mass of  the people, in almost any country, but I like to make sure that it is the people and not a gang of bandits from the mountains or from the countryside who think that by violence they can overturn constituted authority, in some cases ancient Parliaments, Governments and States. That is my general description of the foundation upon which we should approach the various special instances on which I am going to dwell. During the war, of course, we have had to arm anyone who could shoot a Hun. Apart from their character, political convictions, past records and so forth, if they were out to shoot a Hun we accepted them as friends and tried to enable them to fulfil their healthy instincts.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);305;We are paying for it in having this Debate to-day, which personally I have found rather enjoyable, so far. We are paying for it also with our treasure and our blood. We are not paying for it with our honour or by defeat But when countries are liberated it does not follow that those who have received our weapons should use them in order to engross to themselves by violence and murder and bloodshed all those powers and traditions and continuity which many countries have slowly developed and to which quite a large proportion of their people, I believe the great majority, are firmly attached. If what is called in this Amendment the action of "the friends of democracy" is to be interpreted as carefully planned coups d' état by murder gangs and by the iron rule of ruffians seeking to climb into the seats of power, without a vote ever having been cast in their favour—if that is to masquerade as democracy I think the House will unite in condemning it as a mockery. I do not admit—I am keeping to the words of the Amendment—that those popular elements who so "valorously"—in some cases I must say—assisted the defeat of the enemy have the right to come forward and say, "We are the saviours of the nation; we must therefore henceforward be its rulers, its masters; that is our reward; we must now claim to sit in judgment over all"—that is, the vast mass of people in every occupied country who have had to live out their lives as well as they could under the iron rule and oppression of  the Germans. These valorous elements are now to rule with dictatorial power gained by a coup d'état, by bloody street fighting and slaughter, and are to judge the high, the middle and the poor.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);185;So far I am generalising on the principles of what democracy should be and also some of the principles which it should not follow. War criminals, the betrayers of their countrymen, the men who sincerely wished that Germany might win—these may be the objects of popular disgust or boycott, and may in extreme cases be brought before the courts of law and punished with death, but I hope those will be courts of law, where fair trial may be had, and not mere expressions of mob juries or political rivals. But to those who try to establish the point that the men who went out into the hills and were given rifles or machine guns by the British Government have by fee simple acquired the right to govern vast complex communities such as Belgium or Holland—it may be Holland next—or Greece, I say I repulse that claim. They have done good service and it is for the State, and not for them, to judge of the regards they should receive. It is not for them to claim ownership of the State, which cannot be admitted.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);163;That is what is being fought out now. However long I laboured I could not hope to convert individual gentlemen opposite to the better course, but I am addressing my remarks not only to them but to other Members in the House, of whom there are quite a large number. I say we march along an onerous and painful path. Poor old England! Perhaps I ought to say "Poor old Britain." We have to assume the burden of most thankless tasks and in undertaking them to be scoffed at, criticised and opposed from every quarter; but at least we know where we are making for, know the end of the road, know what is our objective. It is that these countries shall be freed from the German armed power and under conditions of normal tranquillity shall have  a free universal vote to decide the Government of their country—except a Fascist régime—and whether that Government shall be of the Left or of the Right.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);120;Might I be permitted to continue this argument? [Interruption.] I will give the hon. Gentleman the opportunity when I have finished the particular phase of the argument that I am dealing with. I do not want to deny any courtesy—although it would be abusing that courtesy if the hon. Gentleman turned a question into a speech. After  all, we British, who are now suggested to be poor friends of democracy, lost 35,000 to 40,000 men in opening up the great port of Antwerp, and our Navy has cleared the Scheldt river. The sacrifice of these men has always to be considered, as well as the friends of democracy advancing in lorries—in lorries—from Mons, to start a bloody revolution in Brussels.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);17;I should think it was hardly possible to state the opposite of the truth with more precision.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);234;I back up those who seek to establish democracy and civilisation.—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) must learn to take as well as to give. There is no one more free with interruptions, taunts, and jibes than he is. I saw him—I heard him, not saw him—almost assailing some of the venerable figures on the bench immediately below him. He need not get so angry because the House laughs at him; he ought to be pleased when they only laugh at him. As I said, I back up all those who seek to establish democracy and civilisation on a basis of law, and also popular, untramelled, unintimidated, free, universal suffrage voting. It would be pretty hard on Europe if, after four or five years of German tyranny, she was liquidated and degenerated and plunged into a series of brutal social wars. If the friends of democracy and its various defenders believe that they express the wishes of the majority, why cannot they wait for the General Election; why cannot they await the free vote of the people—which is our sole policy in every country into which British and American Armies are advancing? There is the story of Belgium, which I submit, with the utmost respect and affection, to the American people, as well as to the House of  Commons, carries many lessons which are applicable to other parts of the world.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);138;How little helpful it is to the progress of our Debate to fling in other large questions. I am not speaking about France to-day. I certainly never felt about de Gaulle the sentiments which experience has engendered in me about Count Sforza. De Gaulle is a man of honour, and has never broken his word. That is what I am coming to, because these things have to come out. I say that we should have to put a great deal of responsibility on those who called him to power. We are not avid of becoming deeply involved in the politics of the conquered or liberated countries. All we require from them is a Government which will guarantee us the necessary protection, and facilities for the lines of communication,  from Naples to Ravenna, lately taken, and to the North.

The allegation of the hon. Gentleman is that I made a certain statement here in Secret Session. I submit that I cannot reply to that statement, because of the strict Rules of the House.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);70;I make no comment at all. The hon. Gentleman, no doubt, has quoted many things I have said, as he has a right to do. As I say, our interest in Italy is in the front where we have Armies engaged under General Alexander and General Mark Clark, that daring and skilful American General under whom we have confidently placed an Army which is at least three-quarters British or British-controlled.

I certainly thought, at that particular time, that the kind of regime set up in Italy at that time was better than a general slump of Italy into the furious Bolshevik civil war which was raging in many other parts of Europe. I never see the slightest good in going back on what you have said, and the hon. Member himself has views of his own which seem to be equally obnoxious to all parties in the House.

1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);231;But we had the right to express a point of view on the Greek question, because in an attempt to redeem our pledged word, we have sustained 30,000 casualties, in what may, perhaps, be called a chivalrous resolve to share the miseries of Greece when she was invaded by Italy and Germany in 1941. At this time we were all alone ourselves in the world. My honoured friend, the President, was of opinion that we should certainly have plans made and accordingly, at the Quebec Conference, it was proposed by the combined Chiefs of Staff that the British should prepare a Force to occupy the Athens area and so pave the way for the commencement of relief and for the establishment of law and order and for the instalment of the Greek Government, which we and the great bulk of the United Nations had formally recognised. The Americans and ourselves began to accumulate large masses of food and shipping, and established U.N.R.R.A. U.N.R.R.A. began to grow up in Alexandria and other organisations for food distribution were actively engaged, and we gathered our much strained shipping vessels together at the cost of food to this country. A large part of these stores and medical relief were provided by America out of her riches. The rest of the burden fell upon us, and, of course, the diminution of shipping falls heavily upon us.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);240;The British troops were welcomed enthusiastically as they entered Athens and so also was the Greek Brigade, which had mutinied earlier in the year but was freed from the mutinous element. I took great trouble about this Brigade to give it a chance to redeem its reputation. It not only redeemed its reputation but won renown for the Greek Army by entering Rimini at the head of the Allied Forces. By wresting Rimini from the Germans, this Brigade now came back to Athens, having heaped coals of fire upon the Italian heads who had invited the Germans to ruin Greece. But now the Greeks helped the Italians to drive the Germans from Italy itself, and this Brigade was received with a great welcome in the streets of Athens. By this time M. Papandreou had gathered no less than six E.A.M. representatives into his Government, and the leader of the Liberal Party, Mr. Sophoulis, a veteran and venerable counsellor of 84 or 85 years of age.—[An HON. MEMBER: "You are getting on."]—Oh yes, I am getting on; we are all getting on. Mr. Sophoulis was already complaining that too many E.A.M. and Communist representatives were already installed in places of power. M. Papandreou, however, is a man of the Left, a democrat, a Socialist, not a Liberal or anything like that, in fact almost everything that is supposed to be correct nowadays, M. Papandreou put his trust in those six gentlemen.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);101;I cannot pronounce any of those names rightly. Meanwhile, the forces of E.L.A.S., which is the military instrument of E.A.M., were planning a descent on Athens as a military and political operation and the seizure of power by armed force. E.L.A.S. is a mixed body and it would be unfair to stigmatise them all as being entirely self-seeking in their aims and actions. Nevertheless, during the years of Greek captivity I must say that E.L.A.S. devoted far more attention to beating up and destroying the representatives of the E.D.E.S., commanded by Colonel Zervas, a man of the Left by our standards.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);142;Even extremes meet. He was less extreme than E.A.M. He was a man who was correct according to the current jargon. The wrong element of the E.A.M. devoted themselves more to attacking Zervas and his followers on the West side of Greece than they did to attacking the Germans themselves. For the past two years E.L.A.S. have devoted themselves principally to preparations for seizing power. We may, some of us, have underrated the extremes to which those preparations have been carried or the many privations and cruelties which have been inflicted on the village populations in the areas over which they prevail. [An HON. MEMBER: "What is the evidence?"] I have taken every pains to collect information and everything I say on fact in these matters has been most carefully examined beforehand by the officials who are thoroughly acquainted with the details.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);53;I really must be allowed to continue my argument. [Interruption.] Of course, in this House we are Conservatives, Labour, Liberal and so forth; we are not E.L.A.S. and E.D.E.S. as some gentlemen seem to imagine. They did not hesitate, on occasion, to help the Germans to catch and kill the representatives of E.D.E.S.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);174;In this country we do try to have debate. The hon. Gentleman who, I am sure, has been treated with extraordinary and great consideration in this House in these times, should learn to keep his mouth shut. E.L.A.S. did not hesitate on occasion to help the Germans to catch and kill the supporters of E.D.E.S. The German rule in Greece was feeble and took the form mainly of hideous reprisals upon the unhappy countryside and it was from this that by a kind of tacit agreement the Security Battalions, some of which were a kind of local Home Guard of the villages against predatory E.L.A.S. bands, came into being. Others were formed and acted in a manner contrary to the interests of the country. From the depredations and ravages of E.L.A.S. there was, however, as we can now see, a fairly well organised plot or plan by which E.L.A.S. should march down upon  Athens and seize it by armed force and establish a reign of terror under the plea that they were purging collaborationists.

It is my duty to express the feelings of this House and to pay tribute to the memory of a great Polish patriot and staunch ally, General Sikorski. His death in the air crash at Gibraltar was one of the heaviest strokes we have sustained. From the first dark days of the Polish catastrophe and the brutal triumph of the German war machine until the moment of his death on Sunday night he was the symbol and the embodiment of that spirit which has borne the Polish nation through centuries of sorrow and is unquenchable by agony.

1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;103;We are glad of that. We also respect the Foreign Secretary's British outlook. He represents many of the virtues and some of the weaknesses which have enabled our people to make a tolerably collective presentation of their character to the rest of the world in many years of history. There is also, of course, the sense of war comradeship, which although it must not be allowed to interfere with the proper, due discussion of current affairs or with party strife at a time like this, is nevertheless a subsisting element between many of those who sit on the Front Benches of this House.

At length, in February, 1947, the right hon. Gentleman announced that he had decided to refer the matter to the United Nations. But having done so, what happened? A United Nations Committee was set up to examine the matter. It recommended the termination of the Mandate, and, by a majority vote, it recommended the policy of the partition of Palestine.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;2;What happened?

Gentlemen do not like the argument I have to unfold. They must not shrink from bearing these strokes. We bear with what fortitude we can summon the heavy blows struck us by the Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister  and others, and similar equanimity and toleration should prevail in the ranks of our opponents. His Majesty's Government, in the whole of this matter, have always been one, or even two, and sometimes three, steps behind the march of events. When the State of Israel was proclaimed, it was recognised at once by the Americans. His Majesty's Government could at least have accepted the principle of partition laid down in the United Nations Resolution. When they finally accepted that principle in the Bernadotte Report of September last, why could they not have faced reality and accorded de facto recognition to Israel?
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;28;May I ask the right hon. Gentleman, if he thought that could have been done, why did he not do it after the war? He was in power.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;52;No. The world and the nation had the inestimable blessing of the right hon. Gentleman's guidance. I am sure that we could have agreed immediately after the war upon a partition scheme which would have been more favourable to the Arabs than that which will now follow their unsuccessful recourse to arms.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;81;I give my opinion. I am sure we could have made better arrangements for the Arabs at that time—I am not talking of the Jews—than will be possible after there has been this unfortunate recourse to arms. Indeed, the scheme of partition proposed by U.N.O. was better than what they will get now, after their defeat. We are  evidently in the presence here of prolonged, repeated and serious miscalculations on the part of the Foreign Secretary and his advisers and colleagues.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;146;I find a good deal of difficulty in reconciling the views put out by the different Members on the benches opposite and the views that they have expressed in the past. What the right hon. Gentleman has been telling us now might have been said a good many months ago, and I am going to look back a little bit before I look at the present. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) said, very wisely, perhaps, that the worst thing was to do nothing at all. I must remind the right hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) that this matter was considered in the Government which he led and of which I was a  member, whether action could be taken. He said himself he could have taken action, but he did not take it.

We are now in consultation about it. I am quite sure that we should have been attacked from the other side if we had gone off and done it without having an consultation with the other Commonwealth countries. That would have been the stick used to beat us.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;167;The right hon. Member for Woodford seemed to me to make a number of contradictory statements, and he had very scant regard for the facts. I rather wondered just why he was taking this action. I think that it seemed to him that it might be useful to make an attack on my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary. It has been suggested that the policy followed in Palestine or anywhere else in foreign affairs is the personal, individual policy of the Foreign Secretary. That is entirely untrue. Foreign policy is naturally discussed by the Government, the Government take decisions and the Government stand by the Minister who has to carry out those decisions. The second thing was that a suggestion has been made—I am not sure that the right hon. Member for Woodford did not make it—that my right hon. Friend was actuated by a dislike of the Jews. That is entirely and utterly untrue. My right hon. Friend has many good friends among the Jews—
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;92;—and I imagine that the same applies to hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite. My right hon. Friend has been thanked very often for his services to the cause of the Jews. He has been thanked for his work by Jewish labour for helping them in forming their federation and getting them into the  International Labour Office. Indeed, I have seen a paper circulated in which my right hon. Friend is put down with many other eminent people as one of the architects of Zionism. Yet there is this vendetta against him.

Friend on 29th June, the normal pensions payable to recipients of the Victoria Cross may be increased in cases of need to £75. This  figure was fixed in 1921. Further inquiries have been made, but they do not show any evidence of general complaint as to the adequacy of this special provision. I do not think any change in this well-established practice is called for.

1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Member For Belfast, West (Select Committee's Report);132;But may I draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to the fact that three months have passed since the General Election and that a  constituency with 80,000 voters has been disfranchised during the whole of that period? How do the Government propose to abridge this period of delay? Are they not now presented with a unanimous Report by the Select Committee advising legislation to remove the evil? Are they not also in possession of the legal opinion of the Attorney-General, supported by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Derby (Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe) and other high legal authorities, that there is no case which would sustain a common informer? Are we to continue to keep 80,000 electors without any right to take part in this Parliament?
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Member For Belfast, West (Select Committee's Report);176;I certainly feel that no one would go out of his way to offer any tribute to the Government on account of any undue haste that they have shown in this matter. I had hoped to receive from the right hon. Gentleman today an assurance that the Government would legislate as rapidly as possible in the sense of the unanimous Report of the Committee. As that has not been forthcoming I wish to give notice that in my opinion, supported by a great mass of legal authority, it is the duty of the hon. Member to take the oath and take his seat at the earliest possible opportunity. That is the advice which I propose to tender to him. Does the right hon. Gentleman realise how much the procedure of Select Committees, which we imagined could deal with the matter promptly, has been, as it were,  clouded by the long delay and by all these devices of having it referred to the Privy Council and so on which, happily, the good sense of the Committee repudiated?

1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;61;May I be allowed to say that we all join with the Prime Minister in the expression of sympathy which he has made towards the relatives of those who were killed and. wounded, and also in the terms in which he has referred to the creditable behaviour of our officers and men in the difficult circumstances into which they were put?
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;187;We shall, of course, give the fullest possible details. With regard to the first point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, we have to consider the position, as I stated, of the British communities and representatives in this disturbed area. Over a long period there has been civil war. It was decided that it was wise to keep a vessel at Nanking. It is therefore a matter for decision by those on the spot as to when relief should take place. If it is put off all the time, because of a possible danger—and it is very difficult when there are irregular forces on one side—we should never get that relief, and so I think a decision had to be come to. The right hon. Gentleman would notice that there was talk of an armistice, and the armistice expired but hostilities were not  opened. A period of waiting then ensued to consider the position. Then, when there was an ultimatum, it was decided to relieve this ship in time before the ultimatum expired. In our view, the commanding officer there on the spot exercised a right judgment.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;16;Whoever was responsible managed to send that ship up the river almost exactly at zero hour.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;67;I am afraid the right hon. Gentleman could not have followed what I said, because it was pointed out that the voyage would have been completed 24 hours before zero hour. That is the reply to that. With regard to the allocation of ships and the rest, I do not think I could make any further statement on that. It is a matter we could well debate.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;190;Now that we have received this statement from the Government as to the facts, might we have an indication of what their reaction is upon them? We have suffered very serious injury and our prestige has been affected, except in regard to the valour of our men, and is this to be the end? What course do His Majesty's Government intend to pursue? I am not asking for a statement on this today, but it is obvious that a matter like this cannot be allowed to go away in default with a mere statement of the facts from the Prime Minister and with a passive acceptance of them by the House of Commons. Something more than that must be done. I am not pressing for an immediate statement, especially as one cannot say beforehand what it is necessary and right to do, but I should like to have an assurance from the Government that they will face this matter in a robust spirit and will make sure that the British flag is respected and that British lives are not flung away without Parliament pursuing the matter with vigour and attention.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;52;The right hon. Gentleman, I think, clearly recognised, as he said just now, that he could not expect a statement on that matter to be made today. I have said that I shall give the fullest information. The situation is still fluid, but certainly we shall make a statement on the position.

1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;108;On the first point, I have not got the exact date by me, but it was a considerable time ago. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will remember that the Chinese Government moved to Canton, that various changes in the Government took place, and that they subsequently came back to Nanking. For a considerable period of weeks, indeed I think months, there has been the passage of our ships and the ships of other nations up the Yangtse. I think one would be entitled to say that it was notified on every occasion and there was no objection. As a matter of fact, this practice has been allowed.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;36;The decision was announced in the House that we did not propose to withdraw our nationals, and that decision was taken in consultation with other nationals there.

1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;82;I think I tried to point out to the House that there had been this question of additional tension over a great period—that had been going on for a very long time with rumours of imminent crossings—and, therefore, they did as a matter of fact delay the ordinary relief because of the alleged termination of an armistice. Then there came the extension of the armistice and the opportunity was taken of that extension to effect the relief. I think that was right.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;108;I did not say that this was a routine matter on the kind of lines that one could either do it or not; there had to be the supplies and there had to be the relief, and the commander on the spot had to consider what was the time to do it. I have been through the dates very often, but this was the time selected as, otherwise, he might not have been able to reach them at all. He considered—and I. think he was right in thinking that, in view of the evidence available and actions of the past—that the relief could be effected during this pause.

I have already told the House that our information was that hostilities would not begin until the time given on the 21st. Had this firing not taken place before the ending of that armistice, there would have been no question of the ship being hit.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;43;I do not think that the hon. and gallant Member quite understands that we were engaged on a peaceful mission. We were not engaged in staging a punitive war, and the vessels were going up and down the Yangtse on their lawful occasion.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;20;I have already pointed out that American ships based at Shanghai had been up and down the Yangtse quite recently.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;16;I answered that we were not engaged in warfare; we were engaged in a peaceful mission.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;25;Every possible effort will be made to get the names, and the fullest possible information will be given as soon as the names come in.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;156;With regard to the question of a Debate on these matters, I feel that there are several matters on which the Government will wish to make a statement later. I have indicated them and, therefore, I do not wish to press for an adjournment of the House today, but we shall accept the offer of the Prime Minister to discuss, through the usual channels, a Debate upon this issue in the near future. Because it has many aspects, I should like to make it absolutely clear that whatever criticism we may male of what I may call the unfortunate handling of a difficult situation, which has led our people to lose their lives, that in no wise detracts from our resentment at the atrocious outrage of which we have been the victims, or from our determination to press the Government to take effective steps to make sure that we are treated with respect in the future.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;48;As I have told the right hon. Gentleman, we are perfectly willing to have a Debate. We want to take every possible step to protect the communities in China—our British community; that is one of the points we have to bear in mind in dealing with this matter.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;91;I am not prepared to state in advance any steps with regard to the movement of any forces in this area. I am quite well aware that aircraft are used in warfare, but this was not a matter of warfare at all. There was no suggestion of making an attack anywhere at all. We were engaged in the peaceful process of bringing supplies up the river and it would have been quite unusual to have provided a bomber force or anything like that in conjunction with peaceful operations of that kind.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;90;I naturally leave this matter to be one for the commanders on the spot to deal with. I am not sheltering myself and I take full responsibility, but I am now being asked to answer detailed questions about how this operation of keeping a warship at Nanking should be conducted and how those reliefs should be done. I am repeating the point that we were engaged in a peaceful occupation. The suggestion seems to be that we were staging something like an operation. We were doing nothing of the kind.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;14;I cannot make any further statement except that all possible steps are being taken.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;28;I thought it was quite clear from my statement that we were unable to contact the Communist authorities. There could be no possible question of making any apology.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;36;I have already stated—and I am sure the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford will agree—that whatever steps we are taking, we cannot make a public announcement of the exact steps that we are taking.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;8;I certainly could not answer that without notice.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;31;I thought I had already made it clear to the House that we did every possible thing to contact the Communist forces and that we could not get any message through.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;26;If my hon. Friend will study my statement he will see that that was an addition I made saying "afterwards"; we had already done it before.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;45;Any decisions for action in this matter were taken by the men on the spot at the time. I have given full information to the House; I cannot give more information of what occurred than that which I have given. We simply have this information.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;29;This matter was a matter within the responsibiity of the local commander. He consulted with His Majesty's Ambassador, but there was no reference back here before action was taken.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;16;No one has yet pointed out exactly what the aircraft would have done in this matter.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;79;In any further Debate I am quite prepared to answer any questions. All I can say now is that this was a matter which was decided by the authorities on the spot. No suggestion or order was given from here that aircraft either should or should not be used. This was a matter in which, whatever operations were undertaken, were undertaken by those on the spot. In my view they took the right line in the decision they took.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;34;Are not the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Defence in close touch with the men on the spot? Ought they not to be following this situation and able to make—
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;36;What did the hon. Member say? Are those right hon. Gentlemen keeping in close touch, instead of leaving it to the men on the spot, and so being confronted with an unfortunate episode of this character?
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;33;I am quite sure the right hon. Gentleman would not think it right that day-to-day meticulous orders should be given to local commanders to carry out. No commander would wish to have them.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;96;Would it not have been right for the Admiralty authorities and the Government, when' they had information that this ship was to proceed up the river, and when the Communists had been entrenched along, or in strong occupation of, the north bank for weeks before, and when an armistice was expiring in a few hours—would it not have been right for them to have been in the closest touch with their officers on the spot, instead of throwing the whole burden on them, and expecting that they could get off behind them for all their muddle?
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;31;I am not prepared to take that from the right hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Gentleman knows quite well that there has been this difficult situation for weeks along the Yangtse.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;1;Yes.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;85;He knows that there have been rumours of crossings, and rumours of an armistice. We are keeping in touch with the situation, but a particular occasion like this is one for decision. There is no question of sheltering behind any commander on the spot. The commander on the spot took action. I approve his action. I support his action. That does not say that all the time from the Admiralty, the man on the spot, who knows the exact conditions, should be receiving detailed orders.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;7;He is in London at the moment.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;6;No, I cannot answer that now.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;4;No aircraft at Shanghai.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;2;Hong Kong.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;29;The hon. and gallant Gentleman does not quote me correctly. I said that no one on the Opposition side had suggested exactly what they could have done about it.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;25;I cannot answer as to the exact time in detail without notice. If the hon. Gentleman will put down a Question I shall answer it.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;5;I did not say that.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;10;I used the words "chicken-hearted," but not in that context.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;78;The hon. Member is repeating a very old slander. Everybody knows that the vote against the Estimates was a vote against Government policy and not for disarmament.  If the hon. Member will look back, he will find that that attitude was taken by prominent Members of most parties. It was never intended to register a vote for disarmament. I think it is unfortunate that such a statement, which was put about for party purposes, should be repeated now.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;1;rose—
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;291;The Government opened this Debate with a speech by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. It has run for two days, and I think that perhaps it is appropriate that a Minister of the Crown should speak at this time and answer some of the points which have been made in the Debate. We have had a very interesting discussion, and, if I may say so, a much more representative discussion than we have had for some time. There has been a tendency for debates on general subjects, in my view, to be left too much to one or two Members who are not necessarily very representative of the opinions of the House of Commons. To-day and yesterday we have had some real debate; there has been the play of debate and answer from side to side of the House. The hon. Member for Eye (Mr. Granville) ranged over a large number of topics. I thought that some of them had been dealt with rather more specifically and coherently by other Members, and I propose to deal with them in saying something of other speeches. It struck me at one point in his speech that he rather recalled the old fable of the  fly that sat on a cartwheel and said, "Gracious, what a dust I raise!" because it seemed as if everything that had happened had been due to him. I was rather surprised when he suggested that a year ago we ought to have had the kind of arrangement that we have with the United States of America now. He must realise that the kind of arrangement you can have between two Allies is different from that which you can have between a neutral State and a belligerent.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;204;I do not think that is a very valuable interruption. The hon. Member has verified the point I made. The only other distinctive point he made was one which the Prime Minister has dealt with. That was the complicated and difficult question of the working between the different parts of the British Commonwealth in regard to War Cabinet representation: The hon. Member a little tends to assume that when he puts forward a view it is the view of all the Dominions. The Dominions are separate and distinct nations, and it is a mistake to think that there is a Dominion view that ought to be heard. The Dominions are equal with us, and they have their distinctive views. It is a mistake to think that necessarily they all take the same view of what form of machinery should be set up, or, if they did, that that view was the view put forward by the hon. Member. I do not desire to carry the matter further, because it is a delicate matter, but the hon. Members does sometimes assume that he knows more than the Dominion Governments and than those members of the Government who have been sitting in Cabinet with Dominion Ministers.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;11;I am afraid that is what the hon. Member did suggest.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;45;I certainly saw a statement. There was a statement, which we can look up in the OFFICIAL REPORT, very much on those lines. I have also seen it in a report of one of the hon. Member's weekend speeches, which are always very well reported.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;57;The assumption of the hon. Member was that the incapacity of the Government did not allow them to be strong enough at all points. [Interruption.] Let us have it clear. I have a quotation from a speech made by the hon. Member on 13th November, in which he discussed this very thing and in which he said: 
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;110;Quite. He took the view that we should put our Forces in to support Russia. How much stronger would his case have been if he could have said that our Forces were immobilised in the Far East. He was not thinking of the Far East. He was thinking that rather than divide our Forces it might be better to let everything go in the Near East and throw everything into Russia. That is a sound strategic line, but it is a very different thing from going around and telling people that it is only the fault of the Government that we cannot have enough Forces. That is a curious optimism.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;15;Perhaps my hon. Friend is looking at the wrong page. This is what he said: 
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;24;It is always possible for the hon. Member to vie with himself, so to speak, but I take it that he really intended that.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;147;Yes. My hon. Friend is the man who, himself, shows a lack of strategic judgment. Upon all those points he has never thought out what the problem was He has thought that it was so easy, and that everything was a mistake, because he has never realised the kind of thing we have been up against. We have been up against a tremendous military machine and now we are up against another great military machine, and the hon. Member says that we have made great mistakes in our strategic judgments. I wonder what that means? Does it mean that, a year ago, the hon. Member would have put all our available forces into Singapore? Is that what he thinks would be sound strategic judgment? Or perhaps his sound strategic judgment would have said that we must not put troops into Libya but must keep them at home.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;7;Is that a matter of naval strategy?
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;100;That may be, so, but we are bound to rely upon the expert advice of experienced naval officers. [AN HON. MEMBER: "We judge by results."] That is the danger of judging by results. In all war there is nothing more dangerous than to judge entirely by results, without considering conditions. War is not betting on a certainty. Every great commander, whether at sea or on land, has had to take risks. When those risks have come off, people say "wonderful strategic judgment." If something does not come off, every person who knows nothing about it says, "shocking bad strategic judgment."
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;331;I would prefer to get the views, which I have not yet got, of the responsible naval officers rather than to rely on the a priori view of the hon. and gallant Member, even though he also has had a naval career. Then there is the hon. Member for Kidderminster. He is another Member with rose-coloured spectacles. He said that we were deceived about the position in the Far East. He has had great experience, but I do not think he could ever have been deceived had he looked at the situation. No Member who looked at this matter on the map, and considered the forces which Japan had, could have been deceived into thinking it was easy to defend the Malay Peninsula. The hon. Member said, "We have been deceived." I gather he was deceived because a general, in an Order of the Day to his troops, did not say, "We are in an awful position; we shall be beaten." I am sure he would not form his judgment on that. He knew perfectly well that the position in the Pacific depended upon command of the sea and that we had not got that. The command of the sea went very badly for us after those first attacks. When you consider the defence of that long peninsula, you must realise that you could put your troops in there, but if you had not got command of the sea—and that coast is a very long one—you would be faced with the possibility of being outflanked. He asked: Had we noticed Singora? Of course we had, but it was in Thailand. Thailand was not British territory; it was under the influence of Japan but was still an independent country. Of course, we had our plans made, but could we have attacked Thailand and brought war upon us from Japan without any assurance of United States support? In that case, Singora would have been only a trap. These things, believe me, are considered.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;157;Of course we made our preparations there. But, as I say, the defence of Malaya depended on sea power. We were weak there. Could we, then, go out and invite attack by telling everybody that we were frightfully weak there? I have never concealed from anybody the dangers and difficulties we saw in connection with Japan, but is it a right thing to state that publicly and invite attack by saying, "This is a very weak place. Japan, come in"? The hon. Member for Seaham took the line, I gather, that what we gave to Russia was small, that 1,000 tanks or 1,000 aircraft would be very small, and a great deal of his speech was devoted to the question of our supply. It was not until the very end of that speech that the most vital factor of all, though it is the subject on which he has very great knowledge, that is, the shipping question—
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;119;If the hon. Member had joined us, we should have been glad of his help. The short answer is, that what he does not seem to realise is that the shipping position invalidated the whole of the rest of his speech. That is what conditions how much stuff you can send out, at what time, and what operations you can carry on. What is the good of pointing the finger of scorn at us and saying, "You have even less shipping than when the war started," after we had the Battle of the Atlantic, after we had carried supplies to the Far East and the Near East and everywhere else, after we had had tremendous attacks on our Fleet?
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;13;No, I am saying that the hon. Member is ignoring that tremendous Service.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;54;The hon. Member may not think so, but I thought that the whole of the first half of his speech, which was one long sneer, was vitiated by the fact that he did not realise this vital part of our war effort, and that the existence of this difficulty made nonsense of his argument.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;246;I do not mind criticism. And I shall never lack it while the hon. Member is about. Another point that has been raised is whether we are making full use of the man-power of Asia. That question was raised by the hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. Haden Guest), my right hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh, and other Members. It is true that there is a great reservoir of men in the Indies, Malaya, and elsewhere, but the mass of them are untrained and unarmed. Everybody knows that after our losses in France we were hard put to it to arm our Regular troops, much less our Home Guard, for the defence of this country. Everyone will agree that that armament had to have priority. Secondly, we had to arm for the Libyan campaign.  We had to build up our Army. Obviously, you have to allot arms to the people who are to be trained first and who are nearest the most immediate point of danger. If those arms had been sent out for large armies in Malaya or India, Members of this House would have got up to ask why we had not armed the Home Guard. The second point is that, while there has been an immense increase of recruiting for the Indian Army, the amount of troops that could be raised at one time is necessarily restricted by the amount of the training cadres we have of—the amount of trained personnel.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;28;At that time there was tremendous pressure upon machine tools everywhere. We had to get anything we could from America, and we could not scrape up enough here.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;321;We have also to make use of trained workers on the spot. After Dunkirk it was a bit of a hurried job. The hon. Member for South Croydon seemed to have very bitter memories of the time when he was an Under-Secretary and that an under-secretary's life is not a happy one, and I gather that he seemed to know surprisingly little about the working of government. It is not very sensible to make the kind of suggestion that at the Defence Committee the Chiefs of Staff sit round silently and listen to long lectures by the Prime Minister, and because they are officers they are afraid to open their mouths. That is entirely untrue. No Chief of Staff, no First Lord and no Chief of the Air Staff would be fit to hold his job unless he was prepared to argue his case and put it freely and without fear before the Committee of Defence. I can assure hon. Members that the imaginary picture drawn by the hon. Member for South Croydon is entirely untrue. I do not think that attitude is very fair when at the same time the Prime Minister is represented as someone who will never listen to anybody else and as a dictator. Believe me, that is quite wrong. The Prime Minister is not a person who will take exception to people arguing nor is he a person who claims that apart from the rest of the Government his word is good all the time. As a matter of fact, he is one man working in a team. I suggest it is not a good thing to hear Members suggesting that the Prime Minister is a dictator. It is not very helpful when we are fighting against a dictatorship. The Prime Minister has always been a sound democratic man and a sound House of Commons man, and anybody less like a dictator you could not find.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;24;I mean not only generalised good will but specialised good will. Believe me, the Government have not an absolutely closed mind on this question.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;198;Certainly, I have always considered them. I think the principles I put forward were perfectly sound, and I have only to modify them in accordance with actual conditions as I find them. I think the hon. Member for Seaham will find that he will have to do the same when he comes to apply his theories, should he ever take office. As I have said, the Government have not closed their minds on this question of the organisation of production, but I think it is a mistake to think that all the difficulties can be got rid of by putting in a kind of superman to run the whole thing. I notice that the hon. Member for the Eye Division of Suffolk at one time appealed to the Chancellor to look at the matter from a monetary point of view and at another time to a Minister to look at it from a production point of view. I say, frankly, that while we must keep down costs and so on, the things that matter most are machinery, materials and man-power rather than pounds, shillings and pence. That is the point of view which must be borne in mind.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;75;Two years ago we borrowed another £1,000 million sterling from them, or nearly four billion dollars. I asked the other day a rhetorical question, "What are dollars?" Dollars are the result of the toil and the skill of the American working man, and he is willing to give them on a very large scale to the cause of rebuilding our broken world. In many cases he gives them without much prospect of repayment. Shabby moneylenders!
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;131;I am capable of deciding for myself. That evil can always be corrected by production. Where prices rise in spite of abundance, it is not a sign of evil, but often of strength. It must have been a heart-shaking decision of the American Government and of the President, who has great executive power, to abandon price controls and, as it were, throw the reins upon the horse's neck. The strong horse is pulling the wagon out of the mire. I know what many hopes are on the opposite side of the House, but they will not be cheered by the results. We have a strong horse too. He is not so large but he is strong. Alas, he is bitted and bridled and hobbled and haltered till he can hardly move.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;20;I merely recited the history of those days, and that is the latest precedent which is available upon the subject.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;277;It must be clear-almost clear enough for the right hon. Gentleman, even in his most comprehending moments. The object and spirit of the Parliament Act was not to enable the House of Lords to veto the will of the people, but to make sure that the will of the people was, in fact, made effective. For this purpose the life of a House of Commons was reduced from seven to five years, and a provision was inserted to enable a Bill to be carried forward under the Parliament Act procedure across a General Election. The Dissolution of Parliament in no way affects the efficacy of the Parliament Act. No Government are hampered by it in carrying through their legislation unless they are afraid that the people will not support them at the polls. The fact that the Government now wish to shorten the term of the suspensory powers of the second Chamber proves conclusively that they fear they would be defeated at a General Election. What they are, therefore, trying to do is not to give effect to the will of the people, but to carry through their party legislation irrespective of the will of the people. This is not democracy. It is  authoritarianism. [An HON. MEMBER: "What an incredible muddle."] I quite understand that may be the hon. Member's condition. Total powers are to be given to any Government obtaining power at a General Election, no matter how abnormal the conditions of that election, to carry whatever legislation they choose during their five years spell, irrespective of whether the people wish for that legislation, and irrespective of whether the Government still have their confidence or not.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;155;We will come to that in a minute. What is now proposed is, virtually, single-chamber Government, and the granting to the Cabinet, which already has taken it in time of peace, the whole of the arbitrary wartime powers and regulations—a monstrous invasion of our liberties and a vile breach of faith between man and man who have to work together. What they are now proposing to do is to obtain for the Cabinet irresistible power to pass any Measures they may wish to bring forward, without regard to the will of the people or to their own foundation in public confidence. This is a formidable issue to fling out at this time of economic crisis—at this time when, in full peace, despotic wartime powers are ruling—and to be flung out, not as a result of grave historic and prolonged constitutional controversies, but as a cheap, paltry, disreputable deal between jarring nonentities in a divided Administration.

1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;142;Will the right hon. Gentleman be so kind as to allow me to direct his attention also to the comparison which I made, because after the first world war there was no havoc by bombing? There were not a million houses knocked down, and hardly any damage here. I do not remember that housing was at that time one of the leading questions. We had many other matters, and grave labour questions, but I do not think there is any comparison between that situation and this, when we have a million houses destroyed. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why, not now but even in the year 1949, only 140,000 houses are to be constructed here, with all our efforts, when before the war, with no particular effort at all, just in the normal working, as many as 350,000 houses were completed?

Gentleman should realise that Palestine is a mandated area, and as he and his colleagues have broken their pledges to the Zionists, there was no moral reason why we should not, and every practical reason why we should, give the Mandate back to the United Nations organisation.

1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;83;The right hon. Gentleman must be very hard up to find something to say. Since when have I been in favour of the House of Lords having the power of Dissolution? I have never heard of such a doctrine and I should be absolutely opposed to it. They have a control given them by Parliament over legislation, but they have absolutely no power to determine the length of the sittings of this House, nor when there should be an appeal to the country.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;69;I must really clear the right hon. Gentleman's mind. If a Measure is sent back under the suspensory veto of the House of Lords, there is no obligation upon the Government to go to the country. There is no obligation to go to the country before the expiration of their full normal term, and they lose nothing by that because the procedure of the Parliament Act carries on properly.

Such expressions of opinion by officials would, usually, have regard to technical aspects only. Of course, in an emergency, exceptions may be made. The principle of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament is paramount.

1948-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-3-24;Clause 3—(Adaptation Of 7 & 8 Geo 6 C 41);98;Is it not a fact that when the Boundary Commission presented its report, its functions were discharged, and in the main it has stated its opinion as to the fair distribution of the seats? Is it not a fact, also, that the Government desired to know whether the Boundary Commission would deal further with the matter, and were they not informed that the Commission could not act in a collective capacity any more? Were they not then reduced to obtaining the individual advice and opinion of former members of a Boundary Commission, which in this matter was defunct?
1948-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-3-24;Clause 3—(Adaptation Of 7 & 8 Geo 6 C 41);4;I think it is.

I have not in the slightest degree concealed in public speech how much I regretted the course of events in Egypt. But I had not held my mind closed to the tremendous changes that have taken place in the whole strategic position in the world which make the thoughts which were well-founded and well knit together a year ago utterly obsolete, and which have changed the opinions of every competent soldier that I have been able to meet.

The position is that all available shipbuilding berths in South Shields are occupied with merchant ship building orders. The volume of ship repair work is bound to fluctuate and the policy is to spread such work over the country as far as possible. The facilities at South Shields will be fully borne in mind both for repair work and naval conversion work. All will be needed.

When Lord Alexander comes back I am sure we shall want to hear everything he has to tell us in the Government; and also a statement on this, I think, valuable mission of his must certainly be an important feature in our discussions here.
1943-7-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-27;Italy And The War;194;The House will have heard with satisfaction of the downfall of one of the principal criminals of this desolating war. The end of Mussolini's long and severe reign over the Italian people undoubtedly marks the close of an epoch in the life of Italy. The keystone of the Fascist arch has crumbled, and, without attempting to prophesy, it does not seem unlikely that the entire Fascist edifice will fall to the ground in ruins, if it has not already so fallen. The totalitarian system of a single party, armed with secret police, engrossing to itself practically all the offices, even the humblest, under the Government, with magistrates and courts under the control of the executive, with its whole network of domestic spies and neighbourly informants—that system when applied over a long period of time, leaves the broad masses without any influence upon their country's destinies and without any independent figures apart from the official classes. That, I think, is a defence for the people of Italy—one defence—although there can be no real valid defence for any country or any people which allows its freedom and inherent rights to pass out of its own hands.

I do not think that we realised, when illness forced him to give up the position he was holding in this House, that that illness would so soon terminate fatally. I think that during his tenure of the Deputy-Chairmanship he had commanded the respect of the whole House. He was courteous, he understood the duties of the Chair, he was impartial, he served the House faithfully. I am sure that we are all very sorry that he had no time to rest after those arduous duties, and the sympathy of all of us will go out to his wife and son.

The late Mr. Beaumont discharged the difficult and delicate duties in the Chair at the Table with complete impartiality, with great knowledge of the rules of the House, with much indulgence and courtesy towards Members, and with a full understanding of the traditions of this House which are not contained in any book or code of rules. On this side of the House we felt indebted to him for the necessary services which he rendered, and we share with the Prime Minister and the Government party, to the full, the deep regret with which we have learned of his untimely death. He died in harness. The interval between his presiding over the Debates in this House and the ending of his life was very short indeed, but at any rate all his days, of which we have so much knowledge in the House, were well spent and were to the credit of those great institutions on which in this difficult period the life and freedom of Britain depend.

There will be further changes, not only consequential changes, among the Undersecretaries, but these I have not yet had time to consider in all their bearings. After nearly two years of strain and struggle it was right and necessary that a Government called into being in the crash of the Battle of France should undergo both change and reinvigoration. I regret very much the loss of loyal and trusted colleagues, with whom I have come through so many hard times and who readily placed their resignations in my hand in order to facilitate a reconstruction of the Government. They had, of course, no greater share of responsibility than the rest of the Administration for the disasters which have fallen upon us in the Far East. Nevertheless, I am sure that we have achieved a more tensely-braced and compact Administration to meet the new dangers and difficulties which are coming upon us, and I believe that that is the general opinion of the House and of the country

This mighty impact fell upon our wide, prosperous but lightly-defended possessions and establishments throughout the Far East, all of which had, rightly, been kept at the very lowest level on account of the imperative requirements of the European and African theatres. I saw that some gentlemen who escaped from Penang announced to the world with much indignation that there was not a single antiaircraft gun in the place. Where should we have been, I would like to know, if we had spread our limited anti-aircraft guns throughout the immense, innumerable regions and vulnerable points of the Far East instead of using them to preserve the vital life of our ports and factories here and of our fortresses which were under continuous attack and all our operations with the field Armies in the Middle East?

With this object in view, a number of appointments have been made, under arrangements concerted generally by the Historical Section of the War Cabinet Office, formerly of the Committee of Imperial Defence. I am circulating in the OFFICIAL REPORT a list of the Departments covered by these arrangements, which may be extended as thought necessary to other Departments whose war-time activities could with advantage be recorded in this way.

That Report is under consideration by the Government; it involves complicated and important issues, and no statement can yet be made. When the Government has come to its conclusions on the Report it will consider whether any inferences can be drawn as to modifications in by-election arrangements in war-time. While it is the wish of His Majesty's Government that all possible eligible persons should have the right to record their votes, I think it proper to warn the House that the technical and practical difficulties may be formidable. It is in any case not possible for the Government to reach any conclusion as to by-elections meantime, so that I am not able to give an answer of a favourable character to the hon. Member's request. In the meantime constituencies without the services of a Member will naturally expect us to take the usual steps to enable the  vacancies to be filled, and I therefore trust the House will assent to the Writ being issued.

Gentleman has declared himself, after 18 months of protracted delay, incapable of offering any solution? How does he justify keeping 100,000 British soldiers in Palestine, who are needed here, and spending £30 million to £40 million a year from our diminishing resources upon this vast apparatus of protraction and delay?

But I am entitled to ask the question whether what has been announced today does not mean that at least a year will pass, while the British Government remain, on their own confession, without any solution of the Palestine problem, before any solution is provided from another quarter; and  whether that is not exposing us to an unduly heavy burden, both in the absorption of our manpower, and in the further depletion of our financial resources?

The kind of criticism we have had to-day, some of it very searching, is the kind of criticism that the Government not only accept but welcome. All the same, the House will, permit me perhaps to point out that the way in which this Debate came about was calculated to give one the feeling of a challenge to the security of the Administration, and, from the point of view of the advantage to the country, that raises serious considerations. There were all kinds of paragraphs and reports which appeared in the papers about the grave uneasiness and unrest, stating that a Debate on Crete must take place. The parties were demanding it, the Labour party, the Liberal party and members of the Conservative party were demanding it, and there must be a full accounting, an inquest held, and so forth. That being so, one is bound to take a serious view because of the interests which are confided into our care.

Friend in some way, but it appears he wished to continue the argument. I am dealing not with the particular equipment of the troops who went to France, who naturally drained the rest of our Forces, but the fact remains that the equipment of our Army at that time, and at the outbreak of war, was of the most meagre and deficient character, and that the deficiencies made themselves most marked—and still make themselves most marked—in the very type of weapons for which there is the greatest possible demand. I could give facts and figures upon this point if we were in private which would, I think, leave no dispute upon the subject. I am not throwing all the blame for this upon my right hon. Friend at all—certainly not —but I think it is only fair, when he himself comes forward and sets himself up as an arbiter and judge, and speaks so scornfully of the efforts of some others who have inherited his dismal legacy, I think when he speaks in this way—he has a great responsibility in the matter—it is only fair to point out to him that he is one of the last people in this country entitled to take that line.

1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;200;The hon. Member for Eye (Mr. Granville) had better return to his lucubrations in constitutional experiment, which exercise his mind so much at present. So much for the difficulty in which we stand in the matter of the anti-aircraft guns. The output is at last rapidly expanding, but the fact remains that our outfits are incomparably inferior in numbers to those possessed by the Germans, and every claim has to be weighed against every other claim. Another general question which may fairly be asked is, "Why have we not got much stronger and much larger air forces in the Middle East?" I can only say this: From the moment when the Battle of Britain was decided in our favour, in September and October of last year, by the victories of our fighters, we have been ceaselessly sending aircraft as fast as possible to the Middle East, by every route and by every method. During the present year, as our strength in the air has grown, we have not been hampered in this matter, as we were in the case of the antiaircraft guns, by lack of aircraft. The problem has been to send them to the Eastern theatre of war.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;212;Not transportation in the sense of shipping tonnage, but in the sense of the time that it takes to transfer under the conditions of the present war. It is not aircraft, but transportation, which is the limiting factor at this end. I have dealt with anti-aircraft guns; I have dealt with aircraft. As to the disposition of our Air Force in the Middle East, it is primarily a matter for the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East, although His Majesty's Government share to the full their responsibility for whatever is done. I might refer again to what was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Lewes (Rear-Admiral Beamish) about the importance of coordination between the Services. It is carried to a very high pitch. The Chief Air Officer lives in the same house in Cairo as the Commander-in-Chief. They are there side by side. The Naval Commander-in-Chief has to be at sea very often. He has to be at Alexandria. But the very closest association exists between these branches. The idea that any one of these problems would be studied by one of these commanders only, without the closest association with the other two is quite an illusory idea, and I can really assure my hon. Friend on that point.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;273;It is not so much a question of the final say. No disagreement that I know of has arisen. Obviously, the Army is the main factor in that business, and the Fleet is preserving the security of the Army on the seas, and preserving the command of the seas, and the Air is assisting the Army and the Fleet in all their functions. But in the event of any differences, they can be settled in a few hours by reference here. These Commanders-in-Chief have to  settle it among themselves, although we share to the full responsibility for whatever is done. It must not be forgotten that apart from the effort we made in Greece, which was very costly in aircraft, the situation in Iraq, in Palestine, and potentially in Syria, as well as the winding-up of the Abyssinian story, all made very heavy demands upon our aircraft, and the situation in the Western Desert had also to be considered. Before any rational judgment could be formed upon the disposition of our Air Force and the consequent failure to supply an adequate Air Force for Crete, it would be necessary, as in the case of the anti-aircraft guns, to know not only what are our whole resources, but also what is the situation in these other theatres, which were all, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith) pointed out, all intimately interrelated, and it is no use trying to judge these matters without full knowledge, and that full knowledge obviously cannot be made public, and ought not to be spread outside the narrowest circle compatible with the execution of operations.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;78;I would have liked very much to have stopped them, and in some cases I have reduced them in number. I think it is a very risky thing to ask a professional officer, naval, military or air, to give a weekly expatiation on the war when, in the nature of things, although he may be very accomplished in his profession, he cannot know and ought not to know the facts as they are understood at the secret meetings.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;214;I am very glad to see the feeling in the House on the subject, because, on the other side, one is appealed to ceaselessly to give more information, to make the war more interesting to the people, and to tell them more about what is going on. But it is not possible for the head of the Government or even for the Chiefs of Staff to vet—to use a slang term—beforehand these detailed weekly statements which are made. I think the matter must certainly be reconsidered. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] As I have said, no one had any illusions about the tremendous scale of the air-borne attack, the greatest ever delivered in the world, or thought that we should resist it without any but the most restricted air support on our side. That is the fact. It is not a nice case, but it is the fact. Let us look at the anatomy of this battle of Crete which was undertaken in those bleak circumstances. We hoped that the 25,000 to 30,000 good troops—I am making it a little vague—with artillery and a proportion of tanks, aided by the Greek forces, would be able to destroy the parachute and glider landings of the enemy and prevent him from using the airfields or the harbours.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;135;I certainly will. The right hon. Gentleman associated himself with a very strong movement there has been for a much greater development of the air force which is actually associated with the Army. Last year, when we were considering our affairs, the great need was to multiply fighters and  bombers. It became an enormously important matter. Nevertheless, portions of the Army co-operation squadrons were associated with the military forces, but not on the scale which was desirable or to the extent which was desirable. I think it is of the utmost consequence that every division, especially every armoured division, should have a chance to live its daily life and training in a close and precise relationship with a particular number of aircraft that it knows and that it can call up at will and need.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;137;Certainly, for the purposes of everything that is a tactical operation. It was not possible last year to provide it on a large scale without trenching on other domains which were more vital to our safety, but it is the intention to go forward upon that path immediately and to provide the Army with a larger number, a considerably larger number, of aeroplanes suited entirely to the work they have to do, and above all to the development of that wireless connection between the ground forces and the air which the Germans have carried to such an extraordinary point of perfection. If this had been done in Crete, it would not have made any difference to the event there, because the numbers there for the purpose of cooperating with the troops could not have altered the event.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;103;I read into the word the meaning most people read into it; when he said productivity was falling off, I took it to mean not (he effort of each man but the general production. I felt I must contradict his statement today because it happens that I have heard from two foreign countries in the course of the morning of the very serious effect which this statement produced upon opinions there; how it was published rapidly throughout Spain, for instance, and given the greatest prominence coming as it did from an ex-Secretary of State. It was said to be exercising a bad effect.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;130;I do not see any difficulty in reconciling that. The Minister might be urging the men to make greater efforts, he might say that this particular lot of airfields were falling behind, what the programme actually was, but that is quite a different thing from saying that the productivity of our factories is falling off. I must say I do not think we are in a sufficiently safe position to allow ourselves the full luxuries of vehement statements upon these very grave matters. As I say, we have many things we may be thankful for. In the  first place, we have not been overwhelmed by the air attack; and our production, far from being beaten down by the disorganisation of that attack, has been increasing at a very high rate.

Gentleman's answer as making it clear that the Opposition in no way accept any responsibility for the state of national defence by the fact of these conversations. At any rate, it seems most necessary to emphasise that. We have not thought it right to have a Debate for some time upon national defence, and I find great difficulty in coming to any conclusions upon that without knowing for how long this Parliament is going on. It certainly would not be worth while addressing the present House on the subject unless its sittings are to be prolonged into the late summer. The right hon. Gentleman must not take it, and it must not be taken by the public outside, that the fact—[HON. MEMBERS: "Speech."] I am asking the right hon. Gentleman a question.
1949-11-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-11-28;Defence (Talks);43;Am I right in assuming, Sir, that the right hon. Gentleman will not take it that this absence of Debate and anything that he has said in his statement, in the slightest degree commits us to approval of or agreement with the Government?
1949-11-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-11-28;Defence (Talks);27;I think that the condition of these talks was quite well understood. The Government do not share responsibility in these matters with any other person at all.

It would involve a very serious and complicated process to depart from this simple principle and I could not undertake to do so without a very much more detailed examination of all the reactions affecting individuals that would be involved. Two awards could not be given to the Army unless a similar duplication were permitted to the Navy and the Air Force. The complications are therefore obvious.

I think it would be a difficult question to thrash out in public, from various points of view. I think that there is a good deal to be said on both sides of the argument. On the whole I have become convinced that it is an advantage to the United States to have contacts which in our case no longer exist.

Might I submit to him that this is a question to which considerable sentimental importance attaches? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that General Gordon was not only a military commander, who gave his life for his country, but, in addition, was considered very widely throughout this country as a model of a Christian hero, and that very many cherished ideals are associated with his name? Would not the right hon. Gentleman consider whether this statue, which, I am told, is a very fine work of art, might not receive special consideration, even though the monuments to some famous admirals were put in some different place? General Gordon was a figure outside and above the ranks of military and naval commanders.

1941-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-21;Members Of Parliament (Visits To Ireland);161;I am not complaining, because I think that the whole character of the Debate has been upon a high level and has been of value and importance. I do not think there are such very great differences between us. Certainly I must say, as I have been referred to in the Debate, that there is no part of the powers conferred on His Majesty's Government in this time of trial that I view with greater repugnance than these powers of exceptional process against the liberty of the subject without the ordinary safeguards which are inherent in British life. Those high-sounding familiar phrases like "Habeas Corpus," "petitioner's right," "charges made which are known to the law," and "trial by jury"—all these are part of what we are fighting to preserve. We all care about them and understand them, and we are determined that they shall not be in-roaded upon by anything except the need of self-preservation which arises in time of war.

1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);12;I propose, with Mr. Speaker's permission, to make a statement on Burma.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);15;Does this statement mean that we pay and we go, or only that we go?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);79;The statement does not mean that we go. It means that the people of Burma have the right to decide in the future whether they should stay in the Commonwealth or go outside. Therefore, there is no decision to go. Secondly, with regard to finance, it is interim finance, and it concerns certain interest-free loans, which were decided upon by  the previous Government, and have been continued by this Government, for the reconstruction of Burma in the interim period.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);18;We have to pay the money irrespective of whether Burma remains in the Commonwealth and Empire or not?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);88;I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will remember that at the present moment Burma is within the Commonwealth, and that Burma suffered seriously in the war, both by damage from the enemy and by damage which was ordered by His Majesty's Government for the purpose of delaying the enemy. It is, therefore, perfectly reasonable that we should continue to assist Burma irrespective of what future decisions may be taken. The right hon. Gentleman will find the full details set out in the annexe to the White Paper.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);16;The answer to my question is that we are first to pay, and then to go?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);67;The right hon. Gentleman's logical faculty seems to have deserted him. There is no decision here to go. There is no decision to pay in the future. There are interim payments which are in the form of loans, and the decision as to whether to go or to stay is for the Burmese people. It really cannot be reduced down to a proposition which is entirely inaccurate.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);22;May I ask the Prime Minister whether he will, in the near future, afford us an opportunity of debating this dismal transaction?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);69;Certainly, but I think the House will agree that there should first be given time for the Burmese Delegation to return to Burma and discuss the matter. I am hoping the Debate will be no more dismal than was the Debate of 41 years ago in which the right hon. Gentleman had to suffer from some criticisms from those gentlemen who then sat on that side of the House.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);26;I have not had any suggestion made. I have no reason to think that all proper precautions will not be taken to conduct the elections properly.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);54;The noble Lord is correct. I would not like to say how many times in the course of the discussions I emphasised the point that all we could do was to make an agreement with them, and propose a certain line and make certain proposals, but that the decision must rest with this House.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);39;Certainly, there will be no attempt to delay. On the contrary, we hope to get this forward as quickly as possible. There should not be any delay in coming to a decision. There is no intention whatever of delaying.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);100;No, there have been various statements made, rather contradictory, but there is a conference being held this month in which the various frontier peoples will be meeting, and I hope that, either at that conference or at a subsequent conference, we shall get a full indication of their views. With regard to the Karens—I take it the right hon. Gentleman means the Karens in the  plains and not those in Karenni—there was no specific Karen Delegation, because this was a Delegation of members of the Executive Council. The proposal is that the Karens should be represented in the Constituent Assembly.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);17;They were two representatives who belonged to separate parties. I cannot say what numbers they actually represented.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);69;It will be exploratory. There is a double thing here. We want to see that the people of Ministerial Burma and the people of the plains have a full opportunity of discussing the matter with one another, and we want to assure ourselves as to what are the views of the people of the frontier areas, and the mission is merely to facilitate things, and also to collect information.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);43;On the first point, I cannot say exactly how long. It would be useless to try to give a timetable, because we do not know. With regard to the other point, I think the agreement is in general accord with the Atlantic Charter.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);69;Is the right hon. Gentleman not aware, or does he not remember, that when we were asked in this House, after the Atlantic Charter, about its application to Eastern countries and. other parts of the British Empire, a very full and precise statement was made by me, from his place, to which he was a consenting party beforehand? Would he kindly refresh his memory some time by reading it?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);39;I will certainly refresh my memory on that, but as I remember, it's tenor was that we ourselves were carrying out the principles of the Atlantic Charter in the Empire and Commonwealth, because we were moving progressively towards self-government.

Before this latest pronouncement of theirs, His Majesty's Government had already departed from the Cripps Mission declaration of 1942, and they had departed from it in three major aspects. First, they had eliminated the stage of Dominion status. The Cripps Mission expressly said that the objective was the creation of a new Indian Union which would constitute a Dominion associated with the United Kingdom and the other Dominions by common allegiance to the Crown, but equal to them in every respect, in no way subordinated in any aspect of domestic or external affairs.

1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);63;That is so. Certainly it will be expected of him to make a statement. There is one point, however, on which we ought to have some information today, because it is material to the issues before us. Was the Viceroy in favour of the time limit, or was he not? I hope that we should have some information on that point, at least.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);12;We do not often find ourselves thinking on similar lines—not in agreement.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);315;David, keep quiet. [Laughter.] We are old allies, and do not interfere with each other when we are in action. As I say, I read the speech of the hon. Member for Gateshead. We do not often find ourselves in agreement or thinking along similar lines. Nor am I in agreement with much that he said last night. But it is a fact that I had already intended myself to strike the note of the United Nations being brought into the Indian problem. I have for some time pressed upon His Majesty's Government that, if they are unable to carry out their pledges in Palestine or keep order there, they should return their Mandate, or, at any rate, invoke the aid of U.N.O. to help them in their work; and that, after six or seven months' delay—a needless delay—they have actually done. Now, is it not difficult to resist the feeling that the same train of reasoning applies on a far greater scale and with much stronger force to India? We are told that we cannot walk out of Palestine because we should leave behind us a war between 600,000 Jews and 200,000 Arabs. How, then, can we walk out of India in 14 months and leave behind us a war between 90 million Muslims and 200 million caste Hindus, and all the other tribulations which will fall upon the helpless population of 400 million? Will it not be a terrible disgrace to our name and record if, after our 14 months' time limit, we allow one fifth of the population of the globe, occupying a region nearly as large as Europe, to fall into chaos  and into carnage? Would it not be a world crime that we should be committing, a crime that would stain—not merely strip us, as we are being stripped, in the material position—but would stain our good name for ever?
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);11;We are not likely to lose our tempers with each other.

1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);54;The right hon. Gentle man and his colleagues did make a great constructive contribution in the shape of a plan, both of procedure and long-term results. Whether they forced or pressed this on them we need not argue about, but they no doubt commended it to the Indians with all the address they had.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);93;I said nothing about Mr. Nehru except that he had very good reason to be a bitter enemy of all connected with Britain—very good reason. [HON. MEMBERS: "Men of straw."] That did not specially refer to Mr. Nehru, but it does refer to the political leaders, of all the Indian parties, who have no authority. I have certainly not made any personal attack upon Mr. Nehru, except to point out that he has good reason to be our bitterest enemy in that he has been for 10 or 12 years interned in gaol.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);85;I do not repent at all. I went out of my way, when I spoke on the last occasion on India, to draw attention to Mr. Nehru's courageous action in ordering the troops to fire on his own co-religionists in Bihar when the Government officers had failed in their duty. I have not said anything derogatory to his character, but he is an enemy of this country, and has every right to be if he chooses. That, I think, it is perfectly proper to say.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);50;On a point of Order, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I should very much have liked myself to refer to Lord Halifax's speech in the other House, but I understood the rule was that we could not make references to speeches in another place. I should be glad if the rule were relaxed.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);223;The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. R. A. Butler) has spoken with his usual care, courtesy, lucidity and knowledge on this subject. I think he started with one point on which I entirely agree with him, because, having sat through all the Debates prior to the 1935 Act, I am quite prepared to admit that the Conservative Party is as united on Indian questions as it was then. I have no doubt that this has been fully borne out in this Debate. We have had a very interesting Debate, illuminated, as Debates are in this House, by hon. Members who have great practical experience of this problem. I was very much impressed by the speeches by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Reed), the hon. and gallant Member for Sudbury (Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton), and the hon. and gallant Member for Down (Sir W. Smiles), whom I remember so well when I was in India and he was in Assam on the Legislative Council of the Assam Government. I noticed one thing—that the more recent  and the more complete the experience of hon. Members, the less were their speeches ready to condemn outright the decision of the Government. Indeed, as I pointed out, there were speeches in support of it that were not confined to this side of the House.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);143;We were near the end of the war, and were planning for the future, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman was as confident as I was of how well we were getting on at that time. [An HON. MEMBER: "What was the date?"] It was April, 1945, near the end of the war. We took this matter up with my right hon. Friends who went to India and, there, again, it was said that it would not be useful. I rather pressed it myself, because I thought some strengthening would be useful, but we were told that it would not be useful. But even if it were desired to strengthen slightly the British cadre, it really would not do what the right hon. Gentleman wanted. It is very strange for him, but I think he must have missed something here.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);2;In India.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);122;In India. I agree that they are not much interested. You have to govern India through educated Indians. You cannot suddenly take in members of the Depressed Classes, and put them in to govern a Province, or anything of that kind. You have to govern with Indian people, and they are the politically educated classes. As long as 18 years ago, when I was in India, I realised that the wave of nationalist feeling had extended beyond politicians. Nationalist feeling runs right through all the Indian classes. That is the reason why you cannot carry on against the will of the Indian people. All our advice has been to the effect that to strengthen the administration would not get over the difficulties.

The fact is, as everybody knows, that one cannot change the Hindu social system from outside by alien rule. These things have to be done by Indians, and whatever is put into treaties, as has been said, ultimately it rests upon the Indians themselves. I come to the point that was mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition—the moneylenders There is gross in equality of wealth in India, but unfortunately, that social and economic system was continued during all the time of our rule. We did not go in for the revolutionary business of turning out the land lords who do nothing whatever. We did something to repress the moneylenders, but not much. We accepted that social and economic system. Why are we told now, at the very end of our rule, that we must clear up all these things before we go, otherwise we shall betray our trust? If that trust is there, it ought to have been fulfilled long ago.

1953-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1953-5-07;Indo-China (Situation);21;I will try to deal with some aspects of this question when I open the debate on foreign affairs next week.
1953-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-07;Indo-China (Situation);7;I shall take all that into consideration.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);14;With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement to the House.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);79;—but these advances are spread very unevenly over industry. In many firms, and indeed in some whole industries, little or no advance in productivity has been made: if all were as good as the best our problem of production would be in a fair way to solution. If we are to seize the great opportunities for export which devaluation has opened to us, and keep up the standard of supply in the home market, we must increase our production.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);98;Naturally, it would be wrong and also mentally impossible to come to any conclusion upon the complicated and guarded statement—none the less of the gravest importance—which  the Prime Minister has made. I understand we are to have an opportunity during the present week of having a Debate on these matters, and we shall avail ourselves of the brief interlude there is to give the closest attention to what is proposed, and to do our utmost to see what is the advice which we on this side should tender to the House and the country at this serious juncture.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);33;That will, of course, be dealt with in the Debate on Wednesday and Thursday, but it was very fully dealt with by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);125;I think the right hon. Gentleman will get more information when he is able to study it a little more at leisure. I considered very carefully the question of whether one could issue a White Paper, but it is very difficult, because there is a very great range of economies coming into force at different times, and also past economies have to be brought in. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that one could not issue a White Paper without making it an enormously voluminous document. I think the matter will, of course, be opened out in Debate by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I put into my statement as much detail as I could, and I think it is quite sufficient for a Debate.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);3;That is so.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);30;I think that my hon. Friend's point, like so many other points that are being made, are points which would be better made in Debate than by question and answer.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);5;I really cannot, straight away.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);11;We are discussing the whole question of defence with our friends.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);18;I cannot say anything further on that point—no one could—than the Chancellor of the Exchequer said last week.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);19;Oh, no. Other economies are being made. Economies are being made all the time. [HON. MEMBERS: "What are they?"]
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);19;I have already pointed out that a complete review is being made of the whole question of the Forces.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);23;That is exactly what I did not say. I said that the subsidy would be withdrawn and the whole matter considered in February.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);30;I did not say that specifically. I said that we were reviewing the whole question and that it will fall into its place in the general defence of the country.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);16;I really do think it is. We have given this matter a good deal of consideration.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);8;All those matters are really matters for debate.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);24;The hon. Gentleman has missed the point. There was a vast mass of detail which it is difficult to bring into a White Paper.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);2;No, Sir.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);34;The hon. Gentleman knows well that there are laid before the House very detailed Estimates. He would not expect those all to be repeated. These figures will appear in the Estimates in due course.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);40;Can the right hon. Gentleman give us an assurance that this reduction of about £250 million which he has proposed will be a net reduction, or will it be overtaken and swamped by other aspects and elements of national expenditure?
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);8;It is intended to be a net reduction.

1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;53;Does the Prime Minister remember the very precise pledges which he gave about this important State of 17 million or 18 million people, that they would have the right to choose whether they would accede to Pakistan or to Hindustan—or India—and that, if not, they could remain a separate Dominion of the Crown?
1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;55;Is that not a very unrepresentative form of the precise pledges which were given to this House, that the State of Hyderabad and, I may add, the State of Kashmir, should have the right to choose which of the two Dominions in India they would accede to or, if not, to remain outside and separate?
1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;11;I was not asking about jurisdiction. I was asking about obligations.

1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);60;Its purpose was to relieve a considerable number of people from anxiety about their position in the country. It is quite true that it may take some time for them to adjust  their affairs in accordance with the new clemency extended to them, and that is a point on which the House may from time to time seek further information.
1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);14;My right hon. and learned Friend answered a Question earlier today on that subject.
1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);18;I am not sure. It may well have been that it was not asked specifically on that point.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);36;Subject to the usual procedure, the Order in Council transferring responsibilities from the Minister of  Supply to the Lord President of the Council will take effect on 1st January. Until then, the existing arrangements will continue.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);89;I have said that, after 1st January, the Minister of Works will answer Questions here on this subject on behalf of the Lord President of the Council. [An HON. MEMBER: "Not good enough."] You do not like that; you do not like the House of Lords at all. That will be the arrangement which will be made, but, with regard to the making of atomic weapons by the Ministry of Supply, Questions on that subject will, as hitherto, be answered by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);24;No, Sir. We have considered that a line should properly be drawn in this case, though not in every case, between research and supply.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);42;I understand that the Lord President of the Council is being placed in charge of this matter because it is a matter of major Government policy. Should not, therefore, the response in this House be made by a member of the Cabinet?
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);13;I think that the arrangement which has been made is the most convenient.
1953-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1953-11-17;Exchange Of Information;157;I have not quite completed the dispositions which will be made for answering Questions in the House generally upon the subject of atomic energy, I could not myself undertake to deal with this extremely specialised and complicated subject, and therefore I am going to propose to the House that a Minister shall be made specially chargeable. However, there are certain Questions which, though they appear to deal with the atomic issue, raise matters which are high diplomacy. This first one was naturally one which should be answered by the Minister of Supply, but I have asked my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to deal with the next two very complicated Questions. [AN HON. MEMBER:"Oh."] Certainly, we are very proud to have his assistance, and I hope that the hon. Member will remember how very much easier it is to put highly complex and difficult Questions upon the Order Paper than to give clear and positive answers.
1953-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-17;Exchange Of Information;38;I think that is rather ungrateful. I must have been too complimentary to the right hon. Gentleman. He has explained what harm any compliment from me did to him. I must really rake up a few more compliments.
1946-7-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-10;Food Surveys;14;Would the right hon. Gentleman state the number of persons in the clerical staff?
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Volunteer Reserve Officers (Promotions);60;The number of former members of the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve who have been promoted to the rank of temporary lieutenant, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, after a period of preliminary training, is about 400. The length of the training course has varied according to the qualifications which the officer already possessed and the appointment for which he was required.
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Volunteer Reserve Officers (Promotions);49;I regret that the information asked for by my hon. Friend in the first part of his Question is not available. Certain temporary officers are already serving in the rank of lieutenant-commander where their duties merit this rank, and such promotions will continue to be made in suitable cases.
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Volunteer Reserve Officers (Promotions);40;Yes, Sir. That problem is not confined to this class of officers or to the Admiralty, but certainly those, and other, aspects have to be taken into account in connection with promotions which are made in the emergency of war.
1940-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-7-18;Inventions And Suggestions;207;An immense number of suggestions and inventions are sent in to the various Departments connected with the prosecution of the war. It is the duty of each Department to examine those suggestions which deal with matters with which they are concerned, and to refer the others to the appropriate Department. I believe that, on the whole, considering the extreme pressure of the times, this work is well done by the research branches of the Departments. I should deprecate the idea that the scientists at the disposal of  the Government are tied by pre-conceived notions. I remember that, at the time when the magnetic mine appeared to be a menace, several hundred letters a day were received suggesting remedies. However, the Admiralty succeeded in solving the problem themselves almost as soon as they were able to deal with the correspondence about it. It would therefore be a mistake to assume that there is any lack of willingness or of ability to adopt new ideas. But this in no way implies that suggestions are not welcome. Correspondents in doubt about which Department to address should forward their suggestions to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which is under the special care of the Lord President of the Council.
1940-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-7-18;Inventions And Suggestions;132;It is very difficult indeed. I felt there was a good deal of force in the suggestion made, but when you come to apply it is is very difficult, because some of the matters touch tremendous secrets which are being actively examined at this time, and it is not possible to come into consultation with outsiders about them. There are many difficulties of that kind. We are most anxious to examine any suggestions of a reasonable character, and a good many that come from the public can be attended to by the Department to which they are sent or transferred to the proper Department. If there is no particular Department, there is always the Lord President of the Council's general committee of scientific research, and application to him will be attended to.

1945-8-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-8-23;Businesss Of The House;106;The right hon. Gentleman has announced a very long list of Bills for the short Sitting on Friday. I hope he does not suppose that any kind of guarantee can be given that it will be possible to deal with all those topics on a Friday. The Inshore Fishing Industry Bill, for instance, which is not a party Measure at all, like most of the others, will arouse a good deal of interest among people connected with the fishing industry. Perhaps I may be permitted to make it clear that we cannot accept any responsibility for the discharge on Friday of all that quantity of Business.

I can make no statement at present about the future of the Division. I hope, however, that as long as the Commonwealth countries are making a contribution in Korea, a Commonwealth formation will be kept in being. If any proposals are made for constituting standing United Nations defence forces, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested, they will receive careful attention from Her Majesty's Government.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);29;I am obliged to the right hon. and learned Member for drawing attention to what had already been in our minds but now receives more prominence through his exertions.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);14;I do not think there is any difference between us on the general theme.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);10;Yes Sir, I am sure that will be carefully considered.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;29;I am looking forward to seeing the hon. and gallant Gentleman make a gesture of which it can be said that it is at any rate not less hollow.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;31;It is not customary to include the staff of any Department or branch in the salary of the Minister. In this case the Minister does not draw any salary at all.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;32;There is absolutely no relationship between the salaries paid to Ministers and the staffs of the various Departments of State which were so grossly and outrageously increased by the right hon.

1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;23;I think the hon. Member is a judge of cheap demagogic gestures, but they do not often come off when he makes them.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;21;The right hon. Gentleman is no doubt trying to live up to the cheap demagogic gestures mentioned by his hon. Friend.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;18;Without going into all those important topics, I should not wish to alter the substance of my answer.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;57;The items on the agenda for the 14th Session of this Council, which opened on 20th May, again included the world economic situation, the economic development of underdeveloped countries and a report on measures for international economic stability.

1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;13;I do not think in the circumstances that I need read it all.

Friend's proposal, it is not within the power of the Admiralty to delay publication of such information unless there is a security reason for so doing. Even so publication is often made abroad.
1940-2-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-07;Shipping Losses (Publication);53;Yes, Sir. In regard to His Majesty's ships, we do not publish losses until we have informed the relatives, and I should like to see that practice applicable to the Mercantile Marine, but there is nothing like the same control there, and the possibility of publication abroad must always be borne in mind.

1941-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-24;German Invasion Of Russia;244;I do not rise for the purpose of continuing the Debate on the lines to which it has been turned by the Noble Lord, because I am sure that it would not be at all in the public interest to continue on those lines. I rise rather to hope that the other aspects of the difficult foreign situation may engage the attention of the House and that we should not seek to probe and define too clearly the attitude of certain Powers who, surrounded by very great difficulties, may not wish, or may not be in a position, to declare themselves. All this pressing for a precise answer "Yes" or "No" may sometimes lead to getting an answer contrary to the one you expected, and I am bound to say that I hoped this fairly obvious point would have impressed itself even upon the Noble Lord. These excursions of his into foreign politics, which, I must say, he is less well fitted to discuss than some of the other numerous topics on which he assists us, will not, I trust, be too frequent. I find it very difficult to derive any principle of guidance if no reference is to be made to any country in which the Noble Lord has fought. It would be an altogether undue complication of the liberties of our speech. I trust that we shall drop the topic now, because it really is a case of "least said, soonest mended."

1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;His Majesty's Ship "Royal Oak" (Inquiry);26;Yes, Sir; I will make another statement, but I shall have to be very careful not to disclose information which might be useful to other parties.
1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;His Majesty's Ship "Royal Oak" (Inquiry);9;Yes, Sir, I will certainly bear that in mind.
1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;His Majesty's Ship "Royal Oak" (Inquiry);40;Yes, Sir, I have seen a number of statements made by the German U-boat commander. In part they are a repetition of information which I have given to the House, and in part they have no relation to the facts.
1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;His Majesty's Ship "Royal Oak" (Inquiry);34;Yes, Sir, but in relation to Scapa Flow, "harbour" is not quite the right term, because it is a great landlocked bay many miles across.

1950-12-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1950-12-14;Prime Minister's Visit To Usa;151;I think there has been a general desire that with this debate I should give a fuller account of the talks which I had at Washington and supplement the fairly full report that was given in the communiqué. I should like at the outset to recall the circumstances in which I decided to pay a visit to the United States of America. It will be recalled that the House debated foreign affairs on 29th and 30th November, and that just at that time there were grave developments in Korea. I think there was in this country, and, perhaps, not only in this country, a good deal of anxiety as to where events were leading us, and the course of the debate indicated that the present time would be opportune for me to pay a visit to the President of the United States, which I had had in contemplation for some time.

One can always take examples from what happens. The President of the United States the other day let himself be cross-examined freely during a Press conference on this very topic. In my opinion, one ought not to say anything upon the subject one has not very carefully considered beforehand. I certainly do not intend to be cross-examined by the hon. Gentleman, because I have considered carefully what I should say. I am strongly of opinion that the Government should make a fuller statement upon this subject, and that this would be beneficial both to our own position and to our relationship with the United States. After all, this matter has become one of very real and vital consequence to us since the decision of the Government to afford the United States the bomber base in East Anglia, which makes it all the more necessary that the  position in which we stand should be clearly defined.

We wished the right hon. Gentleman well upon his Transatlantic mission, and we have recognised the advantages which it has secured, but I will say now that if he persists in his present attitude on steel nationalisation, he will fail in his duties  to the country as a whole. Although we approved of the visit of the Prime Minister to the United States, although we lent him full support on his mission, although the results have been helpful so far as they go, we cannot in these circumstances feel confidence in the loyalty of the Government to the people of this country. The Prime Minister is counting on our support, which will—[HON.

I am bound to say that it seemed very difficult to understand, but the White Paper which is in the Vote Office will have to be studied with attention and will probably carry the largest measure of proof to those who are best instructed. No doubt we shall have a Debate at a suitable moment on this question. I am not asking for any particular date to be fixed at the present moment. I am bound to say, however, that the two conditions foreseen at the time of the Cripps Mission, which was set up under my Administration—namely, first, agreement between the Indian parties and, secondly, a period of Dominion status in which India or any part of it may freely decide whether or not to remain within the association of the British Commonwealth of Nations—seem to be fulfilled.

1947-6-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-6-03;India (Transfer Of Power);62;As I was saying, the two principles on which the Cripps Mission stood—namely, agreement and a period of Dominion status with perfect freedom to choose—appear to be fulfilled, as far as I can see from the copy of the White Paper which is now in the Vote Office and which, through the courtesy of the Prime Minister, I received an hour ago.
1947-6-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-6-03;India (Transfer Of Power);203;Even in Russia there are distinctions between the grades which different people occupy. If it should prove to be the case that these two conditions have been maintained in fact and in form, then I say that all parties in this House are equally pledged by the offer and the declaration that we have made, and on these points we can only be well assured by the course of events in the next few weeks and months. It is quite true that the agreement of the various parties in India has only been achieved on the basis of partition. I gather that is the foundation. Nevertheless, after a reasonable period of deliberation and responsibility, should all these parties decide to remain within the British Commonwealth of Nations, the theme of the unity of India will be preserved, and the many nations and States of India may find their unity within the mysterious circle of the British Crown, just as the self-governing Dominions have done for so many years after all other links with the Mother Country, save those of sentiment, have been dissolved. It may, therefore, be that through a form of partition, the unity of India may, none the less, be preserved.

With regard to the tribes on the North-East frontier, as the hon. and gallant Gentleman knows so well, they come into the Province of Assam; and that will fall to be dealt with by the Constituent Assembly of which Assam forms a part.

Gentleman explain how it was that the Judge Advocate-General was not consulted and made acquainted with this procedure at an earlier period? The mutiny, or what is called a mutiny, although it seemed a very mild form of mutiny compared with some we have seen in our own time, occurred in May. All June passed. Am I not right in presuming that in June convening orders were given, or the question of bringing these men to trial, either individually or collectively, was discussed? Was not the Judge Advocate-General consulted at that time? What happened in June? What happened in July, when this matter was going on? What happened in August, when these men were still confined under the severe conditions of a tropical land? Why is it only now, when a great storm has been raised in the Press and Parliament, that the Judge Advocate-General is suddenly consulted, and the right hon. Gentleman has to defer to his legal opinion and say that the whole procedure from beginning to end is quashed for the ringleaders as well as the rank and file—all their trials are quashed? How is it that for five long months the Government, with the advice of the Judge Advocate-General always available at their disposal, have permitted this matter to drag itself out to the general suffering of individuals and the impairment of discipline in the Army?
1946-10-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-10-10;Mutiny Charges, Malaya (Convictions Quashed);179;Are we to understand then that the then Secretary of State for War was officially apprised of the fact that action was to be taken against 258 men on a charge of mutiny—a collective trial as it were—and he never had any idea of asking "Is this legal? What precedents are there for this?" Are we to understand that he never asked the Judge Advocate-General, "Is this all right? Is this a legal and proper way of doing it? and that no member of the Government or of the Army Council promoted inquiries of that kind? The right hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that I have had experience of these matters. I unhappily presided over the Army when there was a shoal of mutinies. No one ever attempted to bring large masses of the rank and file to a mass trial. There was the naval mutiny in the days of Ramsay MacDonald's Premiership, and no one thought of bringing great masses to trial. Why was this not settled by the Government and the Cabinet at the time?

I do not mean at this moment, but why should they not be made public? Surely it would be of great advantage to the future to know what are the principles on which we are proceeding. Since when has it been held to be disadvantageous to the cause of justice for the principles on which judicial authorities give their decisions to be made known? If that is not so, how are others to regulate their conduct? Was the question of the mass trial one of the causes of the irregularity?

1952-12-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-16;Nato (Commander-In-Chief, Mediterranean);163;When the right hon. Gentleman announced that the Supreme Command in the Atlantic should go to an American admiral, I thought it a pity, because I thought that we knew most about the reception end, as I have called it. I would have preferred at that time to have had the Supreme Command in the Atlantic for Britain, and would have welcomed the Americans in the Mediterranean, because it was very desirable that they should intervene in force and with a fleet there. However, the right hon. Gentleman had his way. When I went to Washington, it was already settled. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Yes. I had to deal with a matter which had been effectively decided, but arrangements were made then, which I described in the House in as much detail as was possible, which did secure the effective control of the reception end of the Atlantic, and that we have now. That was all as a result of modifications agreed to then.
1952-12-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-16;Nato (Commander-In-Chief, Mediterranean);45;I am aware of that.

1944-3-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-28;War Despatches (Publication);115;This particular publication is one of a series which gives accounts, which I believe are of great interest to the public, of the different campaigns. The passages referring to particular changes of command were not written in any controversial style and do not, in my opinion, in any way alter the answer I gave against publication of despatches in time of war. They do not reflect upon the officers concerned in any manner which would require any further official statement. Of course, if I were pressed to make a further statement, I should be ready to state the reasons why I made certain changes, but I should deprecate it, in the interests of all concerned.

As to this booklet, which was written by the War Office, I had not myself seen it until attention was drawn to it by this Question, but, as I say, it is one of a series of an  informative character. I do not consider that it reflects upon the officers concerned in any manner which would require a special departure from the practice we have adopted.
1944-3-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-28;War Despatches (Publication);50;Certainly; of course they will be published.

We will study it with great attention and endeavour to see what meaning, if any, can be extracted from it. May I ask him whether he would consider, on the first page of his statement, altering the word "merely" —" not merely a military alliance "—to "not only a military alliance," because his statement deals almost entirely with military matters. "Merely" seems, I will not say a disparaging, but an inadequate term to use. As to this new word with which he has dignified our language, but which perhaps was imposed upon him internationally, I can only say that we must have full opportunity to consider it and to consult the dictionary.

1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);142;Could the right hon. Gentleman let us know the character of the invitation or summons that was sent to Seretse Khama? Was there in it any intimation that he might be forbidden to return to the Protectorate for five years? I am glad to hear that, apparently, he is free to return. Is that so? Can he return at any moment? Otherwise, quite apart from the large issues which are raised in this matter, and which I would not attempt to discuss at this time, the question I would ask is whether this chief is being treated quite fairly as between man and man. That is a point which causes some anxiety. To put the point precisely, was he aware beforehand that this decision might be given against him and that he would be the subject of this special regulation and restriction?
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);24;Where would the exclusion order be enforced? Would it be  enforced at the frontiers of the Protectorate or after he had re-entered the Protectorate?

1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);29;Surely he would not be in the same position until he gets back into his territory—in the exact situation he was in when he agreed to come to England.
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);69;Will the Minister give full consideration to the point of honour which is involved? I am not trying to deal with the large questions at all. Will he consider whether it would not be better to allow this man to return to exactly the same position that he was in at the point when the correspondence took place, whatever are the Government's views, rights and authority in the matter?
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);99;May I return to the very simple point in which some of us on this side are interested, namely, the question of whether he was enticed over  here under false pretences or not, and whether he will be restored to his previous position? Where is Mrs. Khama at present, and where was she at the time when Seretse Khama took leave of her? Will the right hon. Gentleman not consider that Seretse has a right to go back to that very place and meet her at that very place before the Government take any further action in the matter?
1950-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-3-08;Tribal Chief, Bechuanaland(Recognition);6;It is a very disreputable transaction.

Gentleman told us just now that it was untrue to suggest that any of these questions raised by my hon. Friends about mixed marriages and so on, and the opinion of white people in South Africa on that subject, had been discussed at all in this matter. Can he give the assurance that none of that was mentioned in the Report?
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;153;I consider that His Majesty's Government were right in not giving out a great deal of information about the flying bombs until we knew more about them and were able to measure their effect. The newspapers have in an admirable manner helped the Government in this, and I express my thanks to them. The time has come, however, when a fuller account is required and a wider field of discussion should be opened, and in my opinion such a discussion is no longer hampered by the general interest. I would at the same time enjoin upon hon. Members and the public outside to watch their step in anything they say, because a thing which might not strike one as being harmful at all might give some information to the enemy which would be of use to him and a detriment to us. Still, a very wide field of discussion will be open henceforth.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;275;Certainly. Children are already being sent at their parents' wish out of the danger areas, which are by no means exclusively confined to the Metropolis. There is, of course, the bomb highway over which the robots all pass before reaching that point of Southern England which I have ventured to particularise this morning. Children are being sent if their parents wish out of the danger areas and, in all cases, mothers with small children, or pregnant women, will be given full facilities by the State. And we do not propose to separate the mother from the child except by her wish, but a terrible thing happened last time. Mothers were separated from children of two or three years of age, and, after a period, when they had saved up money and got time to go down and see them, the children hardly knew them. I hope now with our growing strength, reserves and facilities for removal, we shall be able to say to a mother with three or four children, "If you wish to leave, it is perfectly possible. Arrangement will be made to take you into the country with your children. If you wish them to go by themselves and  you wish to stay here with your husband, or because of your jab, then arrangements can be made that way too." We do not consider that the scale of attack under which we lie at present justifies Governmental compulsion in' any case. In order to speed these arrangements, my Noble Friend the Minister of War Transport, Lord Leathers, has arranged that the railways should provide a larger service of trains from the London stations.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;251;A good many questions can be asked, but the House, I am sure, would wish to have a check-up on them beforehand, because a perfectly innocent and proper question might have some connection which would tell the enemy more than we need tell him. After all, the Germans keep large Intelligence services, always prying about and trying to find out everything they can, and really we ought to leave them something to do. I can see lots of questions that could well be discussed here, and if there were some particular kind of question we wanted to talk over among ourselves such procedure is always available to the House. I am not going to attempt to parade to the House the many difficult questions that have been settled. I have mentioned a good many of them. I could give a complete list, and if I have left  anything out, that is a matter that can be reserved for a future day. We can with confidence leave our civil organisation to do their work under the watchful supervision of the House of Commons. We have had many periods in the war in which the Government have relied on the House of Commons to keep them in close touch with the people and the population affected and from whom we have welcomed helpful suggestions. I think that we can have great confidence in our civil organisation, for they have immense experience and have handled machinery which has stood far greater strains than this.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;191;I would venture to make a suggestion on the spur of the moment. That is, that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Home Security  should depute someone to whom Members could refer, and, if they did not get satisfaction in that way, they could take such other measures as are open. I feel that there will be questions, small questions, but in some cases very painful questions, and I am anxious that the House shall keep in close touch with the Government in this affair, which we are all in together, as in so many others. But it seems to me that it would be a good thing if my right hon. Friend deputed someone 'who was a member of his Committee who could see Members who were anxious about this matter. I did something like this myself 25 years ago during demobilisation after the last war, and it gave great satisfaction. At that time questions amounted to several hundreds a day. If there is any better way of doing it, I will talk it over with my right hon. Friend, and he will make some statement to the House.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;89;It is not for me to answer that question. It belongs to the Leader of the House. On the general question of policy, it is much better that there should be no secret Debate, which would give a sort of idea that I have not been frank with the House. I have been brutally frank. Sometime next week, if my right hon. Friend can find the time for it, it might be very useful to hear both matters which require remedy and ideas which may be put into practice.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;84;I am afraid that I overlooked that in my speech. We always regarded these deep shelters as a reserve, and it has now been decided to make use of them. The Home Secretary is much to be congratulated in having these up his sleeve, and we must make use of them in the manner which is most effective to our general plans, not merely as places where particular individuals can camp out indefinitely, but as part of the general movement and life of London.

1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;23;On the question of deep shelters, I ought to have said that it will take a few days to make the necessary arrangements.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;103;That might easily do something which the hon. Gentleman would be the last to wish. Something might be said which might help the enemy. Every word is read and eagerly scanned in order to try to make up a case. A Debate in public very often consists of criticism, quite naturally, because those who are satisfied remain silent. I am not sure that we need unduly stress the troubles we have to face and mean to conquer, by a public Debate during which at any moment it might be necessary for the Minister to say that we ought to go into Secret Session.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;74;I have said deliberately that that is a subject which raises grave considerations and upon which I do not intend to embark. That, I am sure, is the best way in which to leave it. Might I appeal to the House not to pursue unduly these interrogatories to-day? I weighed my words very carefully, and I would like them to represent what it is we have to put before the House and the people.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;7;No, Sir, it would not be advisable.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;18;That is a matter which might well be considered. I have said that extra trains will be provided.
1944-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-06;Prime Minister's Review;37;That would be a very proper question to put to my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of Health. Might I suggest that it would be a pity for us to make too much of this?

1940-11-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-11-12;Mr Neville Chamberlain;44;Since we last met, the House has suffered a very grievous loss in the death of one of its most distinguished Members and of a statesman and public servant who, during the best part of three memorable years, was first Minister of the Crown.
1940-11-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).txt;1940-11-12;Mr Neville Chamberlain;299;I desire to add a few words on behalf of the Labour party to the eloquent and moving tribute which the Prime Minister has paid to one who was so lately our colleague in the Government, and to one who only six months ago was himself the Prime Minister. It is an old and gracious tradition of this House, when death comes to one who has taken a leading place in Parliament, that controversy should be stilled while leaders of all parties speak in recognition of the loss which has been sustained in common by all Members. At the present time, when war has brought together in support of one Government all the great parties of the State, it might seem, perhaps, unnecessary that anyone should speak from this Bench except the Prime Minister, who can speak for us all. Yet there is, I think, good reason to continue our ancient usages. It is characteristic of the way of life which we are fighting to preserve not to allow political differences to prevent mutual respect and friendship. It is a mark of our democracy to attain national unity, not by uniformity, but by diversity. For all but a few months of his political career, Neville Chamberlain stood for policies in home and foreign affairs to which we of the Labour Party were opposed, and often very bitterly opposed. But this is not the time or the occasion to pass any judgment on those controversies. We are too close to them to gain a true perspective. But opposed as we were to his policy, we never doubted that Mr. Chamberlain was honestly and sincerely following the course which he believed to be right in the interests of his country. We never doubted his deep devotion to the cause of peace.

It was a matter which required careful consideration. One has to have a just sense of proportion in all these matters and, of course, one cannot judge the proportion of the individual except in relation to the background of world affairs, all of which has to be considered in its entirety. The  first 50 years of the 20th century have been among the most terrible that the human race has ever lived through, with two frightful world wars and immense disturbance and destruction of human life. On the other hand, they have contained the greatest promise for the future in the advance of science, knowledge and the broadening assembly of peoples in every way.

We are therefore entirely in favour of these gifts being made from the mother of Parliaments to the daughter States as they were, sister States as they are—I am not quite sure how these family arrangements are conceived of on the other side of the globe —who carry forward so much of our traditions and life and on whom we rely not only to strengthen us in the years to come but to carry our message on to future ages that we shall not perhaps see, in proportionately as powerful a position as we occupy at the present time.

It is obvious that rationing will have to continue for some time after the end of the war. I do not, therefore, consider that my right hon. and gallant Friend's speech raised any new issue.

1941-4-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-4-30;Withdrawal Of Empire Forces;304;As I am most anxious to give the House, the nation and the Empire information at the earliest possible moment, and also in view of the extravagant claims made by the enemy, I think it right now to give the figures, so far as they are known, of the evacuation of the Empire Forces from Greece. Up to the time when evacuation was seen to be inevitable, we had landed about 60,000 men in Greece, including one New Zealand and one Australian division. Of these at least 45,000 have been evacuated, and considering that our Air Force was, through the superiority of the enemy, forced to leave the air-fields from which it could alone effectively cover the retreat of our troops, and that only a  small portion of it could cover the points of embarkation, this must be considered remarkable. The conduct of the troops and especially the rearguards in fighting their way to the sea merits the highest praise. This is the first instance where air bombing, prolonged day after day, has failed to break the discipline and order of the marching columns who, besides being thus assailed from the air, were pursued by no less than three German armoured divisions as well as by the whole strength of the German mechanised forces which could be brought to bear. In the actual fighting, principally on Mount Olympus,. around Grevena and at Thermopylae, about 3,000 casualties, killed and wounded, are reported to have been suffered by our troops. This was a very small part of the losses inflicted on the Germans, who on several occasions, sometimes for two days at a time, were brought to a standstill by forces one-fifth of their number. Nor, of course, does it take any account of German losses incurred in their assaults on the Greek and Yugoslav Armies.

Gentlemen opposite must not be drawn into exaggerated hopes. They are no longer, as we stood in the days of the Lloyd George Budget, at the first frontier of a large and fertile territory. The entire area has been swept through, harvested and gleaned, and gleaned again and again, and we stand on the far side of what is now a thoroughly scrubbed field. It is an astonishing fact—which my right hon. Friend the late Chancellor has mentioned to me—that, if you took all the incomes in this country above £2,000, every penny of it, if you took the whole of that into  the Exchequer, keeping the existing rates of Income Tax and Surtax going, the profit to the Exchequer would be £60,000,000, and that figure of £60,000,000 has to be considered in relation—that is a remarkable statement—to a Budget which has at present to be balanced in March next in the neighbourhood of £5,400,000,000. It has to be balanced at that rate. It must also be judged in relation to schemes of social betterment and reform which run into not £60,000,000 or £600,000,000, but, in many cases, into thousands of millions of expenditure in the long run. Therefore, the great glee which is manifested is rather of a shallow nature and those who feel it running through their veins should prepare themselves for the fact that that is probably the only satisfaction which they will get out of the business.

It would be a very great omission on my part if I did not take this opportunity to return most humble, dutiful and grateful thanks for the announcement which has been made that compulsory insurance premiums against further damage by enemy bombs, are not going to be collected. It gives one confidence to feel that one lives in a land where there is so much broadminded tolerance shown by the executive Government. But I thought it was rather hot when my right hon.

The Permanent Commission of the Brussels Treaty have not yet completed their examination of detailed plans. When they have done so a Governmental Conference will have to be convened at which it is hoped that other European countries besides the Brussels Treaty Powers will assist in the framing of a constitution for the Council of Europe.

In view of the present military position that objection no longer holds. I read in the newspapers that there is an impression in some quarters in the United States that our stocks in Great Britain amount to 700,000,000 tons. Actually they are now rather less than 6,000,000 tons. They are in process of being reduced, by aid to the liberated countries, to about 4,750,000 tons by the end of June. This latter figure is no more than is necessary to maintain a regular flow of distribution under present conditions. I thought it was worth while mentioning these facts about our stocks of food, which have been built up by foresight and self-denial over five years of strict rationing and frequent bombardment.

I was not aware, and up to this moment I am not aware, that if a disorderly act occurs in any part of the House in Committee, even though the Chairman is on his feet, a Member may not rise to a point of order. Of course, if the Chairman does not give way, the hon. Gentleman must resume his seat; but that does not say he is not entitled to draw the attention of the Chair to a gross and shameful act of disorder like booing. I thought I was quite entitled to rise.

However, various other Departments are also closely involved. All this proceeds under my responsibility as Minister of Defence. In February, 1941, I formed the Battle of the Atlantic Committee and instituted meetings under my personal direction, in order to focus and emphasise the need for supreme exertions and to make sure that there was proper concert between all authorities. Meetings were held at first weekly, and later at longer intervals. Eighteen were held in 1941 and 1942. As the House knows, a very great alleviation of our losses occurred up till December, 1941, and I was satisfied during 1942 that the organisation was running with complete smoothness and efficiency.

Member that I rarely like to be at any considerable distance from a piece of wood. But there is a difference in making predictions and in stating facts about the past, and facts which are known at the moment. So far as the future is concerned, I always speak with the greatest caution, but when you are making a statement of what the facts are at this moment, after six months of the war, on this occasion to the House, I think it is right to say what the state of affairs really is, because it is said that even Heaven itself cannot control the past. Therefore, I say that apart from the "Royal Oak" and the "Courageous," no other large ships have been damaged or sunk since the outbreak of war or during these very difficult winter months. I say difficult months, because not only  have our ships had constantly to keep the sea in sufficient strength amid the storms of a tempestuous winter, amid icy blizzards and high-running seas, but since the "Royal Oak" was sunk we have not had the use of Scapa Flow, which is, of course, our best strategic base, and which would save our ships from a great deal of unnecessary steaming through dangerous waters. "Under the adverse circumstances," if I may quote a hero's phrase, our ships, great and small, have been at sea more continually than was ever done or dreamed of in any previous war since the introduction of steam.

The measure is the number of men available in the various yards, private and public, and the need for increasing that number of men is very great indeed. Warship building must have priority up to a certain point, but we have equally to replace our merchant tonnage. It does seem to me that at the present time the supply of labour is not adequate to the effort we should like to make in both these fields.

Gentleman has not done that at all, and I shall put to the House the words he has inserted which show how far from accuracy that muttered interjection lies. Little as we like the 1945 Act, or subscribe to its principles in time of peace, I doubt if it would have encountered any serious opposition if the Bill had merely been for the removal of doubt as to whether that Act was still in force now.
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;297;Hon. Gentlemen opposite cheer that, but applied in its full force that would be the complete abrogation of Parliament and of all our dearly-bought and long-cherished liberties and rights. It is not only Governments that have rights—ordinary British people have them too. No reason has been given us by the Lord President, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, to justify the casting away, by us, undefended, of such rights as are still free from the operation of the 1945 Act. Who is to be the judge, I should like to know, of whether the conditions of Clause 1 (1, c), those sweeping words which excite the enthusiasm of hon. Members opposite, are in fact fulfilled by any legislation demanded by the Government? It is only Ministers who are to be the judge. The courts have ruled that the Minister who takes executive action has only to declare that he considers that action necessary under the Act, and that is the end of the matter. That is, at any rate, the practice which is growing up. There is no protection at all to be looked for in that quarter. Therefore, the only guarantee we would have that Clause 1 (1, c), would not be abused is in the character of Ministers and the confidence we place in them. Thus we are asked to give a blank cheque for totalitarian government, for that is what this is, at the absolute discretion of Ministers who, proceeding by Orders in Council when Parliament is not sitting, and may not be sitting for months, would be absolute masters. Is this really necessary to the life and recovery of the country? I should have thought that it would have spread so much uneasiness and alarm as to discourage and paralyse effort.

1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;15;So I did. I have been so much interrupted. But I have got another one: 
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;10;The right hon and learned Gentleman went on to say: 
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;127;Hon. Members opposite seem to be very hilarious, but there is an air of apprehension behind their laughter, because they know that they will have to justify on every platform in the country not only the physical miseries which they have inflicted upon this country, but the gross invasions of our fundamental liberties. I ask, are these powers in Subsection (1, c), in their vague, all-embracing terms, the kind of powers which we would entrust to a man who holds these views about this House, and about society and the State in relation to ordinary men and women? Naturally, one shrinks from giving support to such immense powers when we have heard beforehand how one of the most able of all the Ministers intends to use them.
1947-8-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-08;Supplies And Services (Transitional Powers) Bill;261;Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will be successful in catching your eye, Mr. Speaker. He is not successful in catching mine. I am still mystified about the intentions and motives of the Government. The Prime Minister's speech on Wednesday is universally judged to be inadequate to the crisis and vague in its character. Are the Government trying to make up for lack of deeds by boastful words? That is a point which has occurred to me. It is the most innocent explanation of this Bill that I can find. Why should they come forward with all these demands for totalitarian powers when nothing that was said by the Prime Minister or by any of the Ministers who spoke yesterday in the Debate furnishes any substantial reason for their need? Is it because—and we must ask ourselves this—they wish to get Parliament separated and away on the holidays and then use these powers with irrevocable effect? Or is it, having no  effective plan or design, they wish to cover up their vacuity by the assumption of sweeping powers? Some light must be cast on this as the Debate proceeds. If the Government are sincerely concerned with the enduring validity of the 1945 legislation, and wish only to be reassured on that point, it is quite easy for them to accept the series of Amendments which we shall place on the Order Paper to that effect. If what they tell us is their purpose is true, it is quite easy for them greatly to diminish any criticism or opposition to this Measure.

We have urged the great inconvenience to which the public was subjected, and I should like to ask how it  was that these arrangements, which I must say seem to have been very carefully considered, could not have been thought out before striking the blow which caused immense disturbance and heavy internal loss to this country. Why should not all the thought, or a good part of the thought, contained in this statement have been expended in the Government Departments concerned, and the nation have had the benefit of a well-considered, carefully-considered scheme instead of the abrupt and crude cut?

Would it not be better to say that this scheme will have at least a year's run?

Experience before, during and since the last war has shown conclusively that the main Civil Defence work is so closely linked with the maintenance of law and order and the work of local authorities that the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland must be the focal points for preparations and for operational control in the event of war. There has, of course, to be close liaison between the fighting Services and  those engaged in Civil Defence, but this can be effectively secured, in our opinion, by consultations between Ministers and the services concerned.

Of course, undoubtedly, what is needed to make a very keen voluntary effort in Civil Defence is a sense of alarm, of danger. Without that it is difficult, and as the feeling that, perhaps, things are a little better and the outlook a little clearer grows in the land, it has that disadvantage that people do not feel the same need to be prepared for immediate war.

What the right hon.

When people say that they would rather commit suicide or would resist forcibly being sent back to the Communist zone, due consideration must be given to their wishes. Terrible things happened after the end of the Second World War about the repatriation of Russian prisoners. But, after all, we had been the ally of Russia, and many of these Russian prisoners had fought against their own country when it was in dire struggle. Moreover, the shape of the world was not defined as we can see it now.

We could easily replace their division with one of ours in Europe." There are many Americans who think that China is more important than Europe. It certainly would be a great misfortune if that line of thought were to prevail. Indeed, it might easily lead to the ruin of the whole European structure of defence which is being built up with so much effort and sacrifice and would expose us all to mortal danger not only of war but of destruction.

Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague), but the hon. Member concluded his speech by repeating the request for an independent inquiry into the work of the military side of the Royal Air Force, and it is for the purpose of dealing with that point, and that alone, that I have risen. The hon. Member based his request on what he represented to be virtually the demand of the Cadman Committee. I must say that I find nothing in the report of the Cadman Committee which justifies any statement such as that. One casual observation in a single paragraph out of the 124 paragraphs in the report was taken by the hon. Member, and he put on it a weight which was evidently far greater than it was in itself intended to bear. If, indeed, it had been in the mind of the Committee that an inquiry of this kind, or of the kind described by the hon. Member, were necessary in the public interest, they would certainly not have dismissed it in that brief sentence, but would have supported that demand by an adequate buttressing of evidence.

While, as I said, at any time I should find it very difficult to accede to this request, which in fact amounts to instituting a court-martial upon the Air Ministry, I put it to hon. Members that they could not find a more inopportune moment than the present to institute an investigation which must distract the attention and occupy the minds of those who are engaged, not only in administration, but also in the production of our programmes. This is not the time to harry them to answer questions which do not sound to me as though they were based on any very competent authority. Let us all put our efforts together, get on with the job, and supply this country with the Air Force which it requires in the shortest possible time.

The passage which he has quoted deals with civil aviation and civil aviation alone, and the censure of which he speaks, of neglect of responsibility, is in relation to civil aviation. That is specifically mentioned.

Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague) has quoted is paragraph 26. I am speaking of paragraph 23. I say that the censure upon the Secretary of State had reference to civil aviation and that the answer to that censure is that it is true that this matter was neglected, but the reason is clear and obvious to everybody, namely, that the Secretary of State was obliged to give his whole attention to the question of military aviation until that, at any rate, had been put on its feet.

1938-10-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-10-05;Policy Of His Majesty's Government;290;If I do not begin this afternoon by paying the usual, and indeed almost invariable, tributes to the Prime Minister for his handling of this crisis, it is certainly not from any lack of personal regard. We have always, over a great many years, had very pleasant relations, and I have deeply understood from per-  sonal experiences of my own in a similar crisis the stress and strain he has had to bear; but I am sure it is much better to say exactly what we think about public affairs, and this is certainly not the time when it is worth anyone's while to court political popularity. We had a shining example of firmness of character from the late First Lord of the Admiralty two days ago. He showed that firmness of character which is utterly unmoved by currents of opinion, however swift and violent they may be. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hull (Mr. Law), to whose compulsive speech the House listened on Monday—which I had not the good fortune to hear, but which I read, and which I am assured by all who heard it revived the memory of his famous father, so cherished in this House, and made us feel that his gifts did not die with him—was quite right in reminding us that the Prime Minister has himself throughout his conduct of these matters shown a robust indifference to cheers or boos and to the alternations of criticism and applause. If that be so, such qualities and elevation of mind should make it possible for the most severe expressions of honest opinion to be interchanged in this House without rupturing personal relations, and for all points of view to receive the fullest possible expression.

The utmost my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has been able to secure by all his immense exertions, by all the great efforts and mobilisation which took place in this country, and by all the anguish and strain through which we have passed in this country, the utmost he has been  able to gain—[HON. MEMBERS: "Is peace."] I thought I might be allowed to make that point in its due place, and I propose to deal with it. The utmost he has been able to gain for Czechoslovakia and in the matters which were in dispute has been that the German dictator, instead of snatching his victuals from the table, has been content to have them served to him course by course.
1938-10-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-10-05;Policy Of His Majesty's Government;173;She must very recently have been receiving her finishing course in manners. What will be the position, I want to know, of France and England this year and the year afterwards? What will be the position of that Western front of which we are in full authority the guarantors? The German army at the present time is more numerous than that of France, though not nearly so matured or perfected. Next year it will grow much larger, and its maturity will be more complete. Relieved from all anxiety in the East, and having secured resources which will greatly diminish, if not entirely remove, the deterrent of a naval blockade, the rulers of Nazi Germany will have a free choice open to them in what direction they will turn their eyes. If the Nazi dictator should choose to look westward, as he may, bitterly will France and England regret the loss of that fine army of ancient Bohemia which was estimated last week to require not fewer than 30 German divisions for its destruction.

Friend the figures which he desires. Now I think I have concluded what I wished to say. I wish to commend this Bill to the House as opening a new chapter in the relations between Eire and ourselves. The members of my family have more than once in the past made an effort to improve those relations, and if I feel some confidence that the prospects of a settlement this time are more hopeful than they were before, it is because the conditions which accompanied our negotiations were themselves far more favourable than we have ever had the good fortune to meet on previous occasions. These discussions have been carried through in a spirit of accommodation and good will. I would like to pay my tribute to Mr. de Valera and his colleagues for the way in which they played their part in these discussions. We could not always agree with them, but we always felt that we had' before us men of sincerity who were genuinely anxious to meet us and to come to terms with us if they could.  In spite of all the controversies of the past and all the heat that has been generated, this country and Eire cannot do without one another. Our natural interests and our geographical position inevitably tend to bring us together, and what has kept us apart has been, not a divergence of interests, but something which ought to be far less important, and that is a difference of opinion. Somebody sent me the other day a passage from John Selden's "Table Talk," written some 300 years ago, which perhaps the House will allow me to read, because, although it is quaintly expressed, it seems to have a bearing upon this subject. He writes: 
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;28;I will give a categorical denial now. I notice that Mr. de Valera also denied it in his speech to the Dail to which I have already referred.

1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;241;I could not reconcile it with my duty to the House, as a signatory to the Treaty, the broken Treaty, if I kept silent upon this Bill. However thankless the task may be, I feel bound to record the view which I have formed as the result of long and intimate contacts with Irish affairs. When I read this Agreement in the newspapers a week ago I was filled with surprise. On the face of it, it seemed to have given everything away and received nothing in return, except the payment of £10,000,000. Then I supposed there was another side to the Agreement, and that we were to be granted some facilities and rights in Southern Ireland in time of war. That, I notice, was the view taken by a part of the Press, but soon Mr. de Valera in the Dail made it clear that he was under no obligations of any kind and, as the Prime Minister confirmed this afternoon, there were no reservations on either side attached to this Agreement. On the contrary, Mr. de Valera has not even abandoned his claim for the incorporation of Ulster in the independent Republic that he has established. Indeed he said—I am not quoting his actual words—in his speech in the Dail that the ending of Partition will remain the main purpose of his life, and he believed that it would ultimately be found to be brought nearer by this Agreement.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;98;His Majesty's Government, supported by the Conservative party and the Opposition party have now accepted Mr. de Valera's claim practically without challenge, except for the fact that they are not prepared to put pressure upon Ulster to make her leave the United Kingdom. No doubt they would defend Ulster with all their strength if she were violently attacked. All the rest of the contentions of Mr. de Valera are by this Agreement, it seems to me—I hope I may be corrected on the legal view—tacitly or directly accepted. I think that is a fair statement of the position.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;252;Naturally, he did. I am sure he would. I admire very much the immediate manner in which he welcomed the great concessions which have been made to his country; but, as I say, I only wish that if they were to be made, they had been made to those who kept faith with us. None the less, the fact remains that in Irish history Mr. Cosgrave, his party and his friends will always be considered to have taken a poorer view of Ireland's chances than Mr. de Valera, and Mr. de Valera to have been the one who gained them the great advantages they got. That is a hard burden to impose in history upon men who faithfully adhere to solemnly-contracted treaties. Mr. de Valera has given no undertaking, except to fight against partition as the  main object of his life. But behind and beneath him there are other forces in Ireland. The dark forces in Ireland renew themselves from year to year. When some are conciliated, other present themselves. They are very powerful in Ireland now. No one has ever been brought to justice in Ireland since the Treaty for murdering an Englishman. There is a whole organisation of secret men bound together on the old principle that England's danger is Ireland's opportunity. Even Mr. de Valera, while gaining these astonishing triumphs over what these persons regard as their hereditary foe, is only with difficulty holding these forces in check and in suspense. Let him proclaim a friendly policy towards England—
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;337;—and you will find that they will immediately grow in force and become the party in the ascendant. Let him ask these people to expose Ireland to the great tribulations of war for the sake of England, and see what they will do. It seems to me that you cannot exclude this possibility of neutrality as being one which may well come within the immediate sphere of our experience. Therefore, I say that the ports may be denied to us in the hour of need and we may be hampered in the gravest manner in protecting the British population from privation, and even starvation. Who would wish to put his head in such a noose? Is there any other country in the modern world where such a step would even have been contemplated? Let me say this—and I hope it will not give offence—can anyone remember any other House of Commons where such proposals would have gone through in this easy manner? No doubt hon. Members will speak about the Dominions. No doubt I shall be told about South Africa, Canada and Australia. The case of Ireland is not comparable with the Dominions. Southern Ireland is not a Dominion; it has never accepted that position. It is a State based upon a Treaty, which Treaty has been completely demolished. Southern Ireland, therefore, becomes a State which is an undefined and unclassified anomaly. No one knows what its juridical and international rights and status are. The Dominions are far away. We could guarantee their immunity from attack  with our Fleet. The Dominions are loyal. Great as would be their loss, still I cannot feel that it would necessarily be fatal to us if, during the course of a war, there was a declaration of neutrality by one or other of the Dominions. But here the danger is at our very door. Without the use of these Treaty ports, even if their use were also withheld from an enemy, we should find the greatest difficulty in conducting our supply.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;30;We shall be fighting, if we ever should have that great calamity  thrust upon us, upon the basis and within the ambit of the Covenant of the League of Nations.
1938-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-05;Eire (Confirmation Of Agree Ments) Bill;293;I never said anything against the Covenant of the League of Nations. I have no doubt hon. Members opposite would like very much to make that an issue between the two parties, but I hope and trust they will not succeed in that respect. When we are proceeding, as we should be in such unhappy circumstances, upon the basis of law and equity, how could we justify ourselves if we began by violating the neutrality of what the world will regard, and what we are teaching the world to regard, as the Independent Irish Republic? At the moment when the good will of the United States in matters of blockade and supply might be of the highest possible consequence, you might be forced to take violent action against all law and accepted usage, or alternatively you might be forced to sacrifice Ulster, or, in the third place, do without the use of these almost vitally important strategic ports. What is it all being done for? What are the new facts which have led to this sudden departure? To me, it is incomprehensible. To the world, to all the hungry aggressive nations, it will be taken as another sign that Britain has only to be pressed and worried long enough, and hard enough, for her to give way. If that is so, by that very fact you will bring the possibility of war nearer and you will lessen your resources for dealing with that danger. You are inviting demands from every quarter. You are casting away real and important means of security and survival for vain shadows and for ease. I have felt it my bounden duty to place these warnings and counsels, which I offer in all sincerity, before the House this afternoon.

I am not in any way prepared to deal in detail with the very difficult, delicate and also immense questions connected with the function of women in the immediate post-war world. I imagine that many will seek release to retire to their homes. The arrival of the demobilised Army men will make great changes. I remember being much worried about this when I was Minister of Munitions at the end of the last war, when I had, I think, over 1,250,000 women under the direct control of that office. It all worked out quite all right for the actual moment; when men came back, the women, in many cases, gave up their jobs. My misfortunes did not begin until a year after that.

I take no responsibility at this stage for the accident, but the fact that it has occurred is patent. How it can be remedied is also patent. If my hon.

It is, however, well recognised that at Commonwealth meetings we do not intervene in matters which are primarily the concern of one individual country. Nevertheless, it is not possible to argue that South-West Africa is simply a matter of domestic concern to the Union Government. This Government and their predecessors have accepted an advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice formally recognising that the United Nations have a direct and legitimate concern in the destiny of this former mandated territory. I do not think I want to say anything more upon the subject, and I do not commit myself at all in any way to any discussions which may or may not be raised.

1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;212;This long Debate has now reached its final stage. What a remarkable example it has been of the unbridled freedom of our Parliamentary institutions in time of war. Everything that could be thought of or raked up has been used to weaken confidence in the Government, has been used to prove that the Ministers are incompetent and to weaken their confidence in themselves, to make the Army distrust the backing it is getting from the civil power, to make the workmen lose condence in the weapons they are striving so hard to make, to represent the Government as a set of nonentities over whom the Prime Minister towers, and then to undermine him in his own heart and, if possible, before the eyes of the nation. All this poured out by cables and radio to all parts of the world, to the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our foes. I am in favour of this freedom, which no other country would use, or dare to use, in times of mortal peril such as those through which we are passing. But the story must not end there, and I make now my appeal to the House of Commons to make sure that it does not end there.
1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;81;I was only citing the facts as they are known to me; I have not been concerned to make a detailed attack upon the right hon. Gentleman's administration of the War Office. I am explaining that we had, at the time after Dunkirk, to concentrate upon numbers. We had to make thousands of armoured vehicles with which our troops could beat the enemy off the beaches when they landed and fight them in the lanes and fields of Kent or Norfolk.
1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;185;At the present moment I have not got there. At the present moment I am only dealing with the Matildas, Cruisers and Valentines, which I may say belong to the Belisha group. Nevertheless, I was about to say that in spite of the fact that there was this undoubted delay through no preliminary work having been carried as far as it should have been, it would be wrong in my opinion to write off as useless the Matilda, the Cruiser and the Valentine  tanks. They have rendered great services, and they are to-day of real value. In Russia the Valentine is highly rated. Has the House any idea of the number of tanks we have sent to Russia? As I said, we have sent 4,500 altogether to the Nile Valley. We have sent over 2,000 tanks to Russia, and the Russians are using them against the German armour, with vigour and effect. Therefore, I am not prepared to say that it is right to dismiss these weapons—although their appearance was retarded by the circumstances which I have mentioned—as not effective and powerful weapons of war.
1942-7-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-02;Central Direction Of The War;225;In what way does that affect the argument I am holding, namely, that if we had made dive bombers instead of 8-gun fighter aircraft, we might not have had the 8-gun fighter aircraft to shoot down the JU.87's when they came over? I remember well, 40 years ago, rising to interrupt the late Mr. Balfour, and, after I had said what I had to say, he rebuked me by saying, "I thought my hon. Friend rose to correct me on some point of fact, but it appears that he only wishes to continue the argument." Now there is no doubt whatever that the Army desire to have dive bombers, and, nearly two years ago orders were placed for them. They have not come to hand in any number yet. That is a detailed story which I certainly do not wish to press, if it should be thought in any way that we were throwing any blame off our shoulders onto those of the United States. On the point of priority, the case is clear, when  you have, as you had then in the United States, an immense market, an immense productive sphere and no priority questions had arisen. The rate at which the product was evolved was not influenced by the priority position. It was influenced by various incidents—changes of design and so forth—which occurred.

Work of this type has already been done informally, but it is hoped in future to make it much more widely available.

The landing of the troops on a broad front, both British and American—Allied troops, I will not give lists of all the different nationalities they represent or the States they represent—but the landings along the whole front have been effective, and our troops have penetrated, in some cases, several miles inland.

1947-10-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-23;Royal Navy (Strength);84;What is the actual strength of the Home Fleet at the present time? Is it true, as was stated in an announcement by the B.B.C. before the week-end, and consequently repeated to the Press of the world, that the Home Fleet consists of only one cruiser and four destroyers at the present time? That is the first question I would venture to ask. The right hon. Gentleman, as a result of the statement he has made, has thrown very little light on the position.
1947-10-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-23;Royal Navy (Strength);58;On what authority was this statement made by the B.B.C.? On whose authority was it stated that the Home Fleet would be reduced to what is called a "striking force" of one cruiser and four battle destroyers—not battleships? On whose authority was this statement, so likely to be injurious to our interests all over the world, put up?
1947-10-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-23;Royal Navy (Strength);183;I should like to ask the Minister of Defence why this unauthorised report was not in the first place immediately corrected, because great harm was done to our interests all over the world by the idea that we had only one cruiser and four destroyers maintained in our Home Fleet. I should also like to ask how it is, if this is to be the case for the time being, with over 170,000 men at present, and working on the basis of 140,000 men on Vote A right up to the end of the next financial year, which appears in the statement the right hon. Gentleman has just made, and with an expenditure of £180 million, or something like that, he is not able to maintain in commission a proper squadron of ships, with battleships and so forth, during this period? Is the failure of the Government to do that not a proof  of the gross mismanagement and incompetence which has characterised the control of the Fighting Forces since the war, and, I am sorry to say, afflicted the right hon. Gentleman's administration.

1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;213;I think that everybody in this House realises the gravity of the position, and there is no denying that there is widespread anxiety in the country with regard to our air defences and to the methods pursued by the Ministry. I think that that anxiety would have been lessened if the Noble Lord had met the matter a little more frankly, with some confession of past failures. He was too uniformly loyal. Loyalty is an admirable characteristic, and it is one of the Noble Lord's most outstanding characteristics; but he carried his loyalty to such a pitch that he was really quite unconvincing. This is not a question that is raised by just a few partisans; it is not raised by just a few disgruntled or interested persons. I was sorry that the Noble Lord laid so much stress on that. He seemed to think that the whole of this criticism, or a very large part of it, came from this or that firm, and that we were being led away in our criticism by interested persons. It did not seem to occur to him that many of us have a great volume of evidence on these matters, and that not one of us would take the mere word of an interested person.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;64;I doubt whether those Members are so misapprehensive. I have found them right before. This is a matter of grave public concern, and everyone is in a difficulty in dealing with it on the Floor of the House. We do not know how much possible enemies may know.

1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;175;We have a production of something like 250 a month. Look at the comparison of the Great War. I am aware that aeroplanes are now more complicated. I am also aware that in the Great War there was a terrific strain to find people to produce the necessary munitions for the Navy, Army and Air Force. Yet in the War we started with little experience and had only 113 aeroplanes, and we worked up to an output of 1,229 a month, and in four years to 2,668 a month. We built over 55,000 aeroplanes during the War. That was a terrific expansion. Why has so little been done in the last three years? There must be something wrong when the results are so puny. In the War we had a very slight start. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping talked about the seed time, but in that seed time there was the sowing of wild oats. Until you get the organisation of munitions supply you will not really begin to overtake these difficulties.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;215;I am very glad to hear that, but we shall know better when we get delivery of the planes. My information is that the organisation is bad and that the workers are complaining of time being wasted, not of money being wasted. I should like to ask a good many questions with regard to instruments. There is the question of blind flying. I am not in the least satisfied with the statement we have had about blind flying. We have had the definite statement that blind flying apparatus was not being fitted to obsolete machines, only to new ones, but as only a comparatively small proportion of the squadrons have been provided with new planes, and these only recently, it follows that very few pilots have had any experience in blind flying. I can-  not understand why it should take these years to advocate these instruments. One of the complaints that has come to me is that although these things are being used in other countries, the authorities in this country took a long time to adopt them. I am told by an experienced officer that the fact is you may say that our Air Force is a fair weather force. Until quite recently it has not done any blind flying. That is extremely unsatisfactory.
1938-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-12;Air Ministry;54;The hon. and gallant Member knows perfectly well that there are votes which are delivered for a particular purpose and do not necessarily carry any meaning.

In these circumstances, I would ask the indulgence of the House not to press me to try to say anything until we have further and fuller information.

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;187;We have an uncertain shake of the head from the Minister. The assurances have been given all over the country, and repeated everywhere, that this is the maximum scale of cuts that is to be imposed—those contained in the Schedule to this Order. Where do we stand? I was very much struck with that uncertain lateral movement of the Minister's head. Does the right hon. Gentleman know where he is? [HON. MEMBERS:" Yes."] Then, rejoicing in that happy position, let him tell us where we are. Where do we stand on this question of future reductions of the present bread ration scale? Why be afraid to tell the British public the truth? If we have to take it, we can take it, but a Government that is afraid to tell people what they are going to be up against, will  not get the confidence of those people enduring the hardships. I am glad to see the hon. Lady the Member for West Fulham (Dr. Edith Summerskill) taking her place and hope that she has completely recovered from the distressing accident about which we were all much concerned.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;137;Why it should be kept a secret till then, I do not know I only asked the right hon. Gentleman whether he was going to keep his word or not, but if he likes to reserve himself on that point, very well. We contrast the smallness of the saving with the immense amount of hardship, and we are left wondering what is the reason for this violent act, unless there is to be a big increase in the cut. On the statements which have been made to us, the need is not apparent, and if the need be proved, the remedy appears wholly in-  effective. It is like using a steamhammer to crack a nut when there is nothing in the nut. That is the impression we have so far derived from all we have been told.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;233;The right hon. Gentleman has said so. I am very glad of  that. I rejoice at that. Never will I have any emotion but joy and relief at anything which helps our country. If there had been a great breakdown, or something terrible going to break out upon us now, some skeleton in the right hon. Gentleman's cupboard going to leap out, I would still have counselled him to let it out at once, and not be frightened about it. But as I understand that he will give an answer which is reassuring on this point, namely, that the pipeline will not tall below 800,000 tons before 31st August, I can only tell him that, so far as I am able to obtain any information on the subject, that was the answer I expected him to give. If that is so, where is the case for imposing this rationing scheme on 21st July? If it is said that there is a great saving, that is an argument. If one says that some terrible thing is about to happen and that we must have the scheme now, that is an argument. If it is said that we are putting it into operation and will have to make it more severe in the future, that is an argument. But all these arguments arc demolished. What then is the argument for bread rationing on 21st July?
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Bread (Rationing) Order;61;Before the right hon.

But this is surely a matter to cheer the hon. Member whose pacifist tendencies are so well known. We are now at peace, and we are about to celebrate its joys—
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;235;I accept with pleasure the hon. Gentleman's statement that he prefers peace to war, and that his preference is remarkably pronounced and manifested on a great many occasions. But peacetime is what we are supposed to be  dwelling in now, and I submit that all the precedents of peacetime oblige a Minister to make a statement when he retires from office. I cannot, in my long experience, remember many cases to the contrary. If we look back before the war there were three most recent cases. There was the resignation of my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden)—that will cheer up Members opposite; they clutch at straws—in 1937, accompanied by that of Lord Cranborne, a member of the Government, both of whose explanations were received in a most grave and attentive spirit by the House. Then there was the resignation of Mr. Duff Cooper, now Ambassador in Paris, after the Munich crisis. Again, a very full and moving explanation was given to the House. This is the first case, in peacetime, of the resignation of a Cabinet Minister, and I say that those are precedents which should be followed. Not only should they be followed on this occasion, but they should be followed in the future. I thought it my duty to give full notice to the ex-Minister of Food, and I wrote to him this letter two days ago: 
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;282;The failure of the wheat supply of the world is not due to a shortage in any one particular country. It is due to a shortage in particular countries, but it is not due to any general failure of the world crop. That is a very essential point. The conditions in the British zone in Germany should have been foreseen beforehand. The story is indeed a tragic one. At the end of the Potsdam Conference, the Russians and Poles were allowed to occupy up to the Western Neisse, and not the Eastern Neisse, and another great influx of hungry and homeless people, numbered by millions, was driven into the British zone. The British zone is the least favourably circumstanced from a food point of view. There is the least agriculture and the most manufacture. There you have the great population of the ruined Ruhr. We have a more difficult task in our zone even than, the United States in theirs. The great feeding grounds which nourished Germany as a whole lie to the East of the iron curtain, and food supplies have not been sent from there to the population of Germany as a whole, to whom they belong, and which should have been reserved for their nourishment. On top of this has come this incursion of a very large additional number of hungry, suffering people. This had all been foreseen, because it arose out of decisions which were reached at Potsdam. I am not making this a matter of serious complaint; personally, I would not have agreed to it, although I might not have been able to prevent the establishment of the Western Neisse as the frontier between Poland and Germany.
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;22;The right" hon. Gentleman should do me the justice of noting that I personally declared that he was ill-used in the matter.

1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;45;Is that true about bread? I thought that was quite exceptional, because it is the poorest people who eat most bread. They have less choice of diet and, therefore, the rationing of bread, like a bread tax, hits the poorest people much harder than others.
1946-5-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-31;World Food Situation;103;I would like to congratulate the hon. Gentleman upon the eloquence with which he moved us during the latter part of his speech, and although I think his views of the outlook were exaggerated, it is certainly better for a Minister to begin in a difficult office of this character in a spirit of facing, and even magnifying, difficulties, rather than in a lighthearted spirit, expressing hopes which may not afterwards be fulfilled. I always find, myself, that the British nation will never forgive optimism that is not borne out, but that if pessimism is not borne out one's previous inaccuracies are forgiven.

1941-7-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-7-09;Minister Of State (Duties, Middle East);169;The principal tasks of the Minister of State will be, first, to facilitate the conduct of operations by the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East by relieving them, so far as possible, of a number of extraneous responsibilities with which they have hitherto been burdened, and, secondly, to settle promptly matters within the policy of His Majesty's Government but which involve several home departments or local authorities. The appointment of the Minister of State will not interfere with  the existing relationships between the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East and the Service Ministers, or between His Majesty's Ambassador, Cairo, and other representatives of His Majesty's Government in the Middle East, and the Ministers in this country to whom they are responsible. The Minister of State will make reference home whenever necessary on important issues of policy; but it is to be hoped that the presence of a War Cabinet Minister with wide discretionary powers will smooth, hasten, and concert action in the Middle East between the various authorities in that area.

His business is to serve the Commander-in-Chief with the largest possible measure of supplies in accordance with the wishes of the Commander-in-Chief and the needs of the Army, and also in accordance with the practical business of handling the great mass of supplies arriving from this country and the United States, and the Minister of State will have the benefit of the advice of Sir Robert Haining in anything which may touch this part of his duty. I would say that the kind of relations which I hope to see between the Minister of State and the Intendant-General on the one hand, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army on the other, are very largely the sort of relations  which prevail in the matter of supplies between the War Office and the Ministry of Supply in this country and General Sir Alan Brooke, commanding the Army in the United Kingdom.

Because an hon. Member is raising a point of order, that does not entitle him, in the course of putting his point of order, to use disorderly and insulting expressions.

Gentleman has abruptly refused the suggestion of my right hon. Friend. I should have thought that in this morning light he ought to be feeling very uncomfortable. I do not mean physically but morally and mentally. When we look back at what has happened, and the long time that has been required by the Committee to discuss these Clauses, we can see how monstrously unfair was the proposal he made, which he tried through the usual channels to get us to adopt, that we should have finished Clause 31 by 12.15 last night.

Gentleman had. But I return to the direct point of whether our affairs will be advantaged by causing the Committee to continue to sit. I must give the Home Secretary a warning. Revenge is a dangerous and costly motive. The idea of saying, "You did not let us finish up at a quarter to midnight, therefore we will give you a bigger dose than any you administered to us," shows that the right hon. Gentlemen on the Government Front Bench are allowing themselves to become a prey to degraded emotions.

1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;95;There is little to add to yesterday's statement. The task of dealing with perishable foods is duly proceeding to the requirements of the Ministry of Food. Work is also proceeding on the part of some of the workers at Surrey, Blackfriars, West India and Tooley Street Docks and efforts are being made to obtain a fuller resumption of work. It is clear that the continued strike is the only bar to an examination of any grievances that may be felt. I would ask that I should not be pressed for any further statement this afternoon.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;52;Troops are being used in accordance with the demands of the Ministry of Food. Other Armed Forces will be brought in if necessary. The necessity is not very great at the present time, because, although there were certain perishable foodstuffs, the Armed Forces were there, and the men did the work yesterday.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;57;It is obvious that one cannot, at a moment's notice, replace the whole number of men at the docks, but all preparations are made, if the stoppage should continue, for bringing in more men from the Services. At the present moment, those who are there are put in to meet the requirements of the Ministry of Food.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;20;We are not waiting. There are some 7,000 men now at work, and I hope to see a further resumption.

1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;63;No, Sir. I have already said that it is perfectly open to raise that question of disciplinary action, but the particular cases have been dealt with under the machinery that has been set up. The full resources have been brought in, and the question has gone to appeal, not once but twice. It is quite impossible to suggest that it should be re-opened.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;90;Could the right hon. Gentleman, who has asked us not to press the matter now, state what is the nature of the impending or current negotiations which are going forward which requires him to say that this matter ought not to be discussed now? We have had this same reason given day after day, but the strike has continued, and I think some more precise and substantial reason should be given to us if we are not to press for this matter to be further considered at the present time.
1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;40;There are, of course, no negotiations with the unofficial strikers.

If there are 150 ships accumulating and awaiting discharge, why, after all this, should not the full strength of what are called Service personnel be used to unload these ships and procure the clearance of the port and a cessation of the paralysis which grips it at present? Some sort of reason ought to be given us, though we do not want to have an awkward discussion which would embarrass the Government. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman in refusing to give way to the demands made against the legitimate trade union, but we really ought to have something more solid than has been given to us so far.

1948-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-6-24;London Docks Strike;7;I think I made that statement yesterday.

I never suggested that the steps taken should be limited to the movement of perishable foods. That was the first matter that had to be dealt with.

A standing committee has been set up to advise the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland on questions affecting the industry as a whole in time of war, and in particular the maintenance and distribution of supplies. It has been possible to return a number of requisitioned vessels to the industry as they have been relieved by other vessels. The question of purchasing and building further trawlers for the industry is being actively pursued.

The House should, I think, take formal cognisance of the liberation of Rome by the Allied Armies under the Command of General Alexander, with General Clark of the United States Service and General Oliver Leese in command of the Fifth and Eighth Armies respectively. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] This is a memorable and glorious event, which rewards the intense fighting of the last five months in Italy. The original landing, made on 22nd January at Anzio, has, in the end, borne good fruit. In the first place, Hitler was induced to send to the south of Rome eight or nine divisions which he may well have need of elsewhere. Secondly, these divisions were repulsed, and their teeth broken, by the successful resistance of the Anzio bridgehead forces in the important battle which took place in the middle of February. The losses on both sides were heavy—the Allies losing about 20,000 men, and the Germans about 25,000 men. Thereafter, the Anzio bridgehead was considered by the enemy to be impregnable.

Member: "They were not cogent."] I have a higher opinion of the Prime Minister's constitutional propriety in making those remarks than his follower has. I think he was extremely just in the statement he made, in which he said it would be quite wrong to ignore the rights of the electors, but here we have this alteration in our procedure made not for some overriding circumstance arising out of the needs of the State but for party convenience, and for the convenience of a party whose authority rests on an election ten years ago won on a policy which was betrayed, and won by a party which had to be superseded by an all-party Government headed by the man it rejected.
1940-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-5-28;War Situation;239;The House will be aware that the King of the Belgians yesterday sent a plenipotentiary to the German Command asking for a suspension of arms on the Belgian front. The British and French Governments instructed their generals immediately to dissociate themselves from this procedure and to persevere in the operations in which they are now engaged. However, the German Command has agreed to the Belgian proposals and the Belgian Army ceased to resist the enemy's will at four o'clock this morning. I have no intention of suggesting to the House that we should attempt at this moment to pass judgment upon the action of the King of the Belgians in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Army. This Army has fought very bravely and has both suffered and inflicted heavy losses. The Belgian Government has dissociated itself from the action of the King and declaring itself to be the only legal Government of Belgium, has formally announced its resolve to continue the war at the side of the Allies who have come to the aid of Belgium at her urgent appeal. Whatever our feelings may be upon the facts so far as they are known to us, we must remember that the sense of brotherhood between the many peoples who have fallen into the power of the aggressor and those who still confront him will play its part in better days than those through which we are passing.

I must say that in Alan Moorehead—who I understand was at one time publicity officer to the Ministry of Defence—one could hardly have had a more trustworthy author.

1941-10-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-14;War Situation (Russia);16;The hon. Member should not suppose that he has a monopoly of anxieties in these times.
1941-10-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-14;War Situation (Russia);44;I do not at the present time see any reason at all for an early Debate. I think it might be detrimental to have a discussion on the situation there. I am sure that it would be likely to do more harm than good.
1941-10-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-14;War Situation (Russia);38;Of course, in all these matters the House is master. The Government is only master of what it says. But I should deprecate a discussion on this subject at the present time, either in public or in secret.
1941-10-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-14;War Situation (Russia);21;I am sorry that the hon. Member should go out of his way to abuse our Ambassador in the United States—
1941-10-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-14;War Situation (Russia);14;The hon. Member spoke of him as an irresponsible person with a bad record.
1941-10-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-14;War Situation (Russia);18;Well, I call that abuse, and abuse of a man who has a high mission outside this country.

1943-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-11-09;War News;9;No, Sir. I do not think this is necessary.
1943-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-11-09;War News;69;We have arrived at a stage in the war where there are very large free Presses on both sides of the Atlantic which are fed on very full and vivid information from all the theatres of war. It is quite possible that some temporary discordance may from time to time make itself manifest, but I am not aware that there is any great evil here to be grappled with.
1943-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-11-09;War News;42;I do not quite see what that has to do with the Question on the Paper, but Hitler still has some other allies besides the one mentioned by my hon. and gallant Friend, on which no doubt he relies a great deal.

However, we will do our best.
1952-3-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-3-03;Royal Commission On Taxation (Chairmanship);6;I must have notice of that.
1943-10-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-10-12;Colonies (Self-Government);90;I have ascertained that no verbatim record was made of what my right hon. and gallant Friend the Secretary of State for the Colonies said at Lagos on 12th September. My right hon. and gallant Friend with whom we have communicated suggests that the Question may refer to a remark, which was in effect what he had already said in this House on 13th July, namely that there could be no reality in self-government without the ability to be financially independent. As a general statement this seems to be unexceptionable.
1943-10-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-12;Colonies (Self-Government);26;Well, and we have the advantage of knowing direct from the Secretary of State for the Colonies what is the position in principle which he adopts.
1943-4-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-07;Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Bill;222;I am not aware that the practice of legislating by reference is increasing. It is impossible to draft a Bill amending existing legislation without referring to that legislation. The Bill referred to by the hon. Member sets up a new Board on whom it is proposed to confer, subject to certain necessary modifications, the powers under existing legislation of authorised undertakers and of the Central Electricity Board. As the hon. Member is aware, the Bill as introduced proposed that the necessary modifications of the existing legislation should be made by Order in Council; and it was in deference to views expressed by hon. Members that amendments were put down by the Government to make the necessary modifications by the Bill itself. It is necessary to apply no less than 13 separate enactments comprising 299 Sections and 13 Schedules.  To have set out in a Schedule the whole of these enactments with the proposed modifications would have resulted in the production of a Bill which, by its mere bulk, would be more difficult for Members to understand than the Bill in its present form with the amendments proposed. As regards the last part of the Question, the draftsmen of Government Bills have constantly in mind the proposals made in 1938 and all other available methods of making amending legislation as lucid as possible.
1943-4-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-4-07;Hydro-Electric Development (Scotland) Bill;5;I have covered that point.

1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;20;I beg to move, to leave out from "civilization" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof: 
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;65;No, I had no right or authority to propose a three-Power meeting any more than we have today. I was proposing a two-Power meeting, an informal meeting between me and my right hon. Friend on the one hand and Mr. Malenkov and Mr. Molotov, on the other hand, or anyone else they chose to bring, at some neutral place where we could talk over things.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;86;I was not cross. I voted for the unanimous Resolution which mentioned a three-Power conference, but I do not think that now is a good opportunity to stress that point when these critical discussions are going on in France. I carefully stated, if I remember rightly, that I was sure no offence was meant—but it would be tactless to do it now, and that is one of the reasons why I prefer our Amendment to the Motion of censure. That is what I am arguing about.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;86;I think I have trespassed too much on the great kindness and indulgence of the House to allow me to go so far back over the past. I think that if I were to try to explain the motives which animated me every time I have been called upon to address a public meeting in this country, I should be going really too far and would lose at once the patience of the House and that general attitude of indulgence which I have received from it.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;33;Why is it impracticable now, although it does not seem to have been thought impracticable when the Prime Minister first proposed it, and when Western European defence had not been organised at all?
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;61;The hon. Gentleman was making the point, not that it had not been proposed, but that it had not been ratified. The hon. Member made the point that to propose talks now would be a sign of great weakness. A fortiori, it would have been equally weak if Western European defence had not been conceived and was not there at all.
1955-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1955-3-14;World Disarmament;59;The hon. Member is making heavy weather of this. I naturally paidsome tribute to the efforts which the Foreign Secretary has made, though that does not mean to say that I necessarily approve the whole of the foreign policy of the Government. I think that  they have been tardy in this matter and that involves the Foreign Secretary collectively.

1949-9-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-9-29;Ussr And Yugoslavia;21;I am afraid that I did not listen to the one o'clock Broadcast, and I have not heard of any statements.
1949-9-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-29;Ussr And Yugoslavia;47;I did not listen either but I am informed that it was stated that there was reason to believe that the Soviet Government had delivered an ultimatum to Yugoslavia. Have the Government any statement to make? It is not right that such rumours should go long uncontradicted.

1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Atomic Energy (Discussions With United States And Canada);80;:I wish to ask the Prime Minister a further Question of which I have given him Private Notice. This is on quite a different topic which should give no cause for heat of any kind, except the most intense heat of which the universe is capable. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make regarding his discussions with the President of the United States on the problems arising from the discovery of atomic energy?
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-10-30;Atomic Energy (Discussions With United States And Canada);75;Yes, Sir. I am visiting President Truman shortly in Washington in order to discuss with him and the Prime Minister of Canada the problems to which the discovery of atomic energy has given rise. I have invited the right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Scottish Universities (Sir J. Anderson), who is Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, to accompany me in an advisory capacity, and he has been good enough to accept.
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Atomic Energy (Discussions With United States And Canada);83;I am sure the House will wish the Prime Minister all possible success in his mission. I hope it will take place under those easy and informal conditions which have characterised other relationships between the head of the British Government and the President of the United States, and I trust it will not be limited to any particular topic and that conversation will range freely over everything that can conduce to the closer amity, intimacy and understanding between the two great English-speaking countries.
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-10-30;Atomic Energy (Discussions With United States And Canada);4;That is another question.

1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Atomic Energy (Discussions With United States And Canada);70;I hope the Prime Minister will not prejudge the question of a Debate on foreign affairs before he goes. Hithertowe have not pressed the matter, but I think it may be necessary for us to ask him to consider the matter before he leaves this country, as various views should be set forth, so that they will be published to the world. Naturally, the House will exercise the utmost discretion.
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-10-30;Atomic Energy (Discussions With United States And Canada);11;I think it is better to take these things by stages.

1949-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-5-12;North Atlantic Treaty;89;I did not expect that such a condemnation of the Soviet Government's policy would be forthcoming from the hon. Gentleman. For all these reasons, it is most certainly true that the occasion is not entirely unmingled with joy, for the country sees so many who have changed their courses, but I say that we are now asked to approve this Atlantic Pact, and the only opposition to it is expected from that small band of Communists, crypto-Communists and fellow-travellers whose dimensions have been very accurately ascertained in recent times.

1949-5-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-5-12;North Atlantic Treaty;65;I should not like to live under the present Spanish regime, but I would rather live there than under the Governments of the various countries I have just mentioned, and I imagine that would be the opinion of almost every Member of this House who is not either blinded by fanaticism or sure he would get most favoured treatment in the circumstances which might arise.

1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-07;Cost Of Living;70;I really think this ought to be put quite plainly, because we see in the papers that questions have been raised as to whether Marshall Aid should be continued now, and a statement like that coming from the Home Secretary at this moment may conceivably lead to decisions which I was not aware, from anything we have been told, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is either expecting or welcoming.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-07;Cost Of Living;39;The right hon.

1950-11-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-22;Military Equipment (Export);95;Is not the question of the immediate stoppage of the delivery of Centurion tanks and other modern war materials to Egypt a definite matter of urgent public importance? Might I, as a matter of order, ask you, Sir, whether any reference to moving the Adjournment made by one of my hon. Friends below the Gangway does not refer to the Adjournment of the House? It is quite a different thing from the special procedure, so long cherished by the House, of moving the Adjournment of the Debate on a definite matter of urgent public importance.
1950-11-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-22;Military Equipment (Export);59;We are not seeking to move the Adjournment upon any intricacy as to the questions asked, or how they were answered, but on the definite matter of urgent public importance of continuing the exports of vital war material at this juncture from this country, which may be going on any day—a definite and urgent matter of the highest importance.

What I meant to say, and what I think I said, was that "it may be going on any day." Anyhow, that is what is meant.

1950-11-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-22;Military Equipment (Export);39;We give notice that as you, Mr. Speaker, have refused our request for an Adjournment debate on a definite matter of urgent public importance, we shall seek the earliest convenient opportunity to debate this precise issue in the House.
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Haslar Hospital (Accidental Deaths);90;I am aware of the very regrettable accident to which my hon. Friend refers. The fullest investigation is being made into all the circumstances, but in the meantime immediate steps are being taken to prevent the recurrence of such a case. For the purpose of payment of pension these men's deaths will be regarded as attributable to Naval service. The question of further compensation will be considered when the inquiries have been completed. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my sympathy with the relatives of the deceased.
1943-3-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-17;French Coastal Areas (Bombing);158;As I stated in this House on 11th February, the task of overcoming the U-boats has been given first priority in all the British and American plans. The destruction of U-boat bases is an essential part of this strategy. Very heavy blows have already been delivered by the R.A.F. and the United States Army Air Corps against the U-boat bases, both in Germany and in occupied France. We have repeatedly urged the French population to leave coastal areas. A large part of the civil population of Brest and Lorient have in fact been evacuated, and the Germans have attempted to conceal the severity of the raids from the German crews expected to use Lorient. The qualities of resistance displayed by the French people day by day are well known, and I have no doubt that they will understand that operations such as the bombing of Lorient will bring victory nearer and thus hasten the day of France's deliverance.

There is now four years' very intensive and specialised training. Is that being thrown over, and are we coming down to two and a half years? I may have misunderstood the hon.

I proposed that he should receive a salary equal to that of the Controller of the Navy, but he has wished to give his services without remuneration. He has also resigned his position upon the Board of National Shipbuilders' Security, Limited, and has obtained leave of absence, with two exceptions, from the boards of all other companies of which he is either chairman or director.

1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);138;His Majesty's Government are as concerned as anyone else with the security of the communications of the British Commonwealth and Empire, with the security of the Canal, and with the best possible relations with Egypt and the continuance of our alliance with that country; and it is precisely for that reason that we are making the approach that we are making. Let me record briefly a little bit more of the history of our relations with the Egyptian people. They have sometimes been good; sometimes not so good. I can recall the course of those relations over  a good many years in this House. I remember very well the efforts that were made to try and get an agreement when Mr. Arthur Henderson was Foreign Secretary, and that nearly succeeded in 1929. A difficult period followed after that.
1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);9;I thought the right hon. Gentleman made that treaty.

Gentleman was referring to a later treaty; I thought it was the 1921–22 Treaty. But I should say that even those ports would have been of little use to us if, as a matter of fact, it had led to strong hostility among the people of the country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] That is, I believe, the fact. We are proposing this, first of all, because in the preliminary exchanges of views which have taken place between the British and Egyptian negotiators, and on the basis of the advice which we have received from all those who are in a position to give us advice, or very well qualified by long knowledge of Egypt—all the advice given to us has convinced us that in order that the alliance should continue with the same mutual confidence and success as in the past, it is essential to take as the departure the complete freedom and independence of Egypt.

1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);137;Yes, certainly. What we are endeavouring to work out with the Egyptians is how we can best get those facilities; how, and in what time, it will be possible to withdraw our troops and get rid of the very large installations that we have there; and how, with them, we can arrange to carry out our obligations for the defence of the Canal. I entirely agree with what the right hon. Gentleman has said about our responsibility in this matter, and we are trying to arrange the best possible way of fulfilling our responsibilities. That can only be done with the hearty good will of the Egyptian people, and in this matter the period of the withdrawal of our Forces will be a matter to be worked out by experts. It depends on physical and administrative factors.
1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);55;Yes, I brought this draft before the Dominion Prime Ministers and discussed it with them. [HON. MEMBERS: "Did they agree?"] Well, I did not come to this House to—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]—His Majesty's Government take full responsibility.

1946-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-5-07;Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations (British Forces, Withdrawal);206;Yes, I see. Then the negotiations are for the purpose of securing a satisfactory defence of the Canal zone in a manner most agreeable to Egyptian sentiment. If they break down, then we revert to the 1936 Treaty. That is a very important admission, and I am bound to say it relieves my anxiety to some extent, but it in no way improves the view which we take of the method by which the Government intend to handle this matter. They begin by saying, "We will withdraw the troops." They go on to say, "If the Canal zone is not properly defended, we revert to the 1936 Treaty with the troops on the Canal zone." But who has ever suggested that there is any method of safeguarding the Canal except by troops in the Canal zone? You will not get any military man of eminence and responsibility to say that the Canal can be kept open—because that is the whole point; it is to keep the Canal open. Anyone can close the Canal from hundreds of miles away; it is to keep it open that we require  troops on the spot, not only when danger has come but in the months before the storm has burst.

He says there was an agreement about the universities, because he was of the opinion that the university Members in the last Parliament were non-party, but that, since the election, because two Conservatives have been elected, he considers there has been a breach of that agreement. He wants, therefore, to abolish the representation of the universities. [Interruption.] Surely, that is the position which he has taken up? Is not this an attempt to affront, and even intimidate, the free voting in very large constituencies of men who have had the advantage of graduating at a university, and can this be the basis of such a change?

Like him, we knew Masaryk over here during the dark years of the war, and very often my right hon. Friend and I saw him and were able to appreciate the working of that competent mind and resolute, unflinching soul. We mourn his loss—it is a heavy loss—but one cannot help rejoicing, as the right hon. Gentleman has done, that the famous name he bore will continue to be an inspiration to the peoples of Czechoslovakia.

1937-7-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-20;London Naval Treaty Bill;258;I too join with the right hon. Gentleman in offering my congratulations to my right hon. Friend upon his appointment to one of the four or five great key offices of the State, and to express to him—I have known him for so many years—not only my good wishes for his success, but my confidence that his abilities will be found of distinguished service to the country in his new office. The matter which we have to discuss tonight has been thrust upon us at rather short notice. It is quite true that we are familiar with the 1935 Treaty, but the important Russian and German papers, which are very bulky and very technical, were only in the Vote Office at seven o'clock last night, and it is rather severe that Members whose duty it is to follow and take an interest in these matters should not have a little longer notice of the fact. However, as the Session is drawing to its close some of this telescoping probably is necessary, but these are very large and complex matters, and it is much better that publication of matters of interest to the British Government should be in the Vote Office at least a week, if it is possible, before the House is asked to adopt them. But I bring that forward in no captious spirit, because on the whole I have very little to say against this arrangement, as we now see it, and, having regard to all that has gone before, something to say in its favour.
1937-7-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-20;London Naval Treaty Bill;242;I am talking about the new programme. Suppose they solve the problem in a satisfactory manner, as they may do, then we must be ready to make a change. Do not let us be told that we are to lose another three years because we have not made our preparations. That is the point upon which I want to make an appeal. Will the First Lord now make sure that he begins the preparations for all the alterations to gun plant which will be required in the event of an advance to the 16-inch gun being considered necessary, and will he have constructed an experimental 16-inch gun mounting in order that everything may be  in readiness? Then, it we find that other countries have solved this problem, which we have not, and we are forced to go forward with the higher guns, there will be no further delay. I make a strong appeal that this preliminary work should be set in train at once. In this matter, as in others, you can see how naval agreements and treaties hamper and cripple British initiative. It is true that if other people take steps which we hoped they would not take we have freedom to take fresh steps, but we have always waited for a year or two and then when an advance has been made upon us in cruisers and battleships by other countries invoke the escalator clause and take the next step.
1947-5-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-5-06;Clause 1—(Liability To Be Called Up For Service);288;As to the ethics of war and the ethics of society, we are all in favour of the ethics of society. The reason why this Bill was brought forward is that we were so worried lest the ethics of society should be upset by the ethics of war. I must return to the question, and the Committee must consider it, of how much greater sacrifice it would impose on citizens to begin this strain at 21 and run on to 28, than to begin it at 18, when it is part, almost, of the educational system. There can be no comparison of the two. From the point of view of the social application of this compulsory service, I certainly do not wish to fasten on to the hon. Gentleman, who made his  speech from the highest possible motives, any desire to cast a slur upon the Army; but things change as time goes on. The Army is a very different business now from what it was in the days when a red coat was not allowed inside a public house, and was treated as the scum of the population, until a war broke out, and he had to go and fight, and then he was a hero. It is very different now. A national Army is quite different from an Army of volunteers, who were produced largely by the pressure in the economic market. I am all for volunteers who come from some uplifting of the human soul, some spirit arising in the human breast, but to create a modern Army on a voluntary basis, by the mere pressure of the economic system, is entirely contrary to the kind of world on which our outlook is now fastened.
1942-3-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-3-19;Minister Of State In The Middle East (Mr Casey's Appointment);148;I thought it would be to the convenience of the House if I made this announcement at this moment. His Majesty has been pleased to approve the appointment of the right honourable Richard Gardiner Casey, D.S.O., M.C., to be Minister of State. Mr. Casey will be a member of the War Cabinet of the United Kingdom, and will represent the War Cabinet in the Middle East, where he will concert, on their behalf, the measures necessary for the prosecution of the war in that area, other than the conduct of operations. Mr. Casey will be described as Minister of State in the Middle East. Mr. Casey is at present Australian Minister in Washington; and I wish, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, to express our thanks to the Commonwealth Government for their consent to release Mr. Casey at this juncture from his important duties in the United States.
1942-3-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-19;Minister Of State In The Middle East (Mr Casey's Appointment);48;Naturally, I would not be precise, for security reasons; but he has to wind up certain affairs in the United States with representatives of the Commonwealth who have arrived there, and after that he will naturally consult with us as to the British aspects of his new duties.
1942-3-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-19;Minister Of State In The Middle East (Mr Casey's Appointment);49;I am not able to answer that last point; but, as far as this House is concerned, a Member of the War Cabinet will answer for him. Mr. Casey will be a member of the United Kingdom War Cabinet for all purposes, although his duties lie outside this country.
1942-3-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-19;Minister Of State In The Middle East (Mr Casey's Appointment);43;Neither of those solutions would be impossible; but, as a matter of fact, there are precedents in time of war for Ministers who are His Majesty's subjects from the Empire holding office in this country without being Members of either House of Parliament.
1942-3-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-19;Minister Of State In The Middle East (Mr Casey's Appointment);60;Yes, Sir; certainly he will have the same powers. As to the rest of the Question, I do not think it necessary at the moment. I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about the pleasure with which this announcement will be received throughout the British Empire, and I see no reason why he should not share in it himself.

Members will doubtless have seen the announcement of the names in the Press  today. They are: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Inverchapel, Sir Edward Bridges, Professor Wade and Mr. T. H. Gill.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);71;Did the right hon. Gentleman, in coming to this decision, take into consideration the fact that the formation of this Committee arose out of The Hague Conference—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—yes, out of The Hague Conference, and that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster did his utmost to prevent or spoil that Conference and was everywhere regarded as a protagonist against the policy of a united Europe except upon a Socialist basis?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);82;I think the right hon. Gentleman is incorrect in two respects. The question of closer unity in Western Europe has been considered, not only by The Hague Conference, but by the Governments concerned, and very practical steps have been taken by this Government in that direction. Secondly, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had certain views with regard to The Hague Conference, but he was always strong in his support of the idea of Western European collaboration.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);30;Is it not a fact that in his speeches the right hon. Gentleman has said that Western European unity is conditional on its being founded upon a Socialist Party basis?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);11;I do not understand that that is the fact at all.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);64;Will the right hon. Gentleman be so good as to read the statements made by the colleague whom he has specially picked out for this task, and see whether he has any right whatever to suggest that the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has not done his very utmost to prevent European unity except on a Socialist Party basis?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);7;I disagree with the right hon. Gentleman.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);95;I think King Henry IV of Navarre was the first. There is one of these names which the Prime Minister read out about which I should like to ask him particularly, and that is the name of Sir Edward Bridges. Is it not rather a serious thing, and rather unfair to the distinguished gentleman in question, to involve the Permanent Head of the Civil Service of this country in controversy and partisan politics and in foreign politics, and did this not produce unfortunate results in the Civil Service in the case of Sir Horace Wilson?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);95;The right hon. Gentleman himself has suggested this danger with regard to the position of Sir Edward Bridges. It is really quite normal for Governments to employ civil servants when they have Government representatives going to a conference. I have never heard it suggested previously that, in the case of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden), if he was attending an international conference and took a civil servant with him, that therefore that civil servant was considered to be a Conservative. It is the right hon. Gentleman's own prejudice.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);43;Is not the right hon. Gentleman overlooking and slurring over the difference between civil servants engaged in Departments who only attend their Ministers, if necessary, in the course of Departmental duties, and involving the Permanent Head of the Civil Service in controversial politics?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);50;the phrase "controversial politics" comes entirely from the right hon. Gentleman. It is one of the right hon. Gentleman's curious prejudices that, if there happens to be a Labour Government, that is partisan, but, if there is a Conservative Government or a Government headed by himself, it is not partisan.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);119;When the right hon. Gentleman accuses me of partisanship, does he realise that all the other Governments under the Brussels Treaty and Agreement have sent all-party delegations, in which the most eminent statesmen and former Prime Ministers of those countries have been involved, and that the French, in particular, have sent M. Leon Blum, M. Herriot and other very prominent representatives; and that,  in consequence, in choosing a representation of officials acting under instructions, he is putting himself and his party out of step, very much against the views of many of them, with the general movement to build up European unity, and is it not unfair to involve Sir Edward Bridges in a partisan transaction of that character?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);98;I have tried to explain to the right hon. Gentleman, in reply to the letter he was good enough to send me, that in the case of France there is a Government composed of many parties. It is not surprising, therefore, that they have representatives of those parties—[An HON. MEMBER: "And outside."] I also pointed out to him, and hon. Members will note this, that four of these members are not Members of Parliament or representatives of the Government directly. It must also be pointed out that there are no representatives of the Chief Opposition parties in France.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);8;Does the right hon. Gentleman mean the Communists?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);40;Yes, and General de Gaulle. The chief Opposition parties are not represented; therefore, the right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong in thinking that this is an all-party delegation; it is a delegation representative largely of the Governmental parties in France.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);34;This will have to be a matter of Debate at an early date, and I would ask my right hon. Friend when he deals with Business, to open this matter with the Lord President.

1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);38;My hon. Friend is, of course, quite correct, and he realises that the work to be done here deals with practical questions. Therefore, we do not necessarily want to include a large number of orators from different parties.
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);51;May I venture to ask the Prime Minister if he will be so charitable, in virtue of the confession of submission which he has heard, as to extend his forgiveness to the hon. Member for North-West Hull (Mr. R. Mackay) for having defied the Socialist caucus in going to The Hague?
1948-11-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-18;European Unity Committee (British Representatives);55;I thought that was perfectly obvious. If the right hon. Gentleman has read, and I am sure he has, the terms of the communiqué, he will see that the remit to this committee is a wide one, to consider all kinds of methods. There is no suggestion that it is tied down to one party.

1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);68;As I explained yesterday, I understand that the reference to a plot was not to the putting forward of the Schuman scheme. I quite agree that a full report was given, but I understand it was made clear at the time—it is always a difficult thing to do in a  speech—that that particular sentence applied only to Parliamentary proceedings and not to the question of the Schuman Plan.
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);22;Are we to understand that in this matter the right hon. Gentleman derived his information from the Secretary of State for War?
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);11;I have, naturally, consulted my right hon. Friend on the matter.
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);63;How can the right hon. Gentleman explain the fact that the Secretary of State for War had handed out, both from the War Office and, I understand, locally, a textual report, which is confirmed by the Press Association, who took it down, in which the passage referring to the plot, as actually delivered by the Secretary of State for War, was as follows: 
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);0;
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);51;On what grounds can the Prime Minister dissociate the word"plot" from"these schemes" and the Schuman scheme, which was the one before us? May I earnestly hope that we shall have better treatment from the Prime Minister, on a matter of this very important personal kind, than we have received so far?
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);65;I have already explained this matter. I naturally did not answer on the spur of the moment. I naturally asked my right hon. Friend about the speech, and he made it perfectly plain to me that at this point in his speech he turned to the question of Parliamentary proceedings, and that the word"plot" referred to the activities of right hon. and hon. Members opposite.
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);7;What did the right hon. Gentleman say?
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);18;I said that the word"plot" referred to the proceedings in this House, and not to the Schuman Plan.

Gentleman, contrary to the text, that the word"plot" did not refer to the Schuman scheme, cannot in any way be possibly sustained?
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);24;My right hon. Friend was referring to the fact that there was a proposal to hand over these industries to an irresponsible authority and—

1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);52;I am answering the hon. and learned Member for Hove (Mr. Marlowe). I think that it is a perfectly fair comment, on looking at the scheme, to say that one would be putting into the hands of an irresponsible authority powers to deal on a very wide basis with all these industries.
1950-6-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-06;Schuman Plan (Minister's Speech);47;is not the essential point whether the word"plot" covered the Schuman proposal? What other proposals were there before the public at the time, except the Schuman proposal we had just been debating? Surely the right hon.

1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);58;Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that in the statement he has just made, he has made a considerable, albeit only a partial, advance towards the policy which we on this side of the House declared at the General Election? On 29th November we stated, in the "Unionist Policy for the Effective Control in Scotland of Scottish Affairs": 
1950-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-25;Scotland (Financial And Economic Committee);110;That was 29th November; that date is quite easy to take in. Will not the right hon. Gentleman consider whether, while he is deferring to our wishes to a certain extent, he will not go the whole way and, instead of appointing what he calls a strong and independent Committee, appoint a Royal Commission, which is what we have demanded? Perhaps he has received some legal advice. At any rate, will he say whether he will appoint a Royal Commission and then we should be able, on this side of the House, to congratulate ourselves on having at any rate secured this measure of consideration for a vital Scottish matter?

Gentleman that part of my anxiety in this matter is due to my desire that the reputation which he acquired in a subordinate position at the  Foreign Office shall not be squandered now that he is the head of a Department.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;252;The Foreign Secretary in his closing sentences expressed a desire for a unity of attitude in this country on foreign affairs, but the speech which he has just delivered has widened the gulf which existed between this party and the party opposite. I have heard a number of speeches by the right hon. Gentleman, but I have never heard such a cynical pronouncement as that which he has just made. In his earlier speeches in this House he used to uphold the ideal of the League of Nations and the ideal of the rule of law. He seemed to have some idea that there should be at least a distinction between right and wrong in foreign affairs. Throughout this speech he has emphasised all the time that the only thing which affects His Majesty's Government is the interests of British Imperialism. He has emphasised that it  is the only thing on which a risk should be taken. By doing so, he has illustrated very clearly the entire difference in outlook between the Government and the Members of this party. I want to develop that point a little later, and I shall show how, in every sphere of foreign politics on which he has touched, that prime difference comes out that this party stands for the rule of law and for the development of a commonwealth of nations, and that the Government are back in pre-war days, considering only, and narrowly, what they consider—I believe quite falsely—to be the interests of this country.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;282;I am very glad to have that assurance. I sent a message to the right hon. Gentleman which I hope reached him, asking him to deal with this subject in his speech. I hope that this will be done for the women and children, despite any opposition from General Franco, because the slaughter of women and children is not a legitimate act of war. In the same way, there is the question of the surrender of troops, and whether they can be taken to be unarmed in order to save their lives. If there were a land frontier, the troops could reach it and be interned, as happened in Holland in the later days of the War but in this case they are faced with the sea. The fact is that there is a danger that the whole of these brave men may he slaughtered because it happens to be a sea front and not a land front. Here, again, I believe it is of the utmost importance that our Government, in conjunction with other Governments, should do the utmost to save these people, not only because of the people themselves, but to prevent the exacerbation of the whole civil war position in Spain. A civil war is a horrible one at any time, but if an atrocity of this kind takes place it might lead to other  atrocities. I am sure the Valencia Government will do all they can to stop it, but they will have this terrible exacerbation of strife, and I do ask that our Government should show as much resolution when they are dealing with a question of humanity as they would for the interests of British shipping.

I do not think he has realised the strength of the national feeling in Spain any more than he realised the strength of the national feeling in India, and I do not think he realises yet the national feeling in China. But I think we ought to recognise here and now that you can have no possible  judgment between the combatants in Spain until there has been a complete withdrawal of foreign troops.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;196;I think the place to make statements is in this House. I made the same speech twice in Trafalgar Square as I made here. I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the attitude of the United States is of the very first importance, and the fact that they are going to meet with us in this Nine-Power Conference is of vital importance. I believe this adventure of Japan's is only undertaken because of the attitude of this and other Governments in always letting the aggressors get away with it. I believe there is great opposition in Japan. Japan's financial position is extremely weak and Japan's economic position is extremely weak. If one tithe of the consideration which is shown about British shipping in the Mediterranean was shown about the Japanese invasion of China, I believe this invasion would stop. This is a deliberate piece of aggression by one Power against another, and all through the Government wash their hands of the matter. Either they say "it is a matter in which we cannot take sides" or else, as was hinted in a speech by the Foreign Secretary, "we are too weak to do anything."
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;214;That is just the weakness of the right hon. Gentleman. He always believes any kind of propaganda that is put out against us. Japan also says that she is out for peace. Does he believe that? I do not believe for a moment that Japan would challenge the world. The world has given its verdict at Geneva. A verdict like that, followed by no action, is perfectly useless. The Prime Minister has said that the question involved is the sanctity of treaties, but the Government has torn up a number of treaties. So far from this Government having brought this country into safety and security, I believe it has jeopardised our security, and the right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong when he believes there is any kind of unity behind this Government. There will be no unity behind this Government so long as it pursues a policy which is entirely divorced from the realities of the situation, entirely divorced from any idea of collective security and the rule of law, and is directed only by a short-sighted view of Imperial interests. We can assure him that he will meet with opposition from this side so long as he and his Government pursue the kind of policy they have pursued over the last five years.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;304;The House always listens with pleasure to a speech from the hon. Member who has just addressed us, because he is always good tempered and always convinces us that he is speaking with complete sincerity. But good temper and sincerity are not sufficient to make an accurate analysis of the complicated foreign situation or to formulate a policy. If the hon. Member will forgive me, I should like to say that he is in the position in which the Leader of the Opposition accused the Government of being, namely, that he seems to me to be completely divorced from reality. He is a victim of phrases and words. He uses words over and over again without, it seems to me, making clear what he means by those words. He says that the Government have no policy, that he can never understand their foreign policy. What does the hon. Member mean by foreign policy? You can lay down sound and general propositions. You can say that your foreign policy is to maintain peace; you can say that it is to protect British interests, you can say that it is to use your influence, such as it is, on behalf of the right against the wrong, as far as you can tell the right from the wrong. You can lay down all these as general principles, but that is not a policy. Surely, if you are to have a policy you must take the particular situations and consider what action or inaction is suitable for those particular situations. That is what I myself mean by policy, and it is quite clear that as the situations and conditions in foreign affairs continually change from day to  day your policy cannot be stated once and for all if it is to be applicable to every situation that arises.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;56;I repeat that nobody knows how many there are on either side. The first thing to do is to ascertain the numbers, and if they can be ascertained by an international Commission, as is proposed, then the proposal is that the withdrawals shall be in the proportion of those numbers as found on the two sides.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;79;That was not stated in the Italian Note. Is the Commission to go on and make arrangements for a total withdrawal? The Italian suggestion was that first there should be a withdrawal of man for man on each side, and what I was asking was what would be the  amount, because if I am correct, or if the general reports are correct, there are four or five times as many on the rebel side as on the Government side.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;122;That is the point that I was coming to. Let us be quite clear. The ultimate proposal is that all the volunteers should be withdrawn, and if that is so, obviously there must be more on one side withdrawn than on the other, if the numbers are greater on one side than on the other. The only question, therefore, is what is to happen in the meantime. It may take some time, and surely we are not going to wait and have no withdrawals at all until these figures are accurately ascertained. Therefore, the proposal is that what is called a token withdrawal should take place, of a comparatively small number, and that that number should be equal on the two sides.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;16;That is exactly what my point was—what kind of amount is meant by a token withdrawal.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;162;I said a comparatively trifling or small amount, but the number has not actually been fixed. Supposing it was 5,000. I do not say it is, for a moment—it may not be as many as that—but supposing it was 5,000 from either side, I do not think there is anything unfair in that. The surplus of volunteers on one side would remain exactly the same as before the withdrawals. The next question of the right hon. Gentleman was whether, while this withdrawal was taking place, it would be open to other Powers to go on pouring arms and munitions or weapons into Spain. Of course, anything of the kind would stultify the whole procedure, and the proposal is this, to see that there shall be no further intervention while withdrawals are taking place. Anyhow, the Government would not consider an arrangement at all satisfactory or acceptable which allowed further volunteers to be poured in while nominally we were withdrawing troops already there.
1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;42;I suggested there were certain technicalities with regard to territorial waters that had not been objected to when it was a question of rescuing Franco, but which were said to be standing in the way of rescuing the supporters of the Government.

1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Chamberlain.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;48;I thought the right hon.

1937-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Chamberlain.txt;1937-10-21;Foreign Affairs;127;The Leader of the Opposition and also the right hon. Member for Caithness both expressed regret and surprise that my right hon. Friend had not spoken again of the speech which was delivered by President Roosevelt, although he and I took the first opportunity after that speech was made public of expressing our satisfaction at what President Roosevelt had said and our intention to co-operate with him as far as 1:hat might be possible. If I may quote the words I myself used, the right hon. Gentleman will see that he had no grounds for suggesting that we, in contradistinction to President Roosevelt, have no ideas and no policy and no word of welcome for the gesture made by the President from across the Atlantic. I said:

1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;113;The hon. Member has mentioned that he wrote me a letter on 11th March, and he was good enough, after some conversation later on with an hon. Friend who helps me with my work here, to send me a copy of the letter. I only received the copy the day before yesterday, and he only sent me the copy, because the actual letter never reached me at all. I have a very efficient staff which deals with my correspondence, but no trace of the receipt of this letter can be found. The hon. Member, therefore, did not read the letter to the House as he was good enough to tell me he intended.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;31;Last week the hon. Member sent me notice that he was going to read the letter, but, having heard that it was not received, he did not intend to read it.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;224;The letter was in no way relevant to the particular small point which led to some of our discussions. It offered no explanation why he did not address his Private Notice Question on 11th March to the Secretary of State for War, whom it concerned. Now he has explained that the reason he did not read it is because it had to be addressed to me in my capacity of Minister of Defence presiding over the three Services. But  that was not the reason he gave when he rang up my private secretary on the afternoon of 10th March. He rang up to give notice that he was going to put the Question by private notice, and he gave the text of the Question. It was taken down by one of my secretaries, and a note was made of the conversation, and he was immediately told that such a Question ought to be addressed to the Secretary of State for War. What was the reason he gave? Was it that the Minister of Defence must deal with these matters? Not at all. He said it concerned the Prime Minister's son. That is a small point, but I think it justifies me in considering that there has been a certain personal flavour in the zest with which the hon. Member has brought this thing forward.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;83;The only point of interest is that the hon. Gentleman has given a different reason for not putting the Question to the Secretary of State for War from the reason he gave to one whom I regard as a highly credible witness. There was no reason why the Question should not have been put in the ordinary course to my right hon. Friend, who would have dealt with it. I do not want to dwell unduly upon the personal aspect of the Question.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;140;The word "unduly" is arguable, but I wonder whether, if this letter in the "Evening Standard" had been written by any other hon. Member of the House, it would have attracted the energetic attention of the hon. Member who raised this matter. There are, of course, elements on both sides of the Atlantic who indulge in this form of badinage. The President of the United States presents a much larger target than I do, as he has no fewer than four sons serving, whereas I have only one. When  points are raised it is no use having all the points raised by one side and then to be told that one is dwelling unduly on those points when they are answered. I therefore leave the personal aspect while expressing all my acknowledgments to the hon. Member for his unfailing courtesy.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;75;I think I might be allowed to proceed to unfold this matter. It is a small matter, but if the hon. Member regards it as important, I will gladly give way when I have finished my sentence. The Assistant Director of Public Relations acted in this case, and he passed the letter, censored it and stamped it. The War Office considered that he exercised his discretion rightly, having regard to the contents of the document.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;46;I do not know whether that is true, but it ought not to be true if it is. In this case the letter was shown in an open way to the Assistant Director of Public Relations and was passed by him after he had examined it.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;85;That is what I have been trying to say with as much plainness as the English language allows.  That is my point. It is a new point and a different point from that which I was in a position to make on the information available last time. The letter was franked and censored by an officer entitled to take that step. Consequently, as far as the hon. and gallant Member for Preston is concerned, there is no case against him for having committed any irregularity.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;60;I think anyone who follows my argument will see that I should not think that was true. As I have said, the House can judge. The letter was a proper one, and there is no doubt it passed through channels which vouched for it, and what is the use of the hon. Member interrupting by saying "Except in North Africa"?
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;549;There is no reason at all why such a letter should not have been written by an officer serving in this country to "The Times" or to the "Observer" or any other newspaper, and if it were passed by the censor in North Africa, the North African aspect goes. I am on the larger aspect, and I had not intended to be drawn back on to this smaller point, which has such a strange fascination for the hon. Member. But certainly the answer of the Secretary of State on 16th June, 1942, does require restatement in such a way as to show the full implications both of Articles 541 and  547 upon the writing of communications to the Press by Service personnel on controversial matters. It would certainly be very detrimental to the conduct of the war if we had a general diversion of the energies of the Army from the sword to the pen, and since this discussion has had such very wide publicity it is very likely that a number of officers and men will be encouraged to utilise the opportunity. Therefore, we must make a restatement of the rule upon this point in such a way as to show the full force of Articles 541 and 547. The Admiralty rules in this matter are somewhat stricter than those of the Army, and it is for consideration whether the Army and the Air Force practice should be brought into closer conformity with that prevailing in the Navy. So much I am saying for the ordinary serving officer or soldier, here or anywhere else, but the position of Members of Parliament as representatives of the electors is quite different from that of other serving officers and soldiers. Articles 541 and 547 clearly cannot be applied in their full rigour. Members have their political responsibilities and have an undoubted right to take part in political and party controversy. That is the whole nature of their function. The House has hitherto shown itself desirous that such rights should be fully maintained. We have seen in many of our Debates serving Members taking the freest part not only in political Debates but in the military aspects of affairs, including—and this, I think, is the most questionable case of all—giving information which they have derived from the unit in which they have been serving, and no great harm has come from it. The only remedy which the War Office has against Members of Parliament exercising their political functions apart from matters affecting military security is to suggest to them that they should devote their whole attention to their military duties. Hitherto, after 42 months of war, this has never yet been found necessary in the Army. It shows, I think, how very well the system has worked as far as Members of Parliament are concerned, in spite of some obvious anomalies and the obvious difficulty of reconciling the two functions of a serving officer and a Member of this House. It has worked in this way because of the good sense and discretion of those concerned, and in view of this I cannot believe that the House would  wish any new or special restriction to be placed upon the discretion of Members of Parliament who are at the same time serving officers.
1943-3-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-23;Army Officer's Letter To Press;50;That is so until and unless any further statement is made as to the tightening-up of these rules, which may be necessary if an agitation is going to be started or efforts are made to break through them.

I do not think that matters will be helped forward by repeated Questions and answers in the House of Commons. I gave a carefully considered reply on 20th October, and nothing has occurred since which enables me to add to it; but if I have at any time any information to give the House, I can assure the hon. Members who have raised the matter that I shall seek the earliest opportunity to do so.

But I cannot pretend that the statement is of momentous importance. It is only because we are all together in this matter that I thought that the House would be most anxious to be kept fully informed, as it is my duty to do whenever possible. After a good deal of intense bombing of Suda Bay and the various aerodromes in the neighbourhood, about 1,500 enemy troops, wearing New Zealand battle-dress, landed by gliders, parachutes and troop-carriers in the Canea-Maleme area. This message was sent at 12 o'clock to-day, when the military reported that the situation was in hand. Apparently the capture of Maleme aerodrome was the enemy's object, and this has so far failed.

I should be very loth to separate myself from the course of referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges, but I trust I may be permitted to submit to  you one or two observations upon this peculiar case, the like of which I have not seen in my experience of 42 years' actual service in this House. Are we really to understand that the Members of this new House of Commons, just elected by the people, fresh from contact with the people, are going to be frightened out of their wits by something like this? [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Are they really? [Interruption.] I know hon. Members opposite do not want free speech anywhere. They will go further and further along the road to destroy it. Why should we suppose that Members of this House, many of whom enjoyed great majorities at the Election and are in close contact with their constituents, will be deterred from doing what they conscientiously believe is their public duty because——

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);245;I really cannot conceive that Members would feel deterred from giving a vote according to their duty and conscience, because some printing firm splashes a poster of an insulting character about the walls of the metropolis. Who has ever said, "You may not put up a poster of an insulting character against anybody or anything, subject, of course to the ordinary laws of life "? Who would insinuate that this House of Commons has already got into such a dither that it is afraid of the vulgar chatter and clamour which arise in the streets? It does seem to me mere panic and that we are ill conceiving our dignity if, because a firm of printers chooses to say that our names will be published if we vote this way or that in a particular Division and applies terms of abuse such as "dictators" whichever  way we vote, we suggest that the House should take action under the great procedure of Privilege. It is a formidable procedure, reserved for cases of a very special character as, for instance, if a poster were put about saying that certain Members had committed a certain crime or had certain particular advantages offered to them and which reflected upon their private honour. In that event, I quite agree there would be a breach of Privilege, but I do not see how the House can press for referring this to a Committee of Privileges when after all it is only——

I mean a threat to knock a man on the head if he votes for bread rationing, is one the House could act upon at once, but a threat to call a fellow a dictator, is really one which is not good enough. I can only say that I shall not ask any of my friends on this side of the House to oppose by a Division, the Motion referring the matter to the Committee of Privileges, because I feel that you, Mr. Speaker, having given your Ruling, the matter must take that course and I do not want to offer any divergence from your Ruling as such. At the same time, I must put on record my statement to the House that they must stand up and be men. It is very unfortunate that this newly elected House should show itself so extremely sensitive and touchy. Here is the hon. Member for Watford (Mr. J. Freeman), who was a gallant officer. Are we to believe that he feels himself deterred and intimidated from doing his duty, because he is going to be called a dictator? This is a very good example of the touchiness and timidity which have already overtaken this vast and newly returned majority—[Interruption.] I am not at all disturbed by that noise; I take the rough with the smooth. Let me make it clear as regards referring this matter to the Committee of Privileges, that we on this side do not oppose the reference, because we are sure that the sensible Committee of Privileges—and who will claim that our  Committee of Privileges is not sensible—will put this matter in its proper place, and allay the anxiety and thin skinnedness of some of our mighty populist and democratic leaders.

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;Privilege (Poster);58;I withdraw the word "instigated" and I substitute the word "incited"; the hon. Member is welcome to the difference between them— that they have incited this printer to commit this offence. I ask that that absolutely false and, if I may avail myself of the latitude which has been given on previous occasions, I will say, lying assertion——

Gentleman did' not suggest that the death sentence upon this Jew had been respited on account of the hostages which had been taken by the Jewish terrorists. If that were so,  I should like to ask: Is it not a very serious thing to turn aside from the normal path of justice because of threats of murder by terrorists launched against hostages whom they have taken?

1941-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-12-08;Prime Minister's Declaration;189;As soon as I heard, last night, that Japan had attacked the United States, I felt it necessary that Parliament should be immediately summoned. It is indispensable to our system of government that Parliament should play its full part in all the important acts of State and at all the crucial moments of the war; and I am glad to see that so many Members have been able to be in their places, despite the shortness of the notice. With the full approval of the nation, and of the Empire, I pledged the word of Great Britain, about a month ago, that should the United States be involved in war with Japan, a British declaration of war would follow within the hour. I, therefore, spoke to President Roosevelt on the Atlantic telephone last night, with a view to arranging the timing of our respective declarations. The President told me that he would this morning send a Message to Congress, which, of course, as is well known, can alone make a declaration of war on behalf of the United States, and I then assured him that we would follow immediately.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;27;I think that the right hon. Gentleman must have made a mistake in the date. The peak date for unemployment was in the Coalition Government of 1931.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;114;It was in the Coalition Government of 1931 that reduced the unemployed from the figure of nearly three million to just above one million, and it was the right hon. Gentleman, even in these days of full employment and shortage of labour, who managed to raise unemployment to over two million at the beginning of the present year by gross mismanagement of the fuel problem. All this myth about the tragedy of unemployment between the wars—[HON. MEMBERS: "Myth?"] The myth is that  it was due to the Conservative Party, yet all the peaks and heights were reached and all the most serious causes occurred during the brief terms when the Socialists were in office.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;120;Certainly we are not defending it. I must say that the Government themselves seem to be a little more reconciled to it than they used to be, judging by the number of Socialist hereditary nobles who are being created. If they do not like the character of the brake, why do they not propose the reform of the Second Chamber? We are quite ready to confer with them and to help them in such a task. As the Socialist Government now stand, they maintain the hereditary principle. The hereditary Chamber is to have one year's suspensory veto but not two. One year's suspensory veto by a hereditary assembly is the true blue of Socialist democracy; two years is class tyranny.

1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;44;I am glad to be reminded because I asked this morning for a check-up to be made over the British Empire, and I was not aware that there was a single-Chamber Government in Queensland, but that State is only part of a federal system.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;143;No free country of which I have heard up to the present—I quite agree that there might be some countries throughout the world—which is enjoying democratic institutions has adopted single-Chamber Government. The United States, the Swiss, the Dutch, the Belgians, the French even in their latest constitution have a Second Chamber. Eire has created its own Senate. Our Dominions, the most democratic countries in the world, all have, with the exception of Queensland I am reminded, sought and preserved two-Chamber Government—what clever people would call bi-cameral Government. All feel that between the chance vote of an election on universal sufferage and the permanent alteration of the whole slowly built structure of the State and nation there ought to be some modifying process. Show me a powerful, successful, free democratic constitution of a great sovereign state which has adopted the principle of single-Chamber Government.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;92;Norway is not a very powerful State and would not have been a State at all but for our exertions. I am speaking of the general experience of the world and I say that the overwhelming majority that I know of have a Second Chamber, mostly with lesser powers than the popular assembly and with a different outlook and function. By the way, all this insistence on Norway or Queensland by the other side of the House illustrates  and proves my point that it is single-Chamber Government which hon. Gentlemen opposite seek.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;39;The hon. Gentleman the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. S. Silverman) is not in this matter at all. There are quite a lot of matters in which he takes an interest but this is not one of them.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;14;I do not mind in the least being interrupted. It does not worry me—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;122;I do not give way unless I think it worth while. Some of the foreign countries arrive at the two-chamber system by a proportion of members retiring every two years or every year; some by a franchise based on a higher age limit; some by the influence of local authorities standing on a different foundation; and some, like the Canadian Senate, are nominated for life and retire gradually by the effluxion of time. In some there are joint sessions where a majority decision decides in case of deadlock. I remember in 1910 we worked in the hectic interval between the two Elections of that year in conference with the Opposition but it broke down as so many other things do, on figures.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;83;I see that the Home Secretary is going to follow me. I am sorry for him, too. He always wears the air of injured innocence which we might expect to find on the face of a virtuous and respectable mayor or alderman who has been caught in a somewhat disreputable and compromising situation. I ask him: does he really think he can cling to office for 2½ years more until this Bill has passed into law under the workings of the Parliament Act?
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;220;Craft is common both to skill and deceit. No doubt it will be helpful to party discipline to be able to say to an unhappy, disillusioned party, "We must hold together until we get the Parliament Bill through and thus carry our glorious nationalisation of steel which will put the country right once and for all. Hold on." It is a powerful appeal, "Hold on, boys, for another year. Let us have a full run for our money. Let us get all out of it we can." I do not think it will happen that way. If there were a General Election tomorrow the Socialist majority would vanish. If they wait another year, they themselves will vanish for a considerable period, unwept, unhonoured, and unsung—and unhung. They have paralysed and stifled the whole native life-effort of our people. Do not let them delude themselves by supposing that they will escape on the issue of "the Peers versus the People." The electors are going to vote on their mismanagement and on their partisanship in this grave crisis in our history. Their calculations will not succeed. They will not escape, even by this partial Measure, the will of the people, and the longer they try to do so, the more decisive will be the condemnation they will receive at the national hands.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;2;And now.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;51;That really does not quite do justice to Mr. Chamberlain, because the reason why he resigned was not because of any defeat in the House of Commons or that he could not gather support to continue, but because he felt that nothing short of a National Government could save the country.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;10;I strongly urged Mr. Chamberlain to continue as Prime Minister.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;64;The Prime Minister has no right to demand a Dissolution—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—and the right hon.

1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;8;That is the right hon. Gentleman's personal opinion.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;38;Everyone expresses his personal opinion, but the right hon. Gentleman, speaking for the Government, is attempting to outline their views on constitutional law, which have no foundation other than the fact that he has decided to utter them.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;141;We have had from the right hon. Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) an extremely reasonable, good-tempered speech which was in marked contrast to the speech delivered earlier in the day by the Leader of the Opposition, and it was very welcome. The right hon. Gentleman said that we were discussing a matter of high constitutional importance, and we have been told by other hon. Members that this is a matter of very great constitutional importance. Yet, except during the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, the opening speeches and the intervention of the Leader of the Opposition, the general aspect of the benches in the House, and particularly the benches opposite, has been like the end of a rather dull Adjournment Debate at about half-past ten at night. Not that I expect to see the benches thronged with Members—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;89;Whenever I have been here there has been a very scanty attendance; and I have had reports from my colleagues on the Front Bench that there has been a very scanty attendance all through. I do not make a great point of it, except to say that this is not—as represented, as far as I can make out, in the point of view of hon. Members opposite—a matter of vast constitutional importance. In fact, the right hon. Gentleman ended up by saying that this was a small, niggling Bill.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;63;Well, they cannot have it both ways. The fact is, the Opposition have not made up their minds about this Bill. With characteristic impulsiveness, the Leader of the Opposition at once dashed in with a violent objects on to this Bill, and hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have been compelled to follow suit. We have been accused of drawing a red herring—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;164;It has been said that we are introducing this Bill in order to draw attention away from our alleged shortcomings. If this were so and if this were our intention, surely the obvious tactics would have been to have tried to raise a first-class row with the House of Lords on some particular issue. That was the method employed in the 1906 Parliament, known as "filling up the cup"; things were sent up to the House of Lords to get them thrown out in order to make a case in the country. But we, on the contrary, instead of waiting to have a controversy with the House of Lords, have tried to prevent any constitutional difficulty by meeting the matter before it arises. The obvious thing, if we had wanted to stage the thing for electoral ends, would have been to create a first-class row on something or other, and to have gone to the country with the cry of Lords against the Commons.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;26;Yes, but the fact is that they do not operate evenly and fairly, and never have done. They have always been against parties of the Left—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;174;I do not want to waste time, and I have already dealt with that point. Members opposite might try to attend to the argument. I have said that during the last two years we have been under the protection of the Parliament Act. When that ceases to protect us we cannot tell what might be done by another place. With all respect to the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Warwick and Leamington, he does not know what the other place may do. There are 100 or so peers who attend there regularly, but the great mass are in the wilderness, and at any time may come in and overturn anything. I put it to Members opposite: supposing the position were reversed, supposing a potential majority were against them in another place, all drawn from the party on this side—and, let me say, not from the most intelligent followers of this party. Would they like the position that at any moment the whole of their programme might be upset? Of course, they would not.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;31;The hon. and gallant Member really has not done himself justice. There is not a majority for the Conservative Party in the country, but there is a majority in the Lords.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;120;There is not much point in that interjection. I am trying to deal with the point put by the right hon. Gentleman. I say—and this is the doctrine of my party—that there is in 1he other Chamber no distinct voice of the people that can over-rule the opinions expressed by the elected representatives sent here. If we want a revising Chamber at all, it may have a period of delay for revising, for looking at details, and may be very useful, but the first thing about a Second Chamber is that it should not have comparable powers with the lower House. I do not know if any suggestion has been put forward from the other side with regard to that.
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;32;I generally give way, but I am interrupted so often that I find I do not have time to say what I want to say. I should like to ask the Opposition—
1947-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-11;Parliament Bill;160;Hon. Members opposite have accused us of embarking on partisanship. I want to ask whether the opposition to this Bill is really based on some constitutional principle or whether it is only based on the fact that it is convenient for them to have greater power for their party in the House of Lords? Not one single argument has been put forward to suggest that it is essential that there should be two years' delay when the Conservative Party are in power. We had very strong objections in this House to Mr. Chamberlain's Government. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford was in opposition, as were many other Members, who were gravely disturbed in their minds, but they were under the iron hand of Captain Margesson. They never got any helping hand  from the House of Lords, and under this theory that the House of Lords are in close touch with the people, they might surely have taken action.

I rely upon those statements, and when I read them over again last night in preparation for this Debate I found it very difficult to improve upon them or alter them in any way. This may accuse me of infertility of mind, but it also gives me some confidence that I have not misled the House or felt myself stultified, in all respects at any rate, by the harsh and unforeseeable movement of events It is not often that one wishes to repeat what one said two months ago, and still less 10 months ago, but I propose to do so, because in no other way and in no other words that I can think of can I remind the House of and bring home to them the grim, bare bones of the Polish problem.

The proposal of the Australian Government was that they should have a representative at the War Cabinet who should have the right to be heard in the formulation and direction of policy. I replied that we were in agreement with this proposal, and for a good many months past Sir Earle Page has been exercising these rights. We have informed the Governments of Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa that the same facilities are available for them if they wish to take advantage of them. We have as yet had no formal reply from New Zealand. I understand that Canada and South Africa are satisfied with the existing arrangements for consultation—indeed they expressed themselves strongly an this point—and do not at present wish to attach special representatives to the War Cabinet here.

The charge on the Consolidated Fund fixed by the Civil List Act of 1937 has remained unchanged, but the increase in the cost of wages, goods and services provided from the Civil List has resulted in deficits in recent years, causing heavy demands upon His Majesty's Privy Purse, which have been met by His Majesty from savings accumulated during the war. These savings are now exhausted and His Majesty's Government have decided as from 1st April, 1951, to relieve the Civil List of the cost of certain services.

I agree with him entirely that a Debate of a discursive character arising before these issues have been properly weighed by the House might easily be detrimental to our national interest, which always must claim the allegiance of Members wherever they sit, and I think I can give my assurance on behalf of the hon. Gentlemen who are associated with me on this side of the House that we shall not touch upon this matter in the forthcoming Debate on the Adjournment. Words or phrases might be used which would hamper the task of our negotiators in the difficult matters which lie before them. I think the utmost restraint should be practised, not only in the House, but, if I may say so, also out of doors, in all comments on the American situation at the present time. I cannot believe that it is the last word of the United States; I cannot believe that so great a nation whose  Lend-Lease policy was characterised by me as "the most unsordid act in the history of the world," would proceed in a rough and harsh manner to hamper a faithful Ally, the Ally who held the fort while their own American armaments were preparing.

1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;118;The right hon. Gentleman may be sure I am not trying  to shirk anything. I just want to get the facts correct. His question was not an exact repetition of what had been put before. I am not denying, in the least, anything I said then, and I shall have something more to say about it. I want to point out that on the first two occasions to which I have referred conditions were very different from what they are to-day. At neither of those times was war imminent, and I think I may fairly say that there was no question present in the mind of anybody at that time which appeared then likely to lead to war.
1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;55;The hon. Member is perfectly correct. I am referring to the two previous ones. On those occasions the Czecho-Slovak question had not emerged into a prominent position. Although it is true that various countries, including our own, were rearming, yet the rearmament did not reach either the dimensions or the pace which characterises it to-day.

1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;160;I was a little disappointed with the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair) and the attitude he has felt it his duty to adopt. We have been in very general agreement upon the great steps which have been taken in foreign policy, and I was rather hoping that he would find in this Debate an opportunity for carrying the excellent leadership he has shown in these matters of foreign affairs one step further in the sphere of defence, because certainly no one has been a more strenuous advocate of the enlargement of our responsibilities and of the vigorous championship of our rights and interests than my right hon. Friend, and it is somewhat discouraging to find that at the first really awkward fence, if I may put it in that way, with which he has been confronted, he has found it necessary to take such a very strong attitude of opposition.
1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;202;They were able to do so. But there is a difference now. Then the cause was explained and the nation accepted the explanation and rallied to the cause. But now the impulse, the main impulse, to resist the Nazi dictatorship principles comes from the mass of the people. I think in every country with which we are associated, in all those European countries—countries trembling on the verge, like Yugoslavia—the drive of the people is strong. It is very often the Governments who are hesitating. Here the spirit of the people has been ahead of the  Government, and it may even be found to be ahead of Parliament also. There is still time for the countries which are ruled by the dictators to place themselves in harmony with the overwhelming majority of the human race and in harmony with its irresistible forward movement. That must be our hope, and I earnestly hope, although conscientious differences must be expressed, that everything will be done to avoid giving encouragement at this juncture to these dictators, or that they may be led to suppose that we are not ready, with other like-minded States, to go to all lengths in doing our share of the common duty.
1939-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1939-4-27;Compulsory Military Training;77;The hon. and gallant Member misunderstood my argument. My point is that the obligations which we had already would mean a great military effort, and that if war broke out there would be a call upon all our resources. The fact that we had accepted an additional obligation here and an additional obligation there did not necessarily mean an intensification of that effort, because if the worst came to the worst we should need all our strength.

Member for Wood Green (Mr. Baxter) has not got it right. There is no question of legislation on the commercial agreement. The commercial agreement is a point which is going to be discussed at an international conference, and the matter is intimately bound up  with other matters. All that is suggested is, not a unilateral abandonment of preferences, but discussions for a general reduction of trade barriers in which the reduction of preferences might form a part. No legislation is required on that.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Anglo-American Economic And Financial Agreement;33;The answer is, "No." I think perhaps hon.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Anglo-American Economic And Financial Agreement;26;I have already replied to that point. Our practice in this House is that the Government should take responsibility for the Measures which they bring forward.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Anglo-American Economic And Financial Agreement;62;I quite agree, and I do not grudge it to the hon.

1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;320;When I spoke on Thursday last, I stated that I could give only an incomplete account of the operations, and that a further statement would be made this week, when I hoped to be able to give a fuller story. I also intimated that I was obliged to impose a certain reticence upon myself, in order to avoid saying anything which might involve risk to our troops. Since then, no doubt, hon. Members have realised that, while at that time it was known that our Forces had been withdrawn from Andalsnes, we still had to withdraw troops from Namsos, and I was extremely anxious not to give any hint of an operation that was bound to be even more dangerous than the withdrawal from Andalsnes, both on account of the larger number of men to be taken off and of the fact that it would be possible for the Germans to bring there the whole available force of their bombers. Now, I am able once again to pay my tribute to  the very remarkable skill of our naval and military Forces, who managed to effect this withdrawal, in the course of one single short night, without suffering any loss in the operation. The danger which they were running is illustrated by the fact that early on the following morning the Germans discovered that the troops were returning in their ships, and they sent a force of some 50 bombers to attack them. Considering that this convoy was outside the range of our fighters and that it had to depend, therefore, solely upon the anti-aircraft fire of the ships, I think we may count ourselves fortunate that we did not lose more than one British and one French destroyer—His Majesty's Ship "Afridi" and the French ship "Bison." By this time the men from Namsos and those from Andalsnes are back again, and the campaign in Southern Norway is at an end.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;67;Well it was not expected that it would be necessary, but I see that it is stated that Ministers were to blame for that. Ministers, of course, must be expected to be blamed for everything. [Hon. Members: "They missed the bus."] There were reports emanating from Stockholm—maybe invented by the enemy—which roused expectations which were never justified, and which were certainly never endorsed by any Ministers. [Interruption.]
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;180;We did our best to damp down these unfounded reports. Of course, we had to be careful not to say anything which would inform the enemy of the true situation, and I am afraid that in the circumstances the shock and the disappointment were inevitable. I will try to examine the history and the causes of this failure, and I will try to answer some questions. I do not wish to extenuate anything, but at the same time I hope that we shall not exaggerate the extent or the importance of the check which we have received. The withdrawal from Southern Norway is not comparable to the withdrawal from Gallipoli. There were no large forces involved. The fact was, it was not much more than a single division, and our losses, therefore, were not really great in number, nor was there any considerable or valuable amount of stores left behind. It must be remembered, as I have already pointed out, that if we had losses, the Germans had far heavier losses in warships, in planes, in transport and in men.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;27;Does the hon. Member want the date and the hour? If so, he had better put a Question down. It is not very long ago—since 11th April.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;89;Yes, Sir. My right hon. Friend feels that that would be the best arrangement, and I am inclined to think that the important work at the Admiralty should remain in his hands if it is possible, but I am relying upon him to let me know if he finds that the new tasks which have been imposed upon him make it difficult for him to fulfil them and the work at the Admiralty as well. Then, of course, in such a case I shall take steps to relieve him
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;300;I appreciate the point. No, it was not before the Norwegian operations; it has only been made recently and did not arise out of the Norwegian operations, because the change would have been made in any case. For the purposes I have mentioned my right hon. Friend has been provided with a small personal staff under a distinguished staff officer, Major-General Ismay, and General Ismay has been appointed an additional member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee. I have no doubt other changes in the form of Government or the functions of individual members of it may from time to time suggest themselves as desirable. I think it is very likely that changes of that kind in war-time are almost bound to take place. As far as I am concerned, I shall endeavour to keep my mind open to any fresh considerations and to take any steps which may seem to be called for if they will help the country. Once again I want to urge hon. Members that in these strenuous days we should do better to occupy ourselves with increasing our war effort rather than disputing about the form of Government. It is in the production of materials, the production of planes, the production of tanks  and guns, and munitions, and all the countless articles of equipment which are required to fit out our weapons and make them useful; it is in the production of these things that we want organisation, energy and good will. As far as we in the Government are concerned, we are doing all we can to overtake the start which Germany has obtained during her long years of preparation. We are getting to-day the wholehearted co-operation of employers and workers; we want also to get the co-operation of hon. Members of all parties.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;92;The co-operation of Members of all parties, if not the co-operation of all Members of all parties, in a work which everyone recognises to be the prime need to-day. We do not set ourselves up as being infallible, as being above receiving help from others who are willing to help. Let us then before these trials come upon us put all our strength into the work of preparing for them, and we shall thus steadily increase our strength until we ourselves are able to deliver our blows where and when we will.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;220;It was represented, not that this would be a matter of hit and then go away again, but that here was a chance of the campaign opening up. It is no good hon. Members quarrelling with my statement; that view was taken. Therefore, there is widespread disappointment at this setback. It is said that in this war hitherto there has never been any initiative from our side, and it is said also that there is no real planning in anticipation of the possible strokes that will be taken against us. I think we must examine this affair from that aspect. If we look back, we find that the Government had the idea of blocking with mines the route to Narvik. I do not intend to discuss whether that was or was not a good idea, but if that was to be done, it must have been apparent to those who intended to do it that there was the very greatest possibility of a hit back by Germany. The first question I want to put is, what provision was made for that contingency? The Prime Minister said that Germany had planned this expedition with very great care over a long period. I want to know what care was exercised in planning the means for defeating that stroke if it should come.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;9;I said that they would take a heavy toll.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;126;I quite agree that the right hon. Gentleman said they would not do it with impunity but I think he gave us encouragement. After all, in considering the inception of this expedition that is one of the vital factors—how far we could prevent those reinforcements being made.  One has to recognise, also, that an unknown quantity was the extent of the defence which the Norwegians could put up. But the gravamen of my attack on the Government is that it does not seem that there was a thinking-out of our plans beforehand, that there was not adequate Intelligence, that there was not the necessary concentration on the essential objective and I ask whether, at any time, there was not delay and discussion where action was necessary?
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;79;I think the right hon. Gentleman misunderstood me. I did not say that he was to be chairman of the Chiefs of Staff. I said he was to give guidance and direction to them. That does not mean that he will necessarily attend at every meeting of the Chiefs of Staff. The right hon. Gentleman will notice that he has an officer who is attached to him and who is an official member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;254;The point is that the right hon. Gentleman is now to be given a rather exceptional position as being the member of the War Cabinet who is more particularly concerned with major strategy. It is against all good rules of organisation that a man who is in charge of major strategy should also be in command of a particular unit. It is like having a man commanding an army in  the field and also commanding a division. He has a divided interest between the wider questions of strategy and the problems affecting his own immediate command. The First Lord of the Admiralty has great abilities, but it is not fair to him that he should be put into an impossible position like that. Our friends have been disheartened. We have had a reverse, but we have had reverses before and no one of us is in the slightest degree shaken in his faith that we are going to win this war. When we have reverses, the essential thing is that we should learn from them and should not repeat our mistakes. I have no doubt whatever in the courage and constancy of all the people of this country, provided they get the right lead, but the Government will be blind and deaf, if they do not realise that there is widespread anxiety among the people of this country—people of all views and of all kinds of thought. They are not satisfied that the war is being waged with sufficient energy, intensity, drive and resolution.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;17;The point was that they had to join us and then there could be an effective defence.

Gentleman asks what was the use of keeping the force if we had not the ships. We had ships in which troops could be conveyed, but they were warships and not merchant ships.
1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;19;I did not say that. It is a mistake to assume that no troopships were used on any occasion.

1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;29;I understood that troops were being specially kept for this expedition, and my point was that they should  not have included troops who had had only two months' training.

1940-5-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1940-5-07;Conduct Of The War;53;My point was that the Government, having all these men assembled and ready within a very short time of taking a decision which might lead to the need for employing them and their equipment, dispersed them straight away and then came to a decision to take a risk for which they were needed.

I cannot refer to it without saying that there is nothing personal about the Chairman of the Committee; it is a constitutional issue which is involved, and which we think ought to be cleared out of the way. The longer it remains in its present indeterminate position, the more danger there is of people in the country reading these words and using them perhaps with an undue freedom. Therefore, it seems desirable that the matter should be settled, and I am glad to have the assurance of the right hon. Gentleman.

1946-5-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1946-5-24;Egypt (Treaty Negotiations);269;I am rather surprised at the line the right hon. Gentleman takes on this matter. A statement was made with regard to Government policy. There was a Debate, in which I took part and in which the Lord President took part. The right hon. Gentleman then asked for further time for discussion, and accordingly it was arranged that we should have this Debate. It occurs on a Friday, which is a Supply Day. I have been present at a great many Debates on Supply Days, and I am certainly not prepared to say that it is without precedent for a Minister not to rise immediately after the first speaker. Over and over again there have been full Debates with a winding-up speech from the Minister when he has heard the whole of what the House has to say. When it is a question of a Supply Day on which a Minister deals with a range of supply, it is quite natural that he should open, but when a Supply Day is specifically asked for by the Opposition in order that they may put their point of view and give the Committee an opportunity of putting its point of view, it is a perfectly reasonable thing—there is plenty of precedent for it—for the Minister who is under criticism to wait until he has heard the criticisms before he replies. Therefore, I say that there is nothing whatever unusual in this, and I think my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is fully entitled to hear what is to be said in order that he can reply to the whole Debate.

I will give him complete acquittal on that. He may leave the dock without a stain upon his character. This alternative of Palestine, which the Government may be cherishing, in order to protect the Canal, is disastrous to us and unduly complicating to all the other policies they were hopefully pursuing.

I suppose that the House will wish, on some convenient occasion, to debate the general position of our foreign affairs, but we on this side of the House should be very ready to consult the Government's convenience in the matter as to whether it should be next week or the week after. I would suggest, if it were agreeable, that discussions should proceed through the usual channels with a view to determining what time would be most in accordance with convenience and the public interest for the discussion on this matter to be resumed.

1954-5-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-5-06;Indo-China (Uk-Us Policy);61;Why should the right hon. Gentleman assume that a Question of  this kind is mischief-making when it is quite clear that there has been trouble in the United States as to exactly our attitude, and when a little clarification might make for better understanding and not mischief-making, which is far from the wish of those on this side of the House?
1954-5-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-5-06;Indo-China (Uk-Us Policy);28;I think it is quite possible that a general statement upon the relations might be advantageous, but not a statement on the differences of opinion at this juncture.

His Majesty has never spared himself in his unswerving devotion to the heavy and onerous duties of his high office. The twelve years of his reign have been years of strain and anxiety, and His Majesty's steadfast bearing under all the trials of war and peace has done much to keep his people in good heart and courage.

On behalf of the Conservative Party, I wish to say that we associate ourselves fully with the spirit and the words of the statement he has just made to us. We share to the full the deep regret which he has expressed at the news this morning's newspapers contained. We share also the inevitable disappointment which will be felt in Australia and in New Zealand, but we are quite sure that there is only one paramount duty immediately incumbent upon His Majesty's Ministers, and that is to advise the King to rest and give himself, in the prime of life as he is, every possible chance of recovering his full strength.
1952-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-11-25;Kenya (Situation);109;May I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that while we must guard against abuse of the use of this Standing Order, it is essential that its use should be guarded in proper cases. I find it a little difficult to understand why, because there is a continuing series of events, if some particular event comes into prominence it should not be raised. If that is so, it seems to me that at any time when there were disturbances in the Colonies, Ireland, or anywhere else—or even an industrial dispute like that at Tonypandy—one would be precluded from raising one particular issue because of the continuance of the trouble.
1952-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-11-25;Kenya (Situation);52;Further to that point of order. Is it not within your recollection, Mr. Speaker, that on a number of occasions when this question has been put forward it has always been possible to submit reasons to Mr. Speaker for his consideration without in any way suggesting that we are controverting his Ruling?
1952-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-11-25;Kenya (Situation);106;Might I suggest that it would be better for a debate to be arranged through the usual channels instead of on a precise, specific mattes  of this kind? The usual channels can be a medium for arriving at an occasion when a debate on the whole situation in Kenya can take place and—though this is hardly relevant and I ask the indulgence of the House—is it not really dangerous at this critical moment to do anything which weakens the confidence of the handful of Europeans in the discharge of their duty, upon which the prevention, perhaps, of the massacre of large numbers of white people depends?
1954-1-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-1-09;United States Air Force (United Kingdom Bases);144;As I have previously informed the House, the arrangement for United States Air Force use of bases in this country will continue so long as it is needed in the general interest of world peace and security. The British contribution this year to maintenance costs will be £17,500. Apart from this sum, the maintenance of the bases will be entirely a charge on United States funds. As regards the construction of the bases, this country's direct financial contribution is limited to £22½ million out of an estimated total expenditure of £125 million  spread over the years 1951 to 1955. The question of criminal jurisdiction over United States Service personnel will be dealt with by the Visiting Forces Act when it comes into force. In making our Civil Defence dispositions, we will naturally give special attention to places that are specially liable to atomic attack.

But the general policy of the late Government in rearming in conjunction with the United States and in making strong defence arrangements has played a noticeable and traceable part in the relaxation and diminution of tension which has occurred. I think that they deserve full credit for their action, in which we supported them, and which is being continued subject to the general tendency of events.

Abbeville is in enemy hands and heavy fighting is proceeding around and in Boulogne. It is too early yet to say what the result of this coastal fighting may be; but it evidently carries with it implications of a serious character. Meanwhile, General Weygand, who is in supreme command, is conducting operations involving all the Allied Armies with a view to restoring and reconstituting their combined front.

1940-8-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-8-15;Swinton Committee;270;I propose, with the permission of the House, to take advantage of the Questions of the hon. Members for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) and Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) about the work and composition of the Swinton Committee, to make a few general observations on the subject. I submitted to the House some time ago the view that it was not in the public interest that Questions should be asked and answered about this Committee or other branches of Secret Service work, or about measures to deal with Fifth Column activities. It would be very wrong for a Government to plead the public interest as a reason for avoiding public and Parliamentary criticism and debate, and, personally, I would never do so. I am always anxious to give the House of Commons the utmost possible information, and to welcome debate. Therefore when I said it was not in the public interest that this matter should be  pursued, I hoped that this would have been accepted by all Members of the House. However, I regret to say that a number of Questions have been put on the Paper day after day, quite disregarding the request which the Government made. It would have been possible for the Government, under the powers now accorded, to prevent these Questions from appearing on the Paper, and to prevent all reference to the subject in the newspapers; but I thought it would be much better to leave the putting down of Questions to the good will and sense of responsibility of Members, and I am very sorry that in a few cases this attitude has not been forthcoming.

1940-8-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-8-15;Swinton Committee;90;There would be no conceivable injury to the public interest in these two facts being known. I am entirely indifferent on that subject. But I think that if we are to have the Government cross-questioned about this committee and Secret Service work, and one point after another is brought out, and Members say, "Why did you not tell us that before?" that is a process which would be vitiating the measures of secrecy taken by the Government in this matter, and a right which is claimed by every other Government.

Whether it is convenient or easy for me to answer them or not, I would not think of answering any of them. I have said that it is not in the public interest that private matters of this kind should be ferreted out and discussed in public. I should have thought that, having appealed to the House in this way, the Government might receive that consideration which they are entitled to claim.

A report has been received from Singapore that His Majesty's Ship "Prince of Wales" and His Majesty's Ship "Repulse" have been sunk while carrying out operations against a Japanese attack on Malaya. No details are yet available except those contained in the Japanese official communique, which claims that both ships were sunk by air attack. I may add that on our next Sitting Day I shall take occasion to make a short statement on the general war situation, which has, from many points of view, both favourable and adverse, undergone important changes in the last few days.
1939-9-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1939-9-03;Prime Minister's Announcement;171;When I spoke last night to the House I could not but be aware that in some parts of the House there were doubts and some bewilderment as to whether there had been any weakening, hesitation or vacillation on the part of His Majesty's Government. In the circumstances, I make no reproach, for if I had been in the same position as hon. Members not sitting on this Bench and not in possession of all the information which we have, I should very likely have felt the same. The statement which I have to make this morning will show that there were no grounds for doubt. We were in consultation all day yesterday with the French Government and we felt that the intensified action which the Germans were taking against Poland allowed no delay in making our own position clear. Accordingly, we decided to send to our Ambassador in Berlin instructions which he was to hand at nine o'clock this morning to the German Foreign Secretary and which read as follows: 
1939-9-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-03;Prime Minister's Announcement;151;In this solemn hour it is a consolation to recall and to dwell upon our repeated efforts for peace. All have  been ill-starred, but all have been faithful and sincere. This is of the highest moral value—and not only moral value, but practical value—at the present time, because the wholehearted concurrence of scores of millions of men and women, whose co-operation is indispensable and whose comradeship and brotherhood are indispensable, is the only foundation upon which the trial and tribulation of modern war can be endured and surmounted. This moral conviction alone affords that ever-fresh resilience which renews the strength and energy of people in long, doubtful and dark days. Outside, the storms of war may blow and the lands may be lashed with the fury of its gales, but in our own hearts this Sunday morning there is peace. Our hands may be active, but our consciences are at rest.

In 1924, from February to November, Mr. Fenton; in 1929, May to June, Mr. Normand; 1929–31, Mr. Watson; 1936–37, Mr. Reid; 1941-43, Sir David Murray; 1945–47, Mr. D. P.

I do not consider that this matter can be dealt with satisfactorily by a number of separate answers at Question Time. On the other hand, I must advise the House most seriously that a Debate on this matter would have very great dangers. One tale is good till another is told. His Majesty's Government take great trouble over their conduct of business, and on the whole it may be said that it has been conducted with success. When you look at the advance in Italy and the extraordinary achievements of the cross-Channel landing in France, a fair-minded man would consider that the Administration had a right to the confidence of the House when they said they did not wish a particular subject discussed. This is not because we are not prepared to discuss it in all detail, and if need be in all severity; but the result of such a discussion might well be to emphasise any differences which exist with the French Committee of National Liberation, headed by General de Gaulle. I should be sorry to see these issues prematurely forced to a decision, and, therefore, I ask from the House a measure of leniency and forbearance in their treatment of this matter.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);22;I said that I did not think it would be advisable to answer a number of questions. I remain of that opinion.

I can assure the House that it is not that these matters are not engaging the attention of His Majesty's Government. They are very much indeed. But I am reluctant to bring them to a head at present, and I hope that a better solution will be achieved than would be the case, if there had to be a quite definite threshing out of the matter in the House of Commons. With regard to the financial point, it is rather technical. The President made a statement last night, which is published, I believe, in this morning's papers, but I have not had a chance of reading that statement. I could not commit myself to anything about finance—a statement about which might well be made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer—until we know what it is that the President has said on the subject. It seems to me, however, quite clear that if notes are given out to the French population, in return for livestock and other services, the responsibility for meeting them, in the first instance at any rate, would lie with the Governments issuing them.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);165;I am afraid the hon. Gentleman's question was so long that I have forgotten what was the point of it. I am quite certain that there has been no breach of the financial regulations and rules and practices of the House. In regard to any issue of chits or notes, in foreign countries, that is all covered by the general conditions of the expenditure on the war, and all has to be accounted for to the House in the proper method and at the proper time. As for the general question of whether there is entire agreement throughout the country and in the House, on all the ways in which the different foreign policies, as affecting all the various countries, have been handled, I can assure the House that I have never aimed at so high an ideal, and, when I think of some of the persons who would have to be converted, I am very glad that I never set my aim so high.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);139;I never intended it to be indefinite postponement, but I do not think it would be a good thing to have a Debate in the House now. I am certain it would do more harm that good, and might lead to things being said which afterwards were found to have very serious repercussions, because, if attacks are made, answers will be given, whenever required. Therefore, I still adhere to my request to the House, and my advice to the House—it can only be advice; I am entirely in their hands—that they will not raise this matter at this time. But I assure the House it is my earnest desire to give them the fullest account of all these matters, when that can be done without prejudice to such hopes as remain, in respect of such matters in the future.
1944-6-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-6-14;France And United Nations (Relations);162;I do not at all agree that there is great and widespread anxiety. It certainly deserves careful and unremitting attention, but I think that, if there is great and widespread anxiety in this matter, it will be, and should be, properly directed to our gallant soldiers who are striking down the enemy in France and advancing continually, and to the great operations which are in progress, and which give hope as well as anxiety. It seems to me very lacking in proportion for hon. Members—Would the hon. Member like to say something more? If he does not wish to do so, perhaps he will allow me to finish what I have to say. I say, I think it shows a marked sense of disproportion and I am earnestly  hoping that we shall not be pressed at this time. If I had no hopes of a better solution than I could announce at the present time, I would not0 ask for the delay.

The Russians opened an offensive in January, as Marshal Stalin had said in his message they would, and I am arranging for the further message on this subject which I sent to Marshal Stalin on 16th January, not hitherto published, to be circulated in the OFFICIAL REPORT.

1943-9-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-9-22;Death Of Sir Kingsley Wood;387;I revert to the painful event which was made known yesterday, namely, the sudden death of our Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood. He was a very old Member of the House. He had been here for a quarter of a century. For the last ten years he has been continuously in office amid all the vicissitudes, changes and shocks of that period. Everyone knows how good his work was at the Post Office and the Ministry of Health. He left a mark on the Post Office and made a very great contribution to building up the prestige of the Ministry of Health to the high point it has attained among the great offices of State. Then, before the war, he was taken to a field in which he had not had previous experience. It was thought necessary that his business and administrative efficiency should be applied to our air production and to our Royal Air Force, and he became Air Minister in those critical years. As between the different Services, while avoiding invidious comparisons, I should certainly say that the outlook of the Royal Air Force upon this war was more closely attuned to the circumstances and conditions as they emerged by painful experience than those of either of the other two Services. The great contribution for which Sir Kingsley Wood's  administration of the Air Ministry will always be remembered was the founding and development of the Empire Air Training Scheme in Canada, to which pilots from New Zealand and Australia came in great numbers, to which would-be pilots from the United Kingdom have also been sent in large numbers, and which has produced us a ceaseless flow, numbered by tens of thousands, of those extraordinarily competent and daring men to whom we owe so much of the satisfactory position we have now attained. This Empire Air Training Scheme was a work of great imagination, and all who were concerned in it deserve the greatest possible credit. It was not only a war winner but an Empire cementer. I imagine that the friendships and comradeships formed by these young men in the vast training camps of Canada will carry on their beneficent influence long after the older Members of this House have passed away. That was a very great and outstanding act of his administration.

As indicated, however, in my reply of 15th November, to the hon.

I think it is all to the good that, in the midst of present world affairs, this House should devote a day to the affairs of a small tribe in Africa, and concern itself with the rights of individual citizens. This is a non-party matter and it is a very difficult problem, on which opinions may well differ yet be opinions sincerely held.

This is not a matter in which it has been suggested that there should be a total exile, but, because of the controversies in the tribe, the conclusion was reached that the leading personality should be excluded for a period of years.

By agreement between the three Governments, the nature of these war-time arrangements has not been revealed on grounds of public policy. The position of the United States Administration in many of these matters is now regulated by legislation enacted in the United States since the end of the war, and the war-time arrangements have been modified accordingly.

It certainly would be a very great convenience, and would, I believe, be welcomed by the public, if an electrical record of major statements about the war could be made. This record could be used for subsequent broadcasting, which might be deemed an advantage. In my own case I have been constantly asked to repeat the speech I have delivered in the House over the broadcast later. This  imposes a very heavy strain, and is, moreover, unsatisfactory from the point of view of delivery.
1942-1-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-1-20;House Of Commons Speeches (Electrical Recording);127;The idea is that a record should be made for subsequent use. This would be convenient because of the great difference in time between this country and the United States, Australasia, India, South Africa and so forth. I also have the feeling that in the circumstances of this war, when matters have to be spoken of which intimately affect so many of our Dominions and Allies, there might be advantages in taking this course. But I am entirely in the hands of the House. If they do not feel they can give me this easement on this occasion as an experiment, I shall not take it amiss in any way, and I will do my best over the broadcast that evening to repeat what I have said.

I think the House is quite as competent as any particular group of individuals to consider this matter. I dealt myself very carefully with the question of the records. It would be a matter for decision by the House, under Mr. Speaker's guidance, as to whether anything should be left out or should not be reproduced—for instance, if anything was said which revealed a military secret. This is now removed from the published records, and similar latitude would be provided for in this case. I do not propose to adopt the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion.

1951-6-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-28;Mountview Telephoneexchange;50;On a point of order. Because a Minister has failed in his duty to be in attendance on the House for the  answering of a particular Question, is that any reason why he should have the privilege of giving that answer after the end of Question time on another day?
1951-6-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-28;Mountview Telephoneexchange;47;This was represented to us as the answer to a Question, but, Sir, of course, if the hon.

Gentleman was present when previous Questions were put to the Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and he said that the Prime Minister would answer those Questions also, in addition to Questions Nos. 48 and 49.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;19;I would be delighted to answer any question that comes to me in the ordinary course of Parliamentary business.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;84;I should have notice of questions like that, which raise considerable issues. We are in close touch with the United States on these matters. We have a most sincere desire, which is shared in all parts of the House, to see this obstacle of the prisoners' forcible repatriation removed. That is a matter of honour, but we earnestly hope that it may be overcome. It certainly is very near to being overcome and I think we may hopefully await the further development of events.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;112;I think that the matters of principle have been settled. It is now a question of method. I really do not see why there should not be an  agreement on this and why we should not move forward pretty quickly to larger topics and aspects in Korea. But it does not rest entirely with our side, as it were, in this war that is taking place in Korea. I am sure of this—that if agreement on method cannot be reached now it is not because of any difficulties arising out of the specific issues, but because of extraneous considerations which may be in the minds of those with whom we are arguing.
1953-5-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-5-04;Truce Talks;48;I am sure that we would have a much better chance of getting a satisfactory solution under the conduct of General Harrison, who has been acting in accordance with instructions he received from higher authority, than we should have even if the hon.

1951-11-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-11-22;South Africa (British Protectorates);45;I think that the hon. Member, on reflection, will perhaps agree that when the position has been established for so long a period as 40 years, one should not go out of one's way to take the initiative in making a change in the situation.

May I ask, however, whether we can have an assurance from the Foreign Secretary that, in the interval, having gone to Aqaba, we do not scuttle from it under any threat of mere violence? We would like to have that assurance. May I also ask if the Foreign Secretary will consider whether a British representative to the de facto Government of Israel is not greatly needed to be sent at the present time?

1947-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-04;Blocked Sterling Balances (Negotiations);55;Is it not a fact that the Governor-General of India was notified in the time of the late Government that Great Britain reserved her full rights to present a counter-claim on account of the effective defence of India by all means—land, sea, air and diplomacy—by which the freedom of India from foreign invasion was secured?
1947-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-04;Blocked Sterling Balances (Negotiations);42;Is that point going to be made?

1942-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-6-30;Malaya And Singapore (Information);28;The various papers received from General Wavell as the result of the collection of material which he was directed to make are not suitable for publication in wartime.
1942-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-6-30;Malaya And Singapore (Information);56;I certainly never contemplated being committed to the publication of these documents, which were collected for the instruction and further information of the military authorities, and whether they should be made public  or not could only be decided after they had been seen.

1942-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-6-30;Malaya And Singapore (Information);38;I have addressed myself to the Question on the Paper, and to some extent that answers the Supplementary Question of the hon.

1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;38;The right hon. Gentleman could surely find other things in life to laugh at besides those which do not include himself. Otherwise life might be rather gloomy for him. I was saying—a fanatical intelligentsia obsessed by economic fallacies.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;43;The hon. Member may set himself up as a judge, but I must ask him to take his place in the general assembly of the House and not to assume that his will be the casting vote upon a decision of such moment.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;57;We must also preserve our sense of proportion. It seems difficult to believe that the activities of the small number of Communists in our midst could at the present time inflict upon our defensive effort, or upon our national unity, anything like the injury that will be done to us all by this Act of party sabotage.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;100;We shall, if we should obtain the responsibility and the power in any future which is possible to foresee, repeal the existing Iron and Steel Act,  irrespective of whether the vesting date has occurred or not. We shall then proceed to revive the solution which has been set forth in the Trades Union Congress Report and which is accepted by the Iron and Steel Federation, and we shall set up again the tripartite Board, which has been proved to have worked so well. This would be the policy if we had the power, either before or after another General Election.

1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;25;The right hon. Gentleman's argument seems to have great difficulty, no doubt not through any fault of his own, in distinguishing between truth and falsehood.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;66;I really did not suggest at all that this document abandoned the principle and the aim of nationalisation. On the contrary, if my memory serves me, I read a passage which showed that that was not so. Why I quoted the document was to show the very large measure of agreement which existed in regard to the control of a particular industry through a statutory board.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;5;I did not say that.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;48;Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me to express a hope that he will, before he sits down, return for a few moments to the actual subject of the Motion before the House, and tear himself away from these intriguing electoral calculations in which his soul is buried?
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;8;I have stated what would be our policy.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;4;That depends on tonight.
1950-9-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-19;Iron And Steel Nationalisation;31;I consider that a Government which has not got a majority behind its Parliamentary representation should feel itself considerably limited and restricted in its right to make far-reaching changes of policy.

1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);1;Rubbish.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);3;Failure of administration.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);44;We have had a very interesting Debate. I must say that I preferred the more measured words of the right hon. Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. R. A. Butler) to the rather portentous opening of the  right hon. Member for Bromley (Mr. H. Macmillan).
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);89;I did not think that the content of his speech was quite equal to the manner. This Debate has taken a rather unexpected line. As I understood it, the Debate was to be concerned solely with the incident on the Yangtse. It has tended to turn into rather a desultory Debate on foreign affairs, and it would really have been more appropriate to have someone who had been prepared for making a speech on foreign affairs to answer the last part of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);252;The answer was on the question of Hong Kong, and that has been dealt with. I say it is no wonder that this matter was not pursued, because, when we have met any senior officers, they have always said that this idea is complete nonsense. As a matter of fact, a broadside in "The Times" by a gallant admiral, who was a well-liked Member of this House in the last Parliament, has completely silenced the batteries opposite, and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Crawley) also made that point. The point about air cover, the idea that somehow or other we were going to have an operation of war for the silencing of batteries with aircraft of various sizes, either land-based or from aircraft carriers, up 220 miles of river, has proved to be absolute moonshine. I think it was quite wise of the right hon. Member for Bromley that he turned away from that and dealt with why it was a wise thing or a foolish thing that the "Amethyst" should have gone to Nan king at all. [An HON. MEMBER: "It did not get there."] I said, why it should go there. It is a very elementary point. The point of the right hon. Gentleman was that it ought not to have started to go there. Surely the point just made by an hon. Member is a very simple point; and is it really worth while in a serious Debate to make a childish little point like that?
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);13;I am coming to that. I think the hon. Member is a lawyer.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);24;Then it is no use appealing to him to develop a case in an orderly way. Perhaps he will wait for the next round.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);93;I think it is quite true that she could have remained a greater time. The question was, how long? It was thought wise to take the opportunity, which seemed to be an opportunity, of relieving her, otherwise she might have been tied up a much longer time. It was a matter of judgment. It was not decided, as the right hon. Gentleman can imagine, by a Cabinet decision, or anything of that sort. It was the view taken there. I have no doubt that it is a view as good as anybody's here.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);182;Yes; 7th March, and down on 10th March; and the "Consort" went upon 8th March. The "Cossack" came down on 14th March, and the American vessel towards the end of March. The truce all this time, as I have pointed out, was uncertain. I do not think—and I think everybody there will not agree with the senior Burgess for Oxford University (Sir A. Salter)—that this was a deliberate action. I think it was shown it was not, because the first firing was stopped when they saw what she was. Then it started again. I have no doubt the right hon. Gentleman is right in saying that there was a large number of troops possibly not very well disciplined, and I do not think this was a concerted act at all. There was a danger that it might happen. It equally might have happened when the other vessels were going up. That is really the position, and we take full responsibility; but we also take full responsibility for letting the people who are on the spot act in the circumstances which they know.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);128;The right hon. Gentleman has anticipated the point I was going to make. I said that was being determined. The question of the future representation there, whether by ambassador or consul, is obviously one for consideration. I am not prepared to answer that straight off. Similarly, I cannot answer the right hon. Member for Saffron Walden with a positive statement that I will say here and now that an aircraft carrier will go. I am not accustomed to taking decisions of that kind without consulting very fully with our Service advisers. I do not think that it is wise for anyone to get up in the House and to say that we are going to send this, that and the other, without having a proper and full consultation.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);125;I am afraid that I was out of the Chamber. That is the answer to the main points that have been raised in this Debate. There has been, as I have said, a good deal of tendency to change this into a broad survey of the whole position in the Far East and not only in the Far East but in South-East Asia. The Committee knows that we have been pursuing a policy in South-East Asia. A suggestion was made with regard to Burma, and we have been endeavouring to help Burma. We collaborate with both the Indians and the Pakistanis, and of course in the Far East we are in close touch with our Southern Dominions, and also with the United States of America.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);26;I cannot say more than that consultation is going on with regard to the particular radio that shall be sent out, its strength, and so forth.
1949-5-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-5-05;China (British Policy);26;Plans have been made. Obviously I cannot give the plans in detail, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the fullest plans are being made.

This Treaty was reinforced in various forms by Treaties of 1386, 1643, 1654, 166o, 1661, 1703 and 1815 and in a secret declaration of 1899. In more modern times, the  validity of the old Treaties was recognised in the Treaties of Arbitration concluded with Portugal in 1904 and 1914. Article I of the Treaty of 1373 runs as follows:

1948-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-16;Representation Of The People Bill;30;I really must interrupt the right hon. Gentleman. If it were a general election, would the whole general election be voided because people in all parts of the country listened?

1948-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-16;Representation Of The People Bill;64;I have said that in those years of the war I did not pay much attention to electioneering. Of course, when there was a general election naturally I had to, but not in those years of the war; nor indeed was such great attention concentrated upon them by the Conservative Party who completely ignored many matters which afterwards proved of great importance to them.
1948-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-16;Representation Of The People Bill;136;The right hon. Gentleman has given a paraphrase of what I said, and anyone can see what a trustworthy witness he is by listening to and comparing the grotesque travesty which he has uttered with what I have actually said. It is quite true that I did not accuse the right hon. Gentleman of not having taken an interest in the war. Of course, he did. He took an interest in some other matters, too—very much more, if I may say so, than any man in this House. We had accepted—[HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] There is nothing to answer. [Laughter.] I always notice that the party opposite indulge in laughter which resembles the crackling of thorns under a pot whenever they are confronted with any mental proposition which their intelligence forces them to resent or to reject.

1948-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-16;Representation Of The People Bill;138;I have regained possession of the House. I had resolved to be present tomorrow when the right hon. Gentleman makes his speech, because he himself has on record a number of quite remarkable quotations, which I have seen and which he used at the time, but I do not think it would be wise for him to anticipate, in the course of an interruption, the oration which he is to deliver. I am sure I am very glad, however, to see that he feels the force of the point which I am putting to him. To his colleagues who sit upon the opposite Front Bench, I say that the honour of a great party is involved, and also, I must say, the self-respect of several important Ministers, particularly the Prime Minister and the Lord President of the Council.

Gentleman is challenging me, I must point out that I made no bargain on this matter. The matter was adopted for the Bill which was brought before the last Parliament. No pledge whatever was given on this matter.
1948-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-16;Representation Of The People Bill;35;On the contrary, I shall reiterate. The right hon. Gentleman occupied a certain position in that Government. We accepted the report of the Speaker's Conference as a whole, and he knows that that was so.

I have not been able to listen to any of them but, of course, behind the scenes, in the preparation of this Measure, I have had over the last year continuous opportunities to acquaint myself, as far as possible, with the general flow of opinion on the controversial questions involved. I hope my apology will be accepted, because I thought it right at this moment to suggest a somewhat unexpected course which I think will be found, when it is carefully considered, helpful to our affairs in general, and also to particular matters which we have in hand and to which the House has devoted so much attention and thought. Above all, we need to preserve our sense of proportion. There are all sorts of matters which are extremely important upon which we might expend a great deal of energy and pugnacity, but at present we must keep our pugnacity, as far as possible, for export purposes. It seems to me that the Government would be much to blame if they so handled their public business as to bring about unnecessary, or at any rate premature, schisms and disputes between those who have only one object, namely, our safe and victorious emergence from our horrible struggle with Germany.

We cannot afford to lose this Bill. I think we are all agreed about that, and, therefore, I think we are all agreed that, as far as to-day goes, we can postpone these Clauses, because to plunge in upon them will frustrate the desire to get the Bill and cause trouble. I am quite ready to say that the Government would rather have the Bill, with the Clauses, in a broadly agreed form, than have the Bill go forward and another Bill come along to overtake it. If we have to choose between that and losing the Bill, we would rather have this cumbersome method of the tank being separated from the engine, and the engine having to go back and catch it. We are all agreed what to do this afternoon. So far as I can make out, it is pretty nearly universal. There are the week-end and Monday, and I certainly think that discussions should proceed, through the usual channels and also in the Cabinet, to see whether we can save this Bill and have an agreed compensation Clause.

As I said, the Bill has to go to another place and that may take some time. I am afraid that if it runs to the end of the Session we shall lose the Bill, and I do not want to lose it. What we have said is that we should move to drop the Clauses now. We have control of the Bill for perhaps eight or nine days before it must go upstairs, if it is to go any further. In this period it is my hope that we may reach some agreement which will easily enable these Clauses to be reinstated. If that fails, then the suggestion I made earlier will come into operation.

At any rate I give it my wholehearted support. I agree with the Prime Minister that we cannot easily or lightly add words to those which were spoken yesterday under the promptings and spur of this loss, but it is a very great loss. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Our feelings grow. Not only is it a loss to our country but to millions of people who live in the Middle East, and it is very fitting that the Prime Minister should have moved, and be supported, as I am sure he will be, by the whole House, this Motion recording our grief and our sympathy. I have no doubt that it will carry far and wide throughout the Arab and the Israelite world and to wider regions our feelings of admiration for the great Arab statesman who has gone, and our earnest hope that his memory will be preserved, and his work not found to be in vain.

There have been important changes in the constitutional relations between the various parts of the Commonwealth since the Committee of Imperial Defence was established in 1904; and in the conditions of today other methods of Commonwealth  consultation and co-operation in defence are more effective and appropriate.

It is my duty to offer him and the Government our congratulations upon the successful issue of this difficult and, as at one time it seemed, almost superhuman exercise of the air lift, which has shown a method of solving a deadlock and difficulty far preferable to some others which might have been considered at one time or another. I feel that the firmness which has been shown and the powerful aid and consistent policy of the United States, with whom we have worked hand in hand, have quite appreciably lessened the sense of war tension which has hung over us as each day brought out difficult incidents in Berlin. It is a matter in which we all rejoice, and on this side of the House we are very glad that we never faltered in steady support of the policy of His Majesty's Government and of the Foreign Secretary in the whole of this anxious business. We gladly pay our tribute to them. It only shows how important national unity is in these matters and how desirable it is to exclude party fights as far as possible from these large and important fields.

The present publication is a reprint of the broadcasts which have already appeared in the Press. Lord Halifax was aware of this development. I might add that the varying reproductions in the Press gave a partial impression which the publication corrects, though the publication naturally reaches only a small part of the public who have already heard the broadcasts. In regard to the last part of the Supplementary Question, I think that it was quite proper that publication should be made after the regular formalities had been complied with, although, of  course, it does not express any opinion except that of the very able public servant who was responsible for it.

The extent and the timing of it would perhaps be best discussed through the usual channels. It is our desire to meet the House. In regard to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe (Mr. J. Hynd), I cannot give the details in a statement like this. I think it would be much better to await the debate.

1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;65;The hon.

1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;65;I think that the hon. Member must look a little more closely into this. Apart from what is called the armaments industry, rearmament does cover an immense range of industries—sub-contracting and so on, the engineering industry and the rest. From the point of view of practical politics it is out of the question to nationalise the whole or every part of industry engaged in rearmament.

1951-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-1-29;Economic Implications;106;I should like my hon. Friend to realise the nature of the problem with which we are faced. It is not just the question of getting so many individuals; it is getting people who have had the training, and who fit in, and therefore make a complete unit. A general appeal for recruits would not do that; therefore there is need for this selective call-up. I need hardly say that it is open for volunteers of the Territorial Army, the Regular Army and the other forces to come forward. The more people who volunteer the better, and the less recourse we shall have to the call-up.

These were mainly lascars who had been serving on German ships before the war. Within a short time after their release the ship was attacked by night, and 100 of the passengers and crew were killed. The ship was adequately armed both with high and low angle guns to provide protection against aircraft or submarine  attack, but she was attacked suddenly by an aircraft assumed to be friendly, and therefore her guns were not brought into action.

1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);3;I will continue. 
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);15;I am in possession of the House as long as you permit it, Mr. Speaker.
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);45;We ought to be able to discuss these matters. In view of this perfectly clear paragraph in the King's Regulations, may I ask the right hon.

1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);8;Is this for the Navy or the Army?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);25;I have read a passage which entirely contradicts that and which was taken from the King's Regulations for the Naval Services. Surely that is relevant——
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);13;Surely that is relevant in this matter and what I ask is this——
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);41;What I ask, arising from that, is this: Was permission given by the First Lord of the Admiralty or other Ministerial authority to the First Sea Lord to enter upon this subject in the manner which has been attributed to him?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);24;But is it not very desirable to keep the high naval and military professional authorities, actively serving, out of matters of controversy in Parliament?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);31;Now, with very great respect, I put this question to the Prime Minister. Does he approve of the Minister of Defence deliberately justifying what has been a breach of King's Regulations?

1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);1;What?
1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);1;But——

1951-3-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-14;First Sea Lord (Speech);83;On a point of order. Is it not a very insulting charge for the Minister of Defence to make, that I should have adopted—[Interruption.] Hon. Gentlemen opposite are afraid to hear the case put—a totally different view of King's Regulations, if the First Sea Lord's opinions had been of a very different  nature from those which have been expressed? Is it not very much better that all parties should join together to keep the professional heads of the Services out of political matters?

1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;Boys (Active Service);152;There are just under 5,000 boys under 18 years of age serving at sea, of whom 137 have been casualties. The Navy is a voluntary service and secures a large part of its personnel by the recruitment of continuous service boys between the ages of 15 and 16½. The consent of their parents is obtained before entry. Training at sea is an essential part of a boy's training, and the great majority of these boys go to sea from the age of 17 upwards. There they perform the task appropriate to their age and training and form an essential part of the ship's company. It is not proposed to alter a system which has been the traditional method of providing personnel for the Navy. In future, however, the consent of the parents will be obtained if, in an exceptional case, the boy's training at sea will start below the age of 17.
1939-10-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-25;Boys (Active Service);67;I have considered the matter very carefully. As I say, we have 5,000 boys who are an essential part of the complement of the Fleet at the moment. By making the proposal that, before the age of 17, boys may be prevented from going to sea if their parents so desire, I am making a new departure which adds to some extent to the burdens of manning.

1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);87;As the House is aware, the constitutional position in the Council of Europe is that the Assembly is a purely consultative body, on which representatives of the various member States speak and vote in a personal capacity without in any way committing the Governments of those States, or necessarily reflecting their views. Experience has shown that in an Assembly of this kind, private Members can more appropriately take part than Ministers who will naturally be assumed to be committing their Government to a particular course of action.
1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);19;No, the reason is the reason which I have given. The constitutional position is very different in Continental countries.

1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);53;Is it not a fact that this abstention of ministerial representation on the Consultative Committee is only another example of the steady attempt to vitiate the cause of a united  Europe, unless it is a Socialist united Europe which has been pursued by the right hon. Gentleman during the whole of his tenure?
1951-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-6-13;Council Of Europe (Ministerial Representation);71;The right hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong. The whole basis of representation is that individual members should speak in an individual capacity, and, as the right hon. Gentleman would find out if he was in office, there is an obvious difficulty in having Ministers there owing to the confusion as to whether what is spoken by a Minister is spoken as a member of the Government or in an individual capacity.

May I ask whether the only step necessary to bring about this change and procure a new Ruling from you was that the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman of the Committee made a representation to you? Was that the only basis? Is that so, Sir? Did they both make the representation to you?
1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Standing Committees (Composition);67;With great respect, Sir. This is not a question of advice, but of a Ruling. The entire basis of our discus-  sions in Standing Committees has now been changed—changed by altering one figure to the advantage of the Government. That is a very formidable and serious step to have taken. It is an event to which I have not seen a parallel in 50 years' Parliamentary experience.

1943-10-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-10-13;Coalmining Situation;113;I must apologise to the House for intervening in this Debate—[HON MEMBERS: "No."]—because I have not had the advantage of having been on the bench and of listening to it yesterday. But I have read not only the newspaper reports but the Hansard Report to a very large extent, and I have spent since yesterday a good deal of time discussing the position with various friends and colleagues. I did notice that a request was made that there should be some statement from a War Cabinet Minister, and in deference to that request, I thought perhaps I should say a very few words in order to clarify, so far as possible, the situation.
1943-10-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-13;Coalmining Situation;140;I do not say it would be impossible. It would certainly not be so difficult as it would have been during the blitz, though perhaps the blitz might recommence which would add to the gaiety of the proceedings. But still it would be very harmful to the war effort. Moreover such a policy would probably  be preceded by a break-up of the present Administration and a separation of parties into the regular lines of political battle. I could not be responsible, as at present advised, for undertaking any further great change, and certainly not a permanent great change in the mining industry during the war, because that I think would require to be ratified or preceded by a national mandate. Therefore, we must resist all such proposals, and we must ask for the support of the House in so doing.
1943-10-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-13;Coalmining Situation;185;I earnestly hope that it may be possible to preserve national unity after the war, but I say quite frankly that I should not be at all alarmed for the future of this country if we had to return to party government. We may have to do that. But this I will say—and the House will pardon me, I am sure, for saying it—that whatever bitternesses or differences and party fighting may have to take place among us, each representing our constituencies and our convictions, whatever may take place, things can never be quite the same again. Friendships have been established, ties have been made between the two parties, minglings have taken place, understandings have been established which, without any prejudice to men's public duty, will undoubtedly have a mellowing effect on a great deal of our relations in the future, and for my part I must say that. I feel I owe a great debt to the Labour Party, who were a most stalwart support to me at the time when I first undertook the burdens which I am still being permitted to bear.

Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith), who spoke for the Opposition, into the very wide field which he has traversed, and which at points he has illuminated, it is because I hope that later on in the Session we shall have it discussed in a Debate on the Committee of Imperial Defence, or on the salary of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence. I presume that that is so. I address myself directly to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. It always has been so, but if there is not to be such a Debate—

Gentleman would not, I am sure, wish to confine all requests made to him to the usual channels. Members in the House have a perfect right to put questions and to raise points about Votes to be discussed, and I asked, in a passing remark, whether there would not be the usual opportunity given for a general discussion on the three arms combined. At any rate, it is for that reason, because I expect that such an opportunity will be given, that I do not attempt to follow the speaker from the Opposition Front Bench into the very interesting survey which he has made. But there is one point to which I will certainly refer. He spoke of the number of aeroplane squadrons which in the last War were retained in this country at critical times by the fear of air attack, and the great diminution in our effective air force at the front which was entailed thereby. But that is going to happen in every country and over a far larger sphere than has, I think, been realised. The fact that air attack has spread this vast general alarm throughout the whole area of countries is going to mean that the feature of the next war—and, after all, that is the war that, from a military point of view, we must consider, though certainly the War Office is said to be always preparing for the last war—the feature of the next war will be a very vast diminution in the offensive power at the front, because of the enormous abstraction from the resources of the nations which will be frittered away, or dispersed, or in many cases wasted, over a vast area of home defence, against this attack from the sky.

I found myself in very general agreement with the Prime Minister in the closing part of his address, and am fully able to associate myself with him, for reasons which I will presently venture to dwell upon, in his broad conclusion that the action which has been taken by the United States and endorsed, supported and aided by His Majesty's Government gives, on the whole, the best chance of maintaining the peace of the world.

It was one of those rigmaroles and grimaces produced by the modern bureaucracy into whose hands we have fallen—a kind of vague palimpsest of jargon and officialese, with no breadth, no theme and, above all, no facts.
1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;47;—which have led us to this conclusion. I am explaining why I am going to support the Government, and perhaps find myself in the same Lobby as the hon. Gentleman. If I give way to him, perhaps he will bear that in mind, and mitigate his ferocity.
1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;179;That really is a question which should be addressed to the Front Bench opposite. As I say, I stand here confronted with this proposal to have a National Service Bill. I and my Friends, after careful thought, feel bound to give it loyal support. That does not at all deprive us of the full right to point out how very badly other things have been managed, and how much one is in agreement with the feeling the hon. Gentleman has just expressed. Compulsory military service is not necessarily a problem for a regular standing Army; but the only way of making us a nation of fighting men in time of war is by national service in time of peace. As all our habits in the past have been to live in a peaceful manner, we have entered all our wars unprepared or ill-prepared, and the delay before we are able to place an army in the field at the side of our Allies has been a very serious weakness, not only in the physical but in the moral sphere.
1947-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-31;National Service Bill;157;Certainly. I am much in favour of national service being on a basis of absolute equality. There used to be a period when it was possible to hire substitutes—it was so in the American Civil War—but these practices have long passed away. There is nothing contrary to the principles of democracy. On the contrary, it emphasises the principle of equality of sacrifice, and by mingling all classes together, in common duty and honourable service, it is a favourable agent for diminishing class differences which exist in a free and varied society. It has been defended and practised by all the most advanced democratic countries in Europe since the French Revolution. Reliance for the defence of the soil on national armies rather than on long service professionals, or mercenaries as they were called, was, in the 19th century, at any rate, a strong barrier against reaction in a rapidly changing and, upon the whole, advancing and progressing world.

The Government are in the position of a Government that has to be constantly on the watch all the time. Its Members have to be there. On the other hand, the position of the Opposition is that at any time they can direct an attack. Last night there was a Debate on the Adjournment. I think the Adjournment was taken in order to  give the greatest scope to the Opposition for their speeches rather than taking the Debate on the specific matter of the Consolidated Fund. Towards the end of that Debate it was intimated that there was to be a Division.

Why was it necessary for this measure, this step which you thought was right to be taken yesterday, to be left to a Private Member of the House by invoking this doctrine of saying he would raise the matter on the Adjournment? You surely have the power, not only by the rules of order, but by your own personal appeal to the House; by the power of calling other Business, and, if I may say so, by the respect entertained for the Chair, to do it yourself.

I would like to know—and that this agreement will be maintained, though after a great deal of discussion, with the United States on these cardinal issues? If that is so we are very glad indeed, and we are particularly relieved to feel that no breach between Great  Britain and the United States, even though concerned with a tangle of words, would occur at such a grave juncture in our joint fortunes.

1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);74;Yes, but things have happened since September, and I am, in principle, in favour now of the whole of these demands, subject to their correct examination. I think that is perfectly reasonable. But they are entirely new demands; they are a new version, an afterthought, and a reconsideration of the facts which were long before Parliament and the public, and which simply arise out of requests which I will mention before I sit down.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);105;If I went too far, I should come to that period of complete victory over all our enemies which was at that time thought to be a subject of general rejoicing. But I am not going back so far as that. After the end of the war, on 22nd October, 1945, I urged the Government to speed up their demobilisation plans, which the National Government had made, so that as early as possible in 1946 the Forces should be reduced to definite ceilings pending the work of settling peace-time requirements. I gave the following figures: Army, 1 million; Navy, 150,000; Royal Air Force, 400,000—total, 1,550,000.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);50;I am not arguing with the right hon. Gentleman. [HON. MEMBERS: "Give way."] I have all the afternoon before me in which to unfold the arguments I wish to make, and, consequently, I am not at all restive under interruptions. Any serviceable weapon is better than no weapon at all.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);902;They would have been a great deal better equipped if a wiser process had been followed. The squandering and destruction of what might have been carefully put away in care and maintenance, and thus preserved for use should other trouble come, was a lack of foresight. [Interruption.] I never said anything about the Lord President of the Council, although I have no doubt that he had as much to do with it as anybody else, and much more than his right hon. Friend the Minister of Defence on his right flank. [HON. MEMBERS: "Get on with it."] I shall not be hurried at all; I shall take my time in dealing with every interruption, because I feel I have a perfectly legitimate right to unfold this case in my own way. In the United States, in spite of many temptations, less improvidence was shown, especially in respect to warships. I may remind the House again that the figure for the Services which I mentioned of 1,550,000 is double that to which the Forces were later reduced. And even now, according to the Defence Minister's speech of yesterday, it will not be until 1952 that an overall figure of 900,000 can be reached. I say this because this has been made an accusation against me. I think it was the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs who made that attack the other day. I sent him some  figures correcting it, which he had not the courtesy to acknowledge. I agree that the mistakes made at the beginning put us on the wrong line, but no British Government in time of peace has ever had the powers that Socialist Ministers have wielded, or the resources they have consumed. In 1946, they took the step, with our full support, of introducing National Service in peace-time. First, 18 months was the term, then 12 months, and then 18 months again according to the changing winds. Now it is two years. Before the late General Election, I said to the House that the principle which might help us in economising our money and our manpower, and in getting better value from the sacrifices demanded, would be to take fewer men and to hold them longer. We all know how that was used at the election. Nevertheless, we have supported the Government in their further steps. Undoubtedly, the two years' service was far more suited to our dangers and to our special problems than anything else they proposed before. If it had been introduced in 1947 or 1948, when the skies began to darken—and we should certainly have supported the Government—how much better off we should be in effective military formations today? One has the feeling that if the position had been studied by the Minister of Defence and other Ministers responsible —and they have changed often, not always for the better—very good solutions might have been reached. But the Government deal in words, in declarations, in projects and in schemes which seem to indicate impressive action. Alas, it is mainly on paper—committee to committee, declaration to declaration, one edition after another of their proposals for National Defence. But with the control they have demanded over our manpower, and with the vast sums of money voted so constantly by the House, it ought to have been possible to produce a substantial and efficient Army. I do not say an adequate army, but a substantial and efficient army. But what has happened? With Defence Estimates of nearly £1,000 million a year for five or six years, and with their unprecedented control of manpower, they have produced so few effective tactical units that when the Korean trouble broke out and it was necessary  for us to send a token force—I have never advocated sending more than a token force—to Korea under the authority of the United Nations, it took over three months to produce even a brigade group of good quality. But talk and waste and muddle have robbed the nation of the results of resources which, whether adequate or not, Parliament at their request conferred upon the Government on a very large scale. Another subject of grave complaint is the inability of the Government to produce any atomic bombs of our own in the five and a half years which have passed since the war. When we remember how far we were ahead, and how we were able to deal on equal terms with the United States, it is indeed depressing to feel that we have been outstripped by the Soviets in this field. I take the opportunity of repeating now my request that the document I signed with President Roosevelt in the war should be made public at an early date. We must not forget that by creating the American atomic base in East Anglia we have made ourselves the target, and perhaps the bull's eye of a Soviet attack. On 28th March, last year, I said in Parliament: "If, for instance, the United States had a stock-pile' of 1,000 atomic bombs—I take the figure as an illustration merely; I have no knowledge of any sort of kind of what they have—and Russia had 50, and we got those 50, fearful experiences, far beyond anything we have ever endured, would be our lot."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 28th March, 1950; Vol. 473, c. 201.] I say the total failure of the Government to hold its own and to keep up development—
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);80;The right hon. Gentleman really ought not to mislead the country on a matter like this. He knows perfectly well it was by his agreement, and the agreement of the Government of which I was a Member, that the development of the atomic bomb and the making and everything took place across the other side of the Atlantic, and it is utterly untrue to suggest there has been a failure to develop it here. It is entirely wrong of him.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);73;At the end of the war we resumed full freedom to make the atomic bomb ourselves. The only reason we did not make it during the war was  that we were under air bombardment. We had not got a safe place here and the United States therefore had the facility and the credit of making it. At the end of the war we were perfectly free to resume manufacture. Is not that correct?
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);19;Certainly, I have answered "Yes." I am sorry if the right hon. Gentleman cannot hear me. I said "Yes."
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);27;Then what is the complaint about what I have said, that in the five and a half years no success has rewarded our efforts in making it?
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);52;The right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong. There has been successful development. He is not producing any evidence whatever to show that, given the resources and possibilities over here as compared with the resources they have in the United States of America, we could have done more than we have done now.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);47;What is the meaning of that interruption? I say we have not succeeded in making the atomic bomb completely in this country in the five and a half years since the war. Does anybody challenge that? [Interruption.] All right, find something to cheer at if you can.
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);68;If I were wrong, the Government would readily correct me. If I am right it is more important for people to know the facts than it is for the Russians, who are constantly doing their utmost. And after all, we have of course the aid of the United States to look to in the matter, which I quite agree is incomparably greater than anything we could have done.

Member that, if he is calculating on divisions inside our party he is making a calculation which is as woefully inaccurate as most of those of his leaders  have been about this great question of military policy. Since the Minister of Defence was so haughty, I will quote what I said on 27th July last: 
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);78;It is undoubted that in my long life I have used the word "doubled." The only additions to the new construction announced last March are 41 new minesweepers and some small craft. Is that sufficient, when we con-  sider the enormous increase both in output and in numbers with which we should be confronted in Russian U-boats over those of the Germans, which, at the outset of the war, were such a very great immediate pre-occupation to us?
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);60;Let me return to the "Manchester Guardian"—I choose this paper because it does not belong either to the Labour or to the Conservative Parties. It belongs to a middle party—a party which, in this matter, takes an impartial view. [An HON. MEMBER: "So did the right hon. Gentleman once upon a time."] In an article today the "Manchester Guardian" states: 
1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);43;What I have just read is not what I said, though I agree with it.

1951-2-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-15;Defence (Government Policy);63;I certainly do not feel called upon to propose an alternative time so that hon. Members opposite may go round from door to door trying to make political capital out of it, but if the Government had proposed a longer period of training we would certainly have supported them, and if we were responsible we would face our obligations, as is our duty.

With regard to the 135 Members who have put down their names on this question, nothing would be easier and, if I were so base, nothing more tempting, than to offer large and unconsidered concessions at the public expense.

1945-4-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-4-10;Women's Land Army;8;I do not remember using the word "guarantees."
1945-4-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-4-10;Women's Land Army;102;Certainly I cannot at the moment, but the principle of division is that the Women's Land Army fall into the general industrial sphere. That is the position we have taken up. We may be wrong, but we have taken it up. One hundred Members have put down their names to a statement that we are wrong, but probably we have a majority which thinks we are right. I do not know. But naturally the future is a separate topic from the past. In the future, if women are needed on the land the necessary attraction must be offered to secure their supply.

1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;114;I desire to take up the time of the House for only a very little while this afternoon, and only to touch upon two points. The first one concerns my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, but I understand that he has public duties which make it difficult for him to attend the Chamber this afternoon, and I will therefore make my point to the Under-Secre-  tary of State and to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and rely upon their good offices to convey anything they may think of the slightest interest or value to their colleague. Last Tuesday night the right hon. Gentleman made the following statement: 
1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;41;No, but I would submit that, after all, many Members can testify from their own personal experience that even on the exceedingly high standard required, there is no reason for any anxiety, and certainly no ground for founding a general aspersion.
1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;21;I read Lord Baldwin's further statement, which was equally effective and equally strong, and was exclusively based upon first-line air strength.

1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;9;That all relevant facts will be taken into consideration.
1938-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-21;Air Supplementary Estimate, 1937;130;I am speaking now of the spring of 1935. At that time, when this story of first-line aircraft was brought up, we were told how much better our machines would be because we had started late and we should have the advantage, and how much larger our reserves would be. All that was in relation to the machines for the 31st March, 1937. I cannot charge my memory with the debates, but I will make a search of them. I have, however, little doubt that the impression left upon the House was, and it was intended to be left upon the House, that by 31st March, 1937, we should have an Air Force of 1,500 first-line strength, equipped with good modern machines. That was the idea. That was the plan.
1951-2-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-12;Divisions (Points Of Order);51;May I venture to ask you, Mr. Speaker, in view of all we have heard—which we were not aware was to be raised—whether you do not feel it entirely within your rights to take time to consider what your answer may be and to ascertain some opinions from other hon. Members?
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;97;I would like to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of that statement which you have read to us, Mr. Speaker, which shows that the Committee of Privileges were misinformed and that this House has been misled, so that it has passed a Resolution which has been interpreted as laying blame on entirely innocent persons, it is not undesirable that that should remain on the records of this House; and whether the Prime Minister will not move that the Resolution of the House be rescinded, and the matter again inquired into by the Committee of Privileges?
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;178;The Leader of the Opposition was good enough to give me notice that he intended to put the question which the House has heard, so I have had a brief opportunity of considering the subject. The conclusion I arrived at is the same as that suggested by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair), that, on the whole, it would be better to leave the matter, as you suggest, Sir, where it is, because it is established, so far as this House is concerned, that a breach of Privilege was committed, and it is established that that breach of Privilege was in the summoning of the hon. Member in the circumstances detailed in the Report of the Committee of Privileges. It does not really make any difference so far as the House is concerned who summoned him; the breach of Privilege has been established, whoever summoned him. As the right hon. Gentleman the Member for  Caithness and Sutherland has reminded us, this matter is still under the consideration of the Select Committee——
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;40;This point is very important. My right hon. Friend says that this Privilege matter is now under the consideration of the Select Committee. How can that be, seeing that the Select Committee was set up anterior to this incident occurring?
1938-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-18;Mr Speaker's Ruling;180;Perhaps it was not explicit enough when I said that this was under the consideration of the Select Committee. I did not mean that the question of Privilege was under the Select Committee, but I meant the whole story, and, in particular, the actions of the Ministers concerned. The House has had to spend a good deal of time over this, and it is desirable that we should not give the country the impression that we are spending too much time. If it be the case, as you have suggested, Sir—and I think it is the case—that there is no reflection upon anybody concerned with the summoning, I do not think there is any particular object in sending it back to the Committee of Privileges. I think the House will agree when I say it would be unwise to put down another Motion to rescind the report of the Committee which has already been presented to us and debated by the House. It would mean that the matter would have to be referred to the Committee of Privileges once again.

1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);66;I think that probably it will be realised that it is a little early for me to give a definite reply at the moment. I should like to look into that very carefully. The matter should be discussed through the usual channels  to see just how things are going and how this matter can be arranged most conveniently for the House, and in the public interest.
1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);67;I do not wish to press the Government at all on the immediate or actual date.

1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);48;I do not want to tie myself down to a specific date at the moment.

1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);19;It is a little more than the usual channels, because we are bringing the Prime Minister into it himself.

1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);26;I will consider that. I understand that the full text has been published, but I will consider whether it is useful to lay a White Paper.
1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);51;With great respect, we feel very strongly that we should have the text before us. Of course, if it has been published in the newspapers we do not wish to press for the expense of printing a White Paper; but are we to have the full text before us or not?
1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);77;Yes, certainly, but this is a question of considering whether a statement which has, I understand, been put out very fully in the public Press, is necessarily to be circulated as a White Paper before it has been considered whether or not any comments, and the rest, should be put out with it. Sometimes, it may be a waste of time. I will certainly consider in what way we can assist the House best in this matter.
1950-5-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-5-11;Coal And Steel Production (Integration Proposals);66;With very great respect, we are entitled to the text. We are entitled to see what has been said. I really ask the Prime Minister to make sure that we get the text.

One is  risking a great deal of life in a practically unarmoured vessel, because one is moving from the class which hunts the submarines into the class which it is worth while for the submarines to hunt. It is easy to see the desire to say each year they are better than the year before, but one is passing out of the effective sphere of destroyer utility.

I never suggested they would be ready at the outbreak of war, but when other great ships are sunk, it is then that the older ones come into play with advantage. It may well be they would not come in until the second year of the war. [Interruption.] Why these cries of "Ooh, ooh"? Hon. Members should learn to follow reasonable arguments on these matters. Material reserves are not necessarily ready at the outbreak of war—it may be only a year after, or two years after, that they come in, but it may be vital then to have something when you have lost the others.

1949-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-28;Sterling Exchange Rate;1251;—a substantial relief in taxation—[HON. MEMBERS: "On what?"]—The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not say there should never be any reduction in expenditure. Hon. Members should ask him on what. He has the power to answer the question, and the duty to answer the question—[An HON. MEMBER: "It is your duty too."]—I am as good a judge of my duty as the hon. Member is of his. I say that a reduction in expenditure, a substantial relief in taxation applied to increase incentives to production and earnings, especially among the wage-earners liable to direct taxation, widespread relaxation of needless and vexatious controls and interferences with the flexibility of private enterprise, the definite lifting of the shadow of further nationalisation from our most active and prosperous industries and, above all, the return to power of a Government commanding national and international confidence—all these would have created and may still create conditions in which the liberation of the pound sterling would have a good chance of opening wide doors of prosperity into the future. But by one means or another devaluation or liberation, if this step were inevitable, should have been taken as part of a general scheme of financial reform  instead of being plunged into as an isolated act forced upon us at the last moment. Again and again the Chancellor was warned from this side of the House and by financial authorities outside that he was living in a fool's paradise. But all these warnings were in vain. I think he made some remark about "Dismal Desmonds." Was that his phrase or did one of his colleagues achieve this alliterative gem? Therefore, whatever may be thought of the relative advantages or disadvantages of devaluing or liberating the pound sterling, the timing of the step was obviously wrong. A drastic alteration in the exchange rate, if proved necessary, should not have been left till the crisis broke upon us but should have been taken in anticipation of it. It is not easy to palliate the right hon. and learned Gentleman's blunder. We all know the abilities of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In his position he had more and better information on the subject at his disposal than anyone else in the world. He ought, surely, to have exercised foresight and decision in good time before our remaining gold reserves had been drained away and he was forced higgledy-piggledy into action which we know he loathed, under the worst possible circumstances. I am sorry not to see the Lord President of the Council in his place because I wish to quote with great approval some remarks which he has made on this subject: "The real problem of statesmanship …" said the Lord President of the Council in June, 1946— "in the field of industry and economics is to see trouble coming and to prevent ourselves getting into the smash. We are determined that we are not going to be caught unawares by blind economic forces under this Administration." But that is exactly what has happened to his colleague the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He could not possibly have described it in more precise or harmonious language. In fact, it has almost a prophetic aspect about it. I come to another point. The question is much discussed in the country of the Chancellor's political honesty. Ordinary people find it difficult to understand how a Minister, with all his knowledge and  reputation for integrity, should have felt it right to turn completely round, like a squirrel in its cage, abandon his former convictions and do what he repeatedly said he would never do, and moreover, enforce upon his party and his most faithful followers the humiliating tergiversation which we have witnessed. I am surprised, I must say, that the Chancellor's own self-respect did not make him feel that, however honest and necessary was his change of view, his was not the hand that should carry forward the opposite policy. Certainly he stands woefully weakened in reputation, first by his lack of foresight, and secondly, by having had completely to reverse the reasoned convictions with which he made us familiar. Of course, we know that changes in currency cannot be announced beforehand. The secret had to be kept. It was certainly very well kept, perhaps too well kept considering the position of some of our friendly countries like France. But we congratulate the Chancellor—and he will agree with this—and the Foreign Secretary on the high art which they displayed in the necessary process of deception. The histrionic quality of their performance was indeed remarkable. But I am not speaking of the last month but of the position three and four months ago. I have been shown nine quotations from the Chancellor's speeches declaring himself the inveterate opponent of devaluation. It is very important that our Chancellor of the Exchequer should have foresight. It is also desirable that he should have consistency, as far as possible. It is important that Parliament and the country should believe that when he speaks at that Box opposite he means what he says. Otherwise, how can people attach the weight to his declarations and pledges without which a Chancellor of the Exchequer is grievously crippled? How he of all men could adopt the policy, "What I tell you nine times is untrue," is most astonishing. Although his personal honour and private character are in no wise to be impugned, it will be impossible in the future for anyone to believe or accept with confidence any statements which he may make as Chancellor of the Exchequer from that Box. He stands convicted of lamentable lack of foresight. His usefulness, for all his abilities in the great office  he holds, has been definitely impaired, and I find it most difficult to believe that he would have been content to stay in office if he had thought the ordeal was likely to be a long one. It is odd that the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his present weak and vulnerable position should feel entitled to judge his predecessors with so much severity and to impute wrong and unworthy motives to them. The right hon. and learned Gentleman referred yesterday to my action in returning to the Gold Standard a quarter of a century ago. He said that his policy today was a substitution for the alternative policy of severe deflation. "That policy"— I quote his words from HANSARD— "was pursued at one time under the aegis of the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and depended for its efficacy upon a massive extension of unemployment, with the accompanying lowering of wage rates and so the impoverishment of the employed and unemployed."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th September, 1949; Vol. 468, c. 25.] There were loud cheers from hon. Gentlemen opposite. This was a very aggressive and I may even say offensive reference to past history. To suggest that people would like to see other people unemployed is I think deserving—[Interruption.] I will pick my epithets with care, and I have a large collection of them—is I think deserving of the word "offensive." I think that the whole passage in which he referred to me is singularly out of keeping with the governess and sermon-like passages of some other parts of his discourse. I must say that I am obliged to him for making his accusations here, where they can be answered, instead of circulating them, as is no doubt being done far and wide at this present moment by his party propaganda machine.
1949-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-28;Sterling Exchange Rate;36;The hon. Gentleman is very talkative. One of the strongest claims that the party opposite have is that with their great majority they have never hampered free speech, however detrimental they might find it to themselves.
1949-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-28;Sterling Exchange Rate;23;Would the right hon. Gentleman give us at the same time the figures in relation to the changed purchasing power of the pound?
1949-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-28;Sterling Exchange Rate;34;I knew Lancashire long before the right hon. Gentleman. I never suggested anything of the kind, but it is misleading to state the figures and to compare them without giving the changed purchasing power.

1949-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-28;Sterling Exchange Rate;22;The right hon. Gentleman is no doubt referring to the general strike, but I thought his party were rather ashamed of that.
1955-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1955-3-29;Nuclear Radiation (Medical Aspects);71;The Government have already invited the Medical Research Council to review the existing scientific information on the medical aspects of nuclear radiation and to prepare a report. The report will cover the medical aspects of nuclear radiation, including the genetic aspects. It will review existing scientific information and set forth the most up to date information and the latest research results available. The report will be laid as a White Paper.
1955-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-3-29;Nuclear Radiation (Medical Aspects);31;I think I can say straight away that among other material which we shall place before the Council will be a copy of the HANSARD containing a Question of this character.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;60;Will the right hon. Gentleman say a word on the question of the defence of these various areas? What is to be the method of defence of the Jewish State and of the Arab State, and what are to be the obligations of this country in preventing armed clashes between the two? We should like to hear something about that.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;9;Cannot any hon. Member raise a point of Order?
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;147;I should like for one moment to make my apology to the House and to say that whatever has happened is entirely my fault, because with a singular lack of that precipitancy for which I have of ten been blamed, I did not notice the point upon which my hon. Friend finished his speech. I thought there were two or three more words in his sentence, and therefore I did not immediately jump up. I will gladly give way to any hon. Member, but I do not think that it has ever  been the rule that the first person who gets up is the person to be called. [Interruption.] The hon. Member who has just sat down is clearly a strong partisan of the Arab point of view. He has told us how he has served in the field with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster—
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;265;I misunderstood the hon. Member, but, at any rate, he is well acquainted with the Arab problems and speaks with a strong feeling for their point of view. I do not consider that we are altogether in a free and easy position in this House in regard to this question. Pledges have been given on both sides. The pledge which all the world regarded with considerable attention, and which was mentioned by the Secretary of State in his speech, is undoubtedly the Balfour Declaration of policy put forward by the War Cabinet in the crisis of the Great War. It is a delusion to suppose that this was a mere act of crusading enthusiasm or quixotic philanthropy. On the contrary, it was a measure taken, as the right hon. Gentleman who led us in the crisis of the War knows, in the dire need of the War with the object of promoting the general victory of the Allies, for which we expected and received valuable and important assistance. We cannot brush that aside and start afresh as though it had never been given, and deal with this matter as if we had no obligations or responsibility. Therefore, I am bound to say that upon this issue, having studied the question as far as I can and having some personal connection and responsibility for it, I should have preferred the Government to have persevered in the old policy of persuading one side to concede and the other to forbear, and to carry forward that policy, hard and heavy though it may be, with all its inconveniences.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;20;My intention was to draw a distinction between approving of the policy and approving of further inquiries into the policy.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;109;I suggest that the position is this. What is before the House is the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend. The right hon. Gentleman, in speaking to that Amendment, indicated that he was proposing to move an Amendment to the Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Mr. T. Williams) has explained that, as far as we are concerned, the proposed Amendment to the Amendment will not meet our position at all and that, therefore, we are persisting in our Amendment and intend to take it to a vote. Therefore, in my submission the Debate should continue on the Amendment which we wish the House to adopt.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;7;The Noble Lord is ignoring past history.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;31;I beg to move, as an Amendment to the proposed Amendment, in line 1, to leave out from the word "proposals" to the end of the proposed Amendment, and to add: 
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;26;For the convenience of the House and with the wish of the House, I should be perfectly ready to move my Amendment in this revised form.
1937-7-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-21;Palestine;189;What the right hon. Gentleman said went very far to meet the difficulty which many of us have felt. Our objection to the Amendment as put forward by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) had relation to the question of binding this House to a decision here and now to accept partition; this is putting it shortly. Our intention was to accept the general policy; we did not want this House, when it came back, to be met with a Govern-  ment saying: "You sent us off with a Mandate to the Commission and tied us down to the acceptance of partition." Our point has been not in any way to try to get a party vote on this subject. We are solely concerned with having the best possible way of meeting this position in the interests of the Arab people, the Jewish people and the whole world. If this House is not tied at this moment to acceptance of the principle of the White Paper, the Government are, of course, free to take action. That is a way I think this House will want.
1949-2-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-2-03;Ministers And Public Servants (Official Conduct);4;I beg to move, 
1949-2-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-2-03;Ministers And Public Servants (Official Conduct);36;I think the right hon. Gentleman has confused two things. One thing I said was that I propose to give guidance in a certain matter; the other was a question of an inquiry by a committee.
1949-2-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-2-03;Ministers And Public Servants (Official Conduct);129;Yes, a committee to inquire into contact men. In addition there was a question of some change in the rules affecting entry of strangers and others into this House, and hospitalities which are shared or given here. We on this side of the House have not noticed the need for such changes, and it is very difficult to change the freedom which has been indulged in by Members of all parties in the House of Commons. If it is abused, this is the kind of occasion which cleanses that abuse and makes it very unlikely that it will continue. If at times persons outside the House have come in as guests and paid for refreshments and so forth, all this will undoubtedly be stiffened up by what has occurred.

1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;53;Will the right hon. Gentleman lay before the House the reasons for the termination of the appointment of Viscount Wavell at this particular moment? Will he indicate to us, as it is essential to our comprehension of the position, what differences, divergences or disagreements have arisen between the Viceroy and His Majesty's Government?
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;28;No, Sir. I have made the announcement with regard to the termination of the Viceroyalty of Lord Wavell, and I do not propose to add anything to it.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;76;Surely, we are entitled to be treated in a reasonable manner. Is it not a fact that if Lord Wavell's Viceroyalty had ended with the war, it, would have ended 18 months ago, and that had it ended after three years, it would have ended in June last? What, then, is the reason for this difference and disagreement which have lead to the removal and dismissal of a Viceroy in the full conduct of Government policy?
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;52;The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that Lord Wavell was not appointed for a fixed term. As has been stated, it was thought that in the changing phase of the Indian problem, it was a suitable time to make a change. I do not propose to add anything to that statement.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;51;May I ask, in all humility, because the House is entitled to a reasonable explanation, why has this moment been chosen for this momentous new departure? There must be some reason. Is there any reason why it should be concealed from the House? Why should we not be told the truth?
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;72;I have already stated the reason—[HON. MEMBERS: "What reason?"] Will hon. Members wait a moment. I have already stated the reason in the statement I have made, that we regard it as a suitable time to make a change, owing to the change in the  phase of the Indian problem. I do not intend to say more than that. I am not aware that there is any precedent for such a request.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;58;What are the reasons which make this time appropriate for a change? There must be some reason. Surely, the right hon. Gentleman did not wake up one morning, and say, "Oh, let us get another Viceroy"? It must have some purpose or reason behind it, and we have a right to know what is that purpose or reason.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;38;The Government are perfectly willing to have a Debate and indeed will welcome the opportunity for full Debate on all these matters. I understood that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) asked a question?
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;35;I did ask that some reason or explanation should be given for the extremely important executive action which the Government have taken, and which must have been animated by some motive accessible to human intelligence.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;39;When the right hon. Gentleman was Prime Minister he made a great many changes in both military arid civil appointments. I never understood that there was any obligation on him to give an explanation why those changes were made.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;84;May I ask this question? Here we are dealing with a great policy which is unfolding before us. Are we not dealing with an officer who has been serving the Government in the most intimate relations? Now he is dismissed. May we not know what are the differences  which have arisen to lead to the dismissal of one Viceroy and the appointment of another? Surely that is a matter which, in the history of either House of Parliament, has never been denied fair discussion.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;56;The right hon. Gentleman is quite right about the uncertainties, and one of the reasons for this statement is to try to remove uncertainty. It is a fact that despite all the declarations we have made, there are still people in India who think they can hang on and let things drift. We are against drift.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;14;We want to bring this uncertainty to a close, in regard to this matter.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;35;That is the reason why we put in a date. I think that the matter raised by the right hon. Gentleman would be far better developed in a Debate rather than by question and answer.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;70;No. I have made it perfectly plain that it has been our constant endeavour to have settled government in India. We shall not obtain that by long continued uncertainty, and as it is the policy of this Government and I think of this House that the Indians should become responsible, I think it is time for them to face up to the fact that that responsibility is now upon them.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;58;It is not the intention to hand India over to chaos. I really think that the points which are now being made would be much better developed in a Debate. They are perfectly legitimate points for which we have a full answer. It does not clarify the matter to try. o deal with it by question and answer.
1947-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-10;Change Of Viceroy;26;Is there no answer to be given to the question of whether there have been any differences or divergences between His Majesty's Government and the Viceroy?

1945-8-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-8-21;Strength;27;Yes, Sir, I entirely agree and I will endeavour to get the figures published as soon as possible. The matter is now being considered by the authorities.

As the Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy-Speaker is appointed on the nomination of the Government, the House may perhaps consider it appropriate for me to make a statement on this subject. In order that "the Chair should not only be impartial but should also give the appearance of impartiality"—I quote from the Report of the Select Committee—the Government feel that both the Chairman and the Deputy-Chairman should in future refrain from acting in a professional capacity on behalf of or against Members of the House of Commons. I have consulted Mr. Speaker, the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy-Chairman about this proposed new rule, and I am glad to say that they concur in it.

1953-11-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-16;National Service (Duration);53;No, not at all. What I said was that this was not the time even to toy with the idea of change.

I was not aware of any decisive change that had been contemplated at all in this respect, though I should by no means bind myself always to follow out strictly and faithfully all the actions and policies proposed by the party opposite.

Gentleman realise that so far from there being any intention of making mischief, it is essential that the position of the Government should be made quite clear in view of the critical position of the fight against Communism in Malaya and the need for uniting all communities behind the Government, and that no statement casting doubt on the general line of policy, which, I thought, has been accepted in this House, should issue from this House? What my right hon. Friend was asking was that we may be quite clear that our purpose in defending Malaya against Communism is to help them on the road to self-government.

We have as yet received no official information which fixes the authorship of the crime or gives us a clue to its motives. The murderers themselves narrowly escaped lynching at the hands of Egyptian passers-by, and the Egyptian Government have stated that they were not Egyptian subjects. Very searching inquiries will be made into the origins and associations of these strangers to Egypt, and the House will doubtless require the fullest information as soon as it has been obtained.

I certainly think that every effort should be made to inform the Member concerned that a certain document is to be brought forward.
1954-2-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-11;Departmental Documents (Disclosure);146;We have discussed that matter in relation to the actual occurrence. As I said, we were accused of what is a very grave offence—the shameful betrayal of the vital interests of the British soldier. In those circumstances, it certainly was interesting to see that in the past this matter had been discussed on very even conditions without any of these formidable accusations being associated with it in any way. But, as I have said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War tells me that he wished he had had the time and the opportunity to draw the attention of the right hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) to it. Certainly, it would have been advantageous because he might have persuaded his neighbour, the hon. Member for Aston (Mr. Wyatt) not to cast the Motion in such a deeply dyed depth of villainy.

1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;46;In view of the opinion which you, Sir, have just expressed that my hon. Friend has made out a prima facie case, I think the proper way to handle this matter would be to refer it to the Commitee of Privileges. Therefore, I beg to move: 
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;272;This matter has arisen very suddenly, and is a matter, I think, of very grave concern to every Member of this House. The Prime Minister has moved that it be sent to the Committee of Privileges, but this seems to me to be a very unusual case of breach of privilege. It appears, prima facie, to be an affront to this House. This House has taken cognisance of certain incidents, and there is on the Order Paper a Motion to set up a Select Committee to deal with the matter. I understand that notice has been given that the Prime Minister himself will move that a Select Committee shall be set up to consider this matter. We now find that, under a Department of the Government, a tribunal has been set up to inquire into these very same matters, and that a Member of the House has been summoned, as an officer, to appear before it. It seems rather strange that this should be done under the authority of the Government, when the matter is to be considered by a Committee of Privileges set up by this House to protect the privileges of the House. The  very people who are the subject of inquiry in a cognate matter out of which this has arisen have taken the responsibility for setting up this tribunal, an action which seems to be in conflict with the authority of this House and its privileges. That seems to me to raise a difficult question. I do not know whether the Prime Minister will have anything to say with regard to the position of the Committee of Privileges.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;125;There seems to be some misunderstanding, or some attempt on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to raise some side issue. [Interruption.] I will put it in this way, that the Leader of the Opposition appears to think that the proceedings of this Court of Inquiry are somehow connected directly with instructions given to it by the Government. If so, that is a misunderstanding. I assume that for the setting up of the Court of Inquiry the Secretary of State for War is technically responsible, but in a case of this kind, where there has been divulgence of information which is alleged to be a breach of the Official Secrets Act, it would be an automatic proceeding to set up a Court of Inquiry.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;33;Once the court has been set up, the proceedings do not come under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State himself, still less of the Government. They are carried on by the court.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;201;I rise to support the Motion which the Prime Minister has made, and to thank him for having made it. On the last occasion when a Privilege issue was raised in this House, it was left to the Member who raised it himself to make the Motion, but the Prime Minister, at a later stage in the proceedings, expressed his formal concurrence with the Motion. The right hon. Gentleman, in taking this action himself, has certainly acted in accordance with the high traditions of the House. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has himself made this Motion, and that the matter is to be very strenuously tested in debate, I should like to ask him and the House about two points which arise directly out of the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys) is under military orders to attend  this Court of Inquiry to-morrow, and I presume that the fact that this matter is now to be referred to the Committee of Privileges means that the Government will immediately cancel this order, or that otherwise the House and you, Mr. Speaker, will see that Privilege protects the hon. Gentleman in not complying with it.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;125;I do not propose to follow the hon. Gentleman opposite in discussing a question which, I take it, will be before the Committee of Privileges. With regard to what the hon. Baronet the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) has said, there again I think he is under some misunderstanding. A Court of Inquiry set up by the Army Council is not an inquiry into any charges against my hon. Friend the Member for Nonvood (Mr. Sandys). It is to inquire into charges made against another officer who may have divulged secret information. I cannot see that there is anything indecent in the Army Council having set up an inquiry which in the ordinary course would go into a charge of that kind.
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;27;Was that disclosure of secret information based on the statement made by the hon. Member for Norwood? Is that the reason for the summoning of the inquiry?
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;52;Is it not obvious that the inquiry at the War Office is inquiring into precisely the same question as this House is to inquire into, and that they are seeking to obtain through another channel the information which was attempted to be extracted by other methods from the hon. Member for Norwood?
1938-6-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-29;Question Of Privilege;108;I understand the Secretary of State to say that, of course, he takes full responsibility for the decision of the Army Council, although he was not himself able to attend this particular meeting. May I ask my right hon. Friend whether he did not apprise the military members of the Army Council of the Motion which had been placed, or was about to be placed, on the Order Paper of the House by the Prime Minister, opening up an inquiry by a Select Committee into these or connected matters? If he did not, it seems to me that he placed his military men in rather a hard position.

Which other Minister, except the Prime Minister, has an equal responsibility for deciding upon these particular matters? Which other Minister? I think the Prime Minister might say something on this.
1949-1-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-1-19;Middle East (Raf Reconnaissance Flights);74;The right hon.

1939-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1939-11-08;The War At Sea;271;It is now established that the "Royal Oak" was sunk in the early hours of 14th October by a German U-boat which penetrated the defences of the land-locked anchorage of Scapa Flow. These defences were of two kinds. First, the physical obstructions by nets, booms and blockships; and secondly, by small patrolling craft upon the approaches to the various entrances or Sounds, which are seven in number. Neither the physical obstructions nor the patrolling craft were in that state of strength and efficiency required to make the anchorage absolutely proof, as it should have been, against the attack of a U-boat on the surface or half-submerged at high water. Measures had been taken, and were being taken, to improve the physical obstructions, and the last blockship required reached Scapa Flow only on the day after the disaster had occurred. All the more was it necessary, while these defences were incomplete, that the patrolling craft should have been particularly numerous. But from a variety of causes, connected with the movements of the Fleet, which was not at that time using the anchorage, these patrolling craft were reduced below what was required. I am unable to enter into details, because a full explanation—and no explanation is worth giving unless it is full—would reveal to the enemy matters which would throw a light upon our methods of defence. This light would illuminate for them not only the past but the future. It would not be right to discuss in public, in time of war, these intimate matters of naval defence, and I ask the House with confidence to support the Admiralty in their decision.
1939-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-11-08;The War At Sea;352;During this opening phase of the war the Royal Navy has suffered a greater loss of life than all the other forces, French and British, on sea, on land and in the air combined. Every loss inflicted on us by the enemy has been at once announced. In addition,  since the outbreak of war one of our submarines. His Majesty's Ship "Oxley," has been destroyed by an accidental explosion in circumstances which made its publication inadvisable at the time. So far the "Royal Oak," Courageous "and" Oxley "are the only losses we have had of His Majesty's ships of war, but they are, of course, serious losses. The war at sea has, in fact, been the only war which has been proceeding on a full scale, but the House will not suppose that the losses are the only events which have been taking place at sea. What I told the House under much reserve six weeks ago, I can now repeat with more assurance, namely, that we are gaining a definite mastery over the U-boat attack. In the second four weeks of war the British tonnage lost by enemy action—72,000 tons—was less than half the amount lost during the first four weeks; and against the loss we may set 52,000 tons captured from the enemy, 27,000 tons purchased from foreigners, and 57,000 tons of new built ships, leaving in these four weeks a net gain of 64,000 tons. During the first eight weeks of war our net loss of tonnage has been less than one-third of 1 per cent. This takes no account of the important chartering operations from neutrals which are in progress. It is interesting to note that one of the most valuable of recent prizes was captured from the enemy by the "Ark Royal," which the German wireless has sunk so many times. When I recall the absurd claims which they are accustomed to shout around the world, I cannot resist saying we should be quite content to engage the entire German Navy, using only the vessels which at one time or another they have declared they have destroyed.

Would he not be wise to disabuse his mind of the possibility of this occasion and the manner in which it has been handled bringing him any large measure of compliments and congratulations from  the country as a whole? Has it not given the greatest advertisement to those whom he describes with so much just severity and has it not exposed us to a very great deal of inconvenience and laid us open to much abuse? I personally am not attacking in any way the hostility of the right hon.

[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Be patient. That is quite a different thing from a man who comes with an invading Army into his own country, helping a foreign nation to invade and overthrow his own country, and then, when he sees that that foreign nation is going to be beaten, changes over to the other side. You must be just, even to Marshal Badoglio.

What I have said and repeat is that he and those who fought with him against the Communists and have taken refuge upon the island of Formosa should not be invaded and massacred there while the United Nations Forces possess such overwhelming naval superiority.

Gentleman that there were no specific agreements further than the general policy that we have been following under both Governments of support for the United Nations and that, in particular, the right hon.

Except for the useful patrolling work of the little Blimps around the harbours they were not otherwise of much military value. To-day the Admiralty possess no airships, but in view of their small offensive value against submarines, and their extreme vulnerability to attacks from enemy aircraft and from the anti-aircraft armament of U-boats, there is no need to deplore our deficiency in this respect.

I had never heard of them before—[An HON. MEMBER: "You would not."] I treat with contempt such taunts. I had never heard of this firm until the managing director sent me all the correspondence he had had with the Ministry of Supply over the last two and a half years, in which he had been begging to know whether he should continue to export these vital materials to Soviet Russia in view of the darkening of the scene, and had never been able to get any decisive answer of any kind—only the kind of woollen fluff that we are served up with today. I am quite sure that the firm is under no blame and is not negligent. They only pointed out that Russian inspectors have the right to come into the factories, were pressing to come, were walking about the factories freely. and that the work in the factories both for the Government and for Russian and Polish exports was naturally mixed up together. I think it is unfair to throw blame upon them. All they did was to send their correspondence to me, and I alone am responsible for the use which, with their full permission, I made of it.

If that is to be your Ruling, Major Milner, then I think it would be better if the discussion on this present Amendment were limited strictly to its terms, and that we should preserve all our rights to have a full discussion on the main issue, which is the Amendment to leave out paragraph (c). If, however, a Debate were to take place on that Amendment and the present one now, it would affect the duration of the Debate on the Amendment relating to paragraph (c). If it is desired to keep this Debate on this Amendment strictly to the terms of the Amendment, then, of course, the main discussion of the evening will fall on the Amendment relating to paragraph (c).

We were led to believe that the object of this Bill was only to remove doubts. It was for the purpose of removing doubts as to the working validity of the 1945 Act. We were led to believe that possibly the courts might hold that, an emergency of a peculiar character having now arisen, the phrase "transition from war to peace" would no longer cover the interim powers granted under the 1945 Act. We were led to believe that. If there was only this doubt, we thought it only right to put down an Amendment to remove the doubt. We do not seek to alter at this moment—little though we like them—the vast powers which are enjoyed by the  Government under the 1945 Act. But, it appears now that all this is wrong. There is no question of removing doubts. The right hon. and learned Gentleman has the effrontery to get up and say at that Box, "No, there is no doubt about all this." I have never heard such stuff.

We are told now that there has never been any question of doubt in this matter. Certainly we were told that there was doubt, and I have certainly every reason to believe that the doubt operated in respect of the word "existing" regulations, and that no new regulations could be made under this Bill apart from those which have already been made under the 1945 Act. After all, there is the Lord President of the Council. I have a great deal of confidence in his sense of fair play. [Laughter.] I have when it comes to a dead-level talk across the Table of the House. He knows perfectly well that we were assured that existing regulations were all that were to be involved in this Bill, and that the Government were afraid the existing regulations would be hampered by arbitrary or far-fetched constructions being put upon them by the courts, and that consequently, at a moment when there is a grave emergency, the Government's powers may be hampered and restricted.

1947-8-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-8-11;Clause 1—(Extension Of Powers Under 9 & 10 Geo 6 C 10);83;The hon. Member makes a mistake to found his argument upon the idea that there is no difference between party Government and partisan Government. Undoubtedly the majority in the House of Commons is effective for all legislative purposes, but a Government which represents all parties has a moral authority to deal with matters which is not possessed by a party Government seeking to carry out its class and partisan prejudices and animosities over the heads of its political opponents. That is my answer.

There is no sort of comparison between the dangers in which we were in June, 1940, and the kind of dangers we are now in. In 1940, the dangers were brought upon us by the terror and power of the enemy. Now the difficulties and dangers we are in, which I certainly do not wish to underrate or understate are, we hold, largely due to the mismanagement of the party opposite. That is altogether apart from their escaping from their faults, neglects and incompetence by the assumption of sweeping powers, which in their hands will only make matters worse.

Consequently the lighthouse service has never assisted us in reporting enemy activity. I think that should be noted. In view of several recent savage anarchic attacks by German aircraft upon lightships round our coast and the murder of some of their crews, special measures will be taken to provide protection for this service; and where possible, light floats will replace lightships in outer positions.

The remark-  able thing, since I am drawn into this by this interruption, is that the political parties did not at all sway the influence and actions of the Indian millions. Millions of men volunteered, without conscription, to fight, and great numbers gave their aid in war work, and the political parties, who are the only parties—the hon. Member for Aberavon (Mr. Cove) drew me into this—with whom the Government arc dealing had no means of controlling the enthusiasm and loyalty of their people.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);229;No, I must be allowed to make my own speech. As I say, I do not wish to be drawn from the straight and narrow path which I have marked out for myself in this discussion, because I might easily add to the length of the Debate, which I have no wish to do, We have had a very full statement from the Government. Nevertheless, although, as I say, we got no assistance, we declared that the offer which we had made should stand. The present Government had, therefore, a right to our agreement and support in sending out the Mission of Cabinet Ministers, who have just returned after arduous experiences. The directions given to the Mission, however, went beyond, and, as I hold, needlessly beyond, those which governed the wartime Cripps Mission of 1942. The Coalition offer was, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman has just reminded us, of Dominion status, which includes, of course, the Clause in the Statute of Westminster, what we might call the escalator Clause, which affirmed the right of secession, in the last resort, from the British Commonwealth of Nations by any Dominion, The Coalition offer was also conditional upon agreement being reached between the principal parties in India, so that the offer of full Dominion status, including the right to secede, would not lead to disastrous, and possibly devastating, civil war.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);41;My point was that the right hon. and learned Gentleman took out a different scheme. As a great precision man, and a man of the very highest legalistic attainments, a small point like that ought not to have escaped his notice.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);129;In the first place, the right hon. and learned Gentleman has not got the two parties to agree; they are in the most violent disagreement, and their passion is mounting day by day. In the second place, the scheme which he took out was a different one. In the third place, when that scheme did not commend itself to those to whom he addressed himself, he took the positive action—and I do not say he was wrong from his point of view to do it—of trying to solve the Indian problem for the Indians instead of leaving it to the Indians to solve, or not to solve. He took the positive course of trying to solve it, and proposed a basis on which he hoped they would come together.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);91;In 1942, the right hon. Gentleman had no authorisation to attempt to make a separate declaration  apart from any view built up between Indians, as he has done now. I am not making this a complaint against the right hon. and learned Gentleman; I can quite see that when they were there and nobody would agree to anything, the third party came in and said, "Let us have a try. Won't you agree to this?" All I say is, that it is quite different from the proposals to which we agreed.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);25;The right hon. and learned Gentleman has made a very long speech, but if he wants to make a further one, I will sit down.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);203;I am not making an accusation against the Government in the matter. I am sure the right hon. and learned Gentleman does not deal with people in bad faith, and those gentlemen who were there may have been misunderstood. There has been a serious misunderstanding, but the consequences of the misunderstanding carry us forward  into the future. The General Secretary of the Muslim League has gone se far as to say that unless the situation is clarified, it would be suicidal for the League to enter into a Constituent Assembly. All this appears to raise the most formidable issues, because I can assure the Government—and those who have been to India know well—that the agreement of the Muslims to the new system affects the whole foundation of the problem. One cannot contemplate that British troops should be used to crush the Muslims in the interests of the caste Hindus. Whatever our responsibilities may be, whatever may be the day appointed on which we quit India, we must not make ourselves the agents of a caste Government, or a particular sectional Government in order to crush by armed force and modern weapons, another community which, although not so numerous, is numbered at 90 millions.

1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);283;I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. Gentleman again but I have been tackled on this question. There is all the difference in the world. The Statute of Westminster allows every Dominion the right to secede and in the case of a great many Dominions there would be no difficulty about it, if they decided no one would raise any question. There may be, however, great differences of opinion if one of the Dominions considered a proposal to secede, and that might exercise a great deterrent upon the decision which the Dominion would take. My hope would be that such a deterrent would have the effect of making the Dominion unitedly decide to remain within the British Commonwealth, a course which, I hope, we have not altogether brushed aside. However, it is another matter when we try to short-circuit the process and say, "Take independence now." That is what the Government are going to get, and they are going to get it very soon. They should not blind themselves to the idea. There is going to be no hesitation on the part of those with whom the Government are dealing in taking full and immediate independence. That is what is going to happen. I did not hear the speech of the hon. Member for Northern Midlothian and Peebles (Lord John Hope), but every person in the House is entitled to express his or her own view in these matters. It is a well-known fact that I have differed in past years from the line taken by the Conservative Government in this Parliament and I do not think we should have been in this miserable plight if my advice had been taken then.
1946-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-18;India (Cabinet Mission);13;It is a great advantage to the right hon. Gentleman to do it.

These centres, 11 in number in England and Wales, and two in Scotland, are residential and are under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland. For those not requiring, or no longer requiring, in-patient treatment, out-patient facilities and social help are available at clinics and through other mental health agencies conducted by local authorities or voluntary bodies. These latter services are not at present complete or fully co-ordinated, but are being developed under the auspices of the Board of Control as far as war conditions allow.

1953-2-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-2-10;National Service (Government Policy);95;No, Sir. If it be true, as we all earnestly hope, that the danger of a third world war has receded—and that is a matter which no one can declare with certitude—it is largely due to the exertions made by this country, by the United States and by our allies in Europe to place ourselves in a position of defence; and if at what may be a critical and delicate moment in world history we were suddenly to make a pull-back of this kind, it might do harm far outside anything we can think of.

1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);41;This is an interesting controversy and it is one which, I think, is very properly made a subject of debate. Certainly the dispute is not one about which there should be ideological cleavages, party feeling, bad temper, or even insulting language.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);123;The hon. Gentle man had better wait. He will get a chance later. Let me point out that when the decision to go into production with the E.M.2 in isolation was declared by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) on 25th April, 1951, at that time the problem of finding a common type of ammunition had not been solved and the British pattern rifle had not been devised, as it now has been, to take the ·300 round. Therefore, I asserted—this is the only reason I am speaking in this debate—that such policy was a great mistake, but I do not impute any evil motives to the right hon. Gentleman, and I am glad to feel with Pope that: 
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);33;:As I say, the fact remains that the right hon. Gentleman very authoritatively adhered to the ·280 round at the time when no arrangements for production of a common round had been made.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);33;:All I say is that a vote was taken after the trials, and notwithstanding the vote, which I have described, the British representatives decided to adopt the ·280 round and go ahead alone.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);50;:No, Six. Notwithstanding the fact that that was the opinion of the different countries at the Conference, it was decided to go on with the ·280 round and to go ahead alone. This was a grave decision, and such was the position which we found when we came into office.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);28;:Yes, Sir. Various modifications were thereafter incorporated in the Belgian rifle, and, in 1953, it was subjected to further tests, when it was judged to meet our requirements.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);46;On a point of order. I demand an apology for that extremely discourteous remark. To say that a Minister dealing with a highly technical and complicated question and endeavouring to give the House information is deliberately falsifying his statements is, I think, unparliamentary in its character.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);5;I have given way once.

1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);56;The conclusion reached in 1951 by the British Trials Board was that the Belgian F.N. was  technically the most efficient on the score of dependability, functioning and accuracy. Various modifications were thereafter incorporated in the Belgian rifle, and, in 1953, it was subjected to further tests, and was then judged, in 1953, to meet our requirements.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);105;I was Minister of Defence when the present Government began, and after a certain time my Noble Friend, Lord Alexander, became Minister of Defence. It has been quite a frequent event to happen with Governments that offices are changed during their continuance. I accepted this advice, which was given to me through the regular channels without any initiation by me, in my dilatory condition, as the hon. Member opposite said, after studying the papers and arguments submitted. The policy received  final Cabinet approval on 1st December last. I gave the House, in answer to a Question on 19th January, the main reasons for that decision.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);64;:I only say that that is one of the reasons why I personally like what I have been able to learn about this weapon. I do not pose as a technical expert, but I pose as a man capable of seeing what a disaster it would have been if we had gone for a round which no other nation in our alliance was sharing.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);20;:Why should the hon. Gentleman say that? I do not suppose the hon. Gentleman has carried a rifle very far.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);139;:I do not withdraw at all. I see nothing invidious or insulting in speaking of the length of time that people have carried a rifle. Certainly not. I do not feel at all ashamed to say that the F.N. is a more soldierly weapon on the march and is more suited for use in manual exercises—[Hon. Members: "Ah!"]—which hon. Members opposite mock at, but which are very important for discipline and morale. I am assured that it is also easier to teach soldiers how to use this rifle, and that is important in these days of short service. Last, but not least, I repeat what hon. Gentlemen opposite so foolishly mock at, that the F.N. is a better weapon both with the bayonet and with the butt and is capable of giving confidence to a soldier in a mêlée.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);56;As hon. Gentlemen on that side of the House are always looking round in every controversy, even in this one about rifles, to try to find  fault with the Americans, I suppose if I were to say that the Americans had accepted it, the hon. Gentleman would regard it as a further argument against the rifle.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);54;:I am not in the least alarmed by being shouted at. In fact, I rather like it. The descendant of Paget's "Examen" will, I hope, be very careful and precise in his facts, and be careful in not misrepresenting and misquoting and otherwise defaming other people. He was a great defender of my ancestor.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);85;I really did not know that the hon. Gentleman came into this. I saw the former Secretary of State for War, I saw the hon. Member for Aston (Mr. Wyatt); the Leader of the Opposition has a great responsibility, and there is the late Minister of Defence. I thought that they would all have a claim to have a whack, but I do not see why, in a short debate like this, the hon. Gentleman cannot take his chance of rising when he is called.

1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);25;I am told that I yielded. All that happened was that I could not persuade the President of the United States to accept our rifle.
1954-2-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-01;British Army (New Rifle);3;I do not.
1947-3-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-05;Death Sentences, Gold Coast;50;I apologise to the House. I was not aware that this matter was to be raised, and I did not hear the opening discussion. I presume that it is understood on all sides that these men will not be executed until there has been a further Debate in this House.
1947-3-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-05;Death Sentences, Gold Coast;75;I should like to know what is the answer to my question. I have ventured to put this point, that people ought not to be brought up to execution, or believe that they are to be executed, time after time whether innocent or guilty, however it may be, whatever their crime. That is a wrong thing, and I trust we shall have an opportunity  of testifying in that matter before an irrevocable act is committed.

1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;51;Yes, Sir. The North Atlantic Treaty Defence Committee have agreed that there should be a Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic and that he should be an American. An American officer has already been nominated for this appointment, and it is expected that an announcement will be made on this matter very shortly.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;106;Were there no British admirals capable of discharging these functions; does not Great Britain lie at the very key of all communications across  the Atlantic with Europe; are not the sea approaches to our island in the event of submarine attack vital to our life; and how is it, with our experience, which is longer and wider than that of any other country, and when we have all agreed with so much pleasure that General Eisenhower should command the Armed Forces on land, that we should have resigned any claim that we may be thought to have, to the command of the sea on the Atlantic?
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;51;In an organisation of a number of Powers, as in the North Atlantic Treaty organisation, an appointment is made by those Powers. No Power has an absolute right to dictate its views as to any appointment. I understand that the proposition that an American admiral should be appointed was generally acceptable.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;85;Does this not argue a great decline in our influence and in the esteem in which we are held by other countries with whom we are in the most friendly relations? Did the right hon. Gentleman make any effort to put our claims forward in a sober and earnest fashion, or did he simply accept the fact that we are to be brushed out of the way in this matter which, of all others, apart altogether from history and tradition, is vital to our existence?
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;70;Hon. Members must give me a moment to get up; I am perfectly prepared to answer. This matter was, naturally, very fully discussed, but I say again that this is a matter for agreement. The general conclusion was that this was the best appointment. I cannot at the moment say whether there was an elaborate discussion or not, but in any international organisation of this kind, of a number of—
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;30;In an organisation of a number of countries, it is not possible for one country to insist on its right to some particular office. It is a matter for discussion.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;55;It was possible, anyhow, not very long ago, for one country to sink 525 German U-boats compared with 174 by the United States. No one is going to argue that I am hostile to the United States, but I do not think that our country ought to have fallen so far into walks of humility.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;126;May I ask the Prime Minister whether this matter is finally settled or whether he will, in view, I think, of the widespread feeling in the House, make a further appeal to the United States to consider this matter in all friendship and loyal feelings of comradeship? As the hon. Member for Attercliffe (Mr. J. Hynd) has said, on the land we welcomed General Eisenhower; the Americans alone have the atomic bomb, which covers a great part of the air, but  here, in this question which is absolutely vital to this island, will he not ask them to give it further consideration? I am only asking that the Prime Minister should believe that they are very ready to treat loyal Allies with all fairness and generosity.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;76;I will certainly look into the matter. I cannot say more than that. As I understand it, they have selected the admiral who seems most suitable for this matter. [HON. MEMBERS: "Name."] The name I cannot say. [HON. MEMBERS: "Who are 'they'"?] "They" are the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The name has not yet been announced. I will take into full consideration everything that the right hon.

1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;28;It is late in the day for the Prime Minister of this country to look into the matter. Might I ask him whether he was not consulted beforehand?
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;22;Yes, Sir, the matter has been very very fully considered. I am saying that I will reconsider it and look into it.
1951-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-22;Supreme Commander, Atlantic;24;I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for saying that he will look into it again and see what can be done.

1949-4-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-28;India (Commonwealth Relations);183;Perhaps I may be allowed to ask whether the Lord President is aware of the deep interest with which we have listened to his statement. I am well aware of the difficulties of clock time and sun time throughout the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations—and I do not say that they have been satisfactorily solved on this occasion,—which seem to assign to London and Great Britain 2 a.m. as the moment of release for an important declaration. One would think this might be a matter for further consideration on future occasions. But I am all the more glad that His Majesty's Government have met the request which I made to them with the full support of my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the Liberal Party, that the joint declaration of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers should be reported formally to the House and thus take its place not merely—or, perhaps, I ought to say, not only—in the newspapers, but in our Parliamentary records. Any other course, I feel, would be derogatory to Parliament and especially to the Mother of Parliaments.
1949-4-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-28;India (Commonwealth Relations);43;I should like to put this point. It seems to me that, far from being any derogation of the Monarchy, the proof of the attachment and importance that all the Dominions gives to it has shown the strength and vitality of that institution.

1940-11-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-11-05;British Prisoners Of War;199;His Majesty's Government have had this whole matter under review. Responsibility for the despatch of parcels to British prisoners of war has, by arrangement with the Government, been undertaken by the war organisation of the British Red Cross Society and Order of St. John. The influence and usefulness of the Society are largely due to its independence of Government control, and its relationship with the International Red Cross at Geneva rests on that basis. In these circumstances to appoint a member of the Government to the Council of the Society, as suggested by my hon. and gallant Friend would, in the view of the Government, be likely to defeat the very objects which he has in mind. As regards Questions in this House, various Government Departments have responsibilities in connection with prisoners of war, and I think it is desirable that Parliamentary Questions should be addressed to the Ministers responsible for those Departments. I have, however, arranged that, in order to meet the convenience of the House, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for War will answer any Questions raising general issues relating to prisoners of war which are not specifically the concern of another Service Department.

Gentleman might well have thought of some variants to the general indictment which we all remember he threw upon us then. I am quite sure the right hon. Gentleman did his best, and he had every reason to do his best. We shall have the opportunity of seeing how this works out before we get to the end of the day. I should like to look back a little on the course of events in order rightly to judge this Motion on the Paper. On Tuesday last we were expecting a strong, vigorous debate upon the Steel Bill. At the end of Questions, when we were about to take this important discussion, the Adjournment of the House was moved about a tragic incident in Kenya, and, after some vehement discussion, this was permitted by Mr. Speaker.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);172;I am only discussing this particular episode in Kenya in order to draw the attention of the House to what actually happened before the proceedings on Tuesday night. I am giving the House my own feelings at the time. When there is such a state of affairs as in Kenya, I thought myself that, if there were a debate and Division on this matter, we might rupture and break the nerve of these young people, and we might well find that great disasters and bloodshed would follow. Not only might there be a massacre, but the whole structure of Government might be weakened. All the settlers throughout this scattered country would be in mortal peril. [Interruption.] Hon. Members opposite will give me credit for not being afraid of interruptions or noise. It even would be much easier to be shouted down continually or booed down, because I have not the slightest doubt I could obtain publicity for any remarks I wish to make, even if they are not audible in the House.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);12;I am certainly not making any reflection at all upon the Chair.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);13;I will not withdraw the word "wanton" or any other word I use.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);46;Further to that Ruling. It is quite true that he has to get the leave of the House, but it is Mr. Speaker who says whether it is a matter of definite urgent public importance. That is a Ruling as to the nature of the subject.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);106;I hope I shall be allowed a measure of free speech. I thought it was perfectly understood that the Chair interpreted the rules of the House. Those who put these rules into motion, and those who, when opportunity is given to them, cry for action—they are the ones who take the actual responsibility. And it is to them, and to them  alone, the word "wanton" applies. I have got a lot to say, and I shall have to keep the House several hours if we go on at this rate. Nothing will induce me to be frustrated in unfolding the argument—not even sham points of order.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);99;Rarely have I seen such a change of mood in the House. The Oppostion Members trooped out in all directions, and a quiet, half empty House was left to listen to the debate on a Measure which, we were told, was such a flagrant example of reactionary legislation. Nothing could more clearly vindicate the Government in allocating only two days to the debate on the Second Reading of the Iron and Steel Bill than the lack of interest—and, I may say, of argumentative power—shown throughout the proceedings by the Opposition. [Interruption.] I am going through what happened on Tuesday.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);28;—was withdrawn. I am going on with the story. Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen must look at how things strike other people, even if they do not agree.

1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);65;There was—[Interruption.] I remain wholly unaffected by this discourtesy and interruption, because  I know that nothing can possibly do more harm to hon. Gentlemen opposite than shouting down, and breaking down if they can by repeated interruption, the Minister who is responding to an official Motion of censure. Do not, I beg of them, imagine that this distresses me, except by contemplation of their conduct.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);116;I am telling the House what happened. It was due to the contrast between the stormy debate about Kenya and the apathy on the Iron and Steel Bill. As I said, this is not an excuse. It is, however, an honest explanation of the error we made in thinking that all faction was over for the night. I am confessing quite plainly that we were in error. But what was the conduct of the Opposition? Only four of their Members were present at the time—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—only four of their Members were present—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] The Opposition must not be afraid of argument; do not be afraid of what is coming; brace yourselves to bear it.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);49;I have already said that we regret that we did not keep a quorum. I have already explained that the reason was that after the other debate on Kenya had been concluded there was—[Interruption.] Well, if hon. Gentlemen opposite will not listen I will not interrupt my own speech.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);49;I will be perfectly frank with the House. I was better employed in sound slumber on that occasion. I was, of course, paired. If I had not  taken some of these precautions I should not have sufficient strength to sustain the ordeal to which I am now being subjected.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);30;That is a tempting subject—the Gas Bill. The right hon. Gentleman has given great study to it, which he will no doubt benefit by now that he is in opposition.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);25;Cannot you let your right hon. Friend have the afternoon, anyhow? As the right hon. Gentleman is so lonely, I will treat him with chivalry.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Business Of The House (Censure Motion);70;I was not reproaching any of my hon. Friends behind me but trying to throw rebukes upon those who are in the wrong this afternoon. It seems to me that it is quite clear that with this process of a handful of Members, unable and unwilling to divide the House, nevertheless delaying the whole process of legislation, they could produce a situation different from any which has hitherto confronted Parliament.

1951-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-14;(Government Policy);122;I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way to me for a moment. The reason we have not felt entirely comfortable about what he has said is that he is always saying, "We have doubled this; we have doubled that," without our knowing what "this" is. He says that we have made a 40 per cent. increase. On what? On x, and so on. Now he used two phrases, that there would be a considerable improvement and that there would be really large-scale production; but none of these things has anything definite in it. He must excuse a certain amount of scepticism and doubt where there is no foundation given, no datum line from which the multiplication takes place.
1951-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-14;(Government Policy);4;What does that mean?
1951-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-2-14;(Government Policy);53;The right hon. Gentleman said something about the conditions at the beginning of the last war. It must be remembered that the Air Force that won the Battle of Britain and saved our lives was one which was entirely set on foot, and the squadrons and the machines and everything organised, before 1940.

1947-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-29;Distilling (Barley Allocation);2;Yes, Sir.
1947-1-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-29;Distilling (Barley Allocation);36;Is it not the case that the price of a bottle of whisky exported to America to gain dollars is five shillings, or something like that, and that here it is about five times as much?
1943-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-22;Armed Forces (Saluting In Streets);36;No, Sir. A salute is an acknowledgment of the King's Commission and a courtesy to Allied officers, and I do not consider it desirable to differentiate between one city or town and another in this matter.
1943-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-4-22;Armed Forces (Saluting In Streets);7;I Should take exactly the opposite view.
1944-7-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-7-20;Evacuation;81;It is certainly very improper that details for all places should be given, because it gives the enemy advice as to how to direct their fire. The general figure of 170,000 evacuated from London would have no effect other than to disappoint the enemy, who would have expected more. A very great deal of this matter can be talked about. There are, however, particular points you do not want to talk about, and most people can see those points for themselves.
1944-7-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-7-20;Evacuation;29;If you took a particular borough and said there had been a very large figure of evacuees from that place, it would show that there had been some damage.

1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;64;May I ask the Prime Minister a Question of which I have given him private notice, namely, whether his attention has been drawn to the Motion referring to the European Consultative Assembly which is on the Paper? It is supported by a large number of Members, almost 100, belonging to all parties in the House. Will he now make a statement on this matter?
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;51;Yes, Sir. I am aware of the Motion to which the right hon. Gentleman refers, but I am not able to make any statement on the question  of the United Kingdom representation in the Consultative Assembly until all the Governments concerned have finally settled the constitution of the Council of Europe.
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;16;Can the right hon. Gentleman give any indication or idea of how long this will take?
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;10;I should hope it will not be long delayed now.
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;17;But what does "long delayed now" mean? A month or two months, or what will it be?
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;23;I could not say more exactly. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will put a question to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;132;I hope the right hon. Gentleman realises that I am anxious to rescue him from the very uncomfortable and invidious position in which he lies in the meanwhile when he appears to be denying that each representative of Great Britain shall be free to speak and vote as he or she thinks fit at any meeting of the Consultative Assembly; and, secondly, that the British representatives at the first Consultative Assembly should reflect the relative strength of the political forces in the House of Commons and should be appointed from Members of both Houses by a Resolution of this House. The point I am going to put is whether the right hon. Gentleman can afford indefinitely to go on denying, or appearing to deny, recognition to these obvious democratic truths and principles?
1949-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-3-10;European Consultative Assembly;64;The right hon. Gentleman is founding his question on assumptions that he chooses to make. I have neither affirmed nor denied any of these propositions; I have merely informed him that it is usual to wait until a constitution has been formed and agreed upon before taking action. That is all there is to it. The right hon. Gentleman jumps off before the pistol.
1939-9-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1939-9-04;Torpedoing Of Steamship "Athenia";122;I regret to inform the House that a signal was received in the Admiralty at about 11 p.m. last night  giving the information that the steamship "Athenia" had been torpedoed in a position about 200 miles north-west of Ireland at 8.59 p.m. Orders had already been given by local Commanders for destroyers to proceed to her assistance, and by shortly after midnight four destroyers were proceeding at high speed towards the position. They should have been near the position by about 10 a.m. this morning. A further signal was received from the Master of the ''Athenia'' at about 1 a.m. this morning stating that there were 1,400 passengers, some of whom were still on board, and that the ship was sinking fast.
1939-9-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-04;Torpedoing Of Steamship "Athenia";76;I need scarcely say that the utmost endeavours will be used to employ all our means of escorts to their fullest possible capacity, and to adopt such other methods as may be necessary for vessels which fall outside the class and cannot at this moment be convoyed. We have every belief that the convoy system will be brought into complete operation at a comparatively early date. In the meanwhile all that is possible is being done.
1939-9-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-04;Torpedoing Of Steamship "Athenia";36;There are several legal issues which arise from this outrage, but I do not feel able to speak upon them particularly at this moment.

1939-9-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-04;Torpedoing Of Steamship "Athenia";55;It certainly was torpedoed without the slightest warning, in circumstances which the whole opinion of the world after the late War, in which Germany concurred, stigmatised as inhumane. According to my present information—I must confess that I have not had any opportunity of confirming it precisely—the ship was not in any way an auxiliary cruiser.

1940-7-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-7-04;French Fleet;128;It is with sincere sorrow that I must now announce to the House the measures which we have felt bound to take in order to prevent the French Fleet from falling into German hands. When two nations are fighting together under long and solemn alliance against a common foe, one of them may be stricken down and overwhelmed, and may be forced to ask its Ally to release it from its obligations. But the least that could be expected was that the French Government, in abandoning the conflict and leaving its whole weight to fall upon Great Britain and the British Empire, would have been careful not to inflict needless injury upon their faithful comrade, in whose final victory the sole chance of French freedom lay, and lies.

The Admiralty propose  to rely during the war upon the methods of voluntary recruiting which have served the Royal Navy so well in the past.

1939-10-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-04;Recruitment And Promotion;67;We do not attempt to draw the slightest distinction of public status or of honour between the age groups and the volunteers, but in computing the share which the Navy have of the age groups, the volunteers who like the life on the sea will be given the preference, and as there are a great many of these, the question will be one of picking them out.
1939-10-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-10-04;Recruitment And Promotion;68;I am naturally dealing with war time promotions at the moment, but we have to deal with the regular services of the Royal Navy, and I do not  propose for a moment that the 75 should be the maximum. I intend it to be the minimum, but, of course, we have to consider the number of officers who will be on our staff after the war is over.

1952-12-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-19;Nato (Paris Conference);59;The matter is one which affects not only the Foreign Office but, indeed, in bulk the Ministry of Defence; but I will give my personal attention to the matter in order that a full statement can be laid before the House, which can be meditated upon and which we can debate at the first convenient opportunity when we return.

The submarine was immediately attacked by one of the screening vessels and there is every reason to believe that she was destroyed. His Majesty's Ship "Courageous" had on board 1,202 officers and men; this was somewhat less than her full complement, as she had embarked a reduced number of aircraft. A large number of survivors have been picked up by destroyers and merchant ships, amounting in all to 687 officers and men. The Commanding Officer, Captain Makeig-Jones, went down with his ship. The names of the survivors are being issued through the Ministry of Information as soon as they become available.

1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;264;My right hon. Friend does not deny that he made merry. The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence is not, of course, an executive officer, but a co-ordinating officer, and, in fact, his staff does not consist merely of his personal assistants, but it is to be found in the whole machinery of the Committee of Imperial Defence. I think probably most hon. Members are of opinion that my right hon. Friend has performed invaluable services in the work of supply. He is not, of course, the Minister who places contracts, but he has a great work to do in allotting priority of orders among the three Services, and of making sure that their programmes are kept in proper balance and not thrown out by deficiencies in one section or another. He has, then, in that direction performed invaluable services. But after watching his activities closely, I feel that I can with complete confidence give the House an assurance that the original object which we had in mind in appointing him has been achieved. Co-ordination, which already even before his appointment did exist, has been greatly strengthened and improved. The system of control, which has been described on a previous occasion, is working smoothly and efficiently. As hon. Members know, it is based upon the Committee of Imperial Defence, of which the Prime Minister is Chairman, and the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence is Vice-Chairman. He is responsible, on behalf of the Prime Minister, for the supervision and control of the whole  of the organisation and activities of the Committee of Imperial Defence.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;105;I do not propose to enter into details in this opening statement. I have no doubt that in the course of the Debate a great number of questions will be asked by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, and there will be an opportunity, before the Debate closes, for a reply by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence. That will be the time for the hon. Gentleman to get answers to such questions as should be answered, and it is not now desirable that I should interrupt the general statement I was going to make by going into matters of detail.
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;72;It proceeds on the assumption that the Government have changed their policy, and, in particular, have abandoned the League of Nations. I, on the contrary, claim that I am a  better friend of the League than some of those who speak of it. The League to-day is mutilated; it is halt and maimed; and those who, like myself, do their best to build it up afresh to be a real world League—
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;190;—which could protect the weak and limit the powers of the strong, serve it better than those who would attempt to put on it in its present state tasks which are manifestly beyond its strength. What is, in fact, meant by this phrase that peace can be attained only through collective security under the League of Nations? We have never said that in no conceivable circumstances could collective security under the Covenant be provided, but I ask what small country in Europe to-day, if it be threatened by a larger one, can safely rely on the League alone to protect it against invasion? I challenge hon. Members opposite to answer that question. There can be only one honest answer to it, and that is "none," although a small nation may have powerful friends who will act as its guardians and protectors, and so preserve the peace. If that be so, why should we try to persuade small nations that they can rely on peace where there is no peace? Why should we mislead them by giving them an assurance of security when any such security can be only a delusion?
1938-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-07;Defence;249;There is no foundation for the charge. But I have to deal with a world in which dictatorships exist. I have no interest in other forms of government, except in so far as they react on other countries. I have no bias in favour of Nazism, Fascism or Bolshevism, because all of them seem to me to be inconsistent with what is all-important to me, because it is the root of my political creed, and that is individual liberty. No sensible man will ask that liberty, even the liberty of the individual, should be completely unfettered. That would merely be to allow one individual to gratify his own selfishness at the expense of others. But subject to reasonable restrictions, I believe in liberty of thought, of speech, of action. Without that there  can be no true democracy. I do not believe that a democracy need necessarily be less efficient than other systems of government. It may, indeed, sometimes lag behind in time in making its decisions, but, at any rate, democracy can do what no dictator can permit himself; democracy can afford to make mistakes. For the preservation of democracy, which means the preservation of our liberty, I myself would fight, and I believe that the people of this country would fight. I am convinced in the innermost core of my mind that the course we are pursuing in putting forward our present programme for Defence is the surest way of avoiding the grave necessity of fighting at all.

Member for Ipswich (Mr. Stokes) is, I am sure, entitled to the compliments of the House for his maiden speech. Not only did we sympathise with him in those internal tremors which are so often the prelude to excellent preformance both in this House and in the field, but the House, I think on all sides, will have felt that we may look forward in the future to contributions from him to our Debates of a sensible, solid and practical character. I shall not attempt to follow the hon. Gentleman into the topics which he specially selected, though I think he was quite well-advised to speak to us for the first time on subjects which he had studied particularly and of which he had had special experience. I do not wish to be drawn into details on this occasion, neither do I feel very much inclined to discuss those rather fearsome Amendments  by which it is sought to overlay this Debate.

But I did imagine that he put it that those who had asked for a Ministry of Munitions had, so to speak, wished completely to absorb the whole industry of the country on munitions. If there had been a  Ministry of Supply, plans could have been made upon a nation-wide scale as other countries are doing, and there would have been no need for the successive afterthoughts and readjustments following from short and partial views. Those afterthoughts have marred the whole of this period. The Government refused to create a Ministry of Supply, but the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, intended for quite a different purpose, has laboured hard to do the work. We are told, also, that he has done all his other work, too. I hope so, and, if so, he deserves cordial thanks and most unstinted admiration, because the tasks which he had to do seemed to go beyond the capacity of any human being that we know of alive to-day, or even read about in the more expansive days.

Keyes) made a very interesting contribution to the Debate, and I was particularly interested in his quotation from his correspondent in Yugoslavia. Unfortunately, that correspondent was apparently unaware of the Prime Minister's declaration that henceforward the small nations could not look to the League for any support. I am grateful to the hon. and gallant Member because he has brought the Debate back to the subject of Defence. In March, 1936, Mr. Baldwin, as he then was, said:

1940-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-7-30;Secret Session;290;A week ago the Government were led to believe that there was a desire in the House to have a Debate about foreign affairs, and that it was the wish of the House for it to take place in secret, so that Members of all parties could say what they really felt about foreign countries without any danger of adding to the number of those countries with which we are at present at war. It is always the desire and also the duty of the Government, so far as possible, to meet the wishes of the House, and arrangements were accordingly made for this afternoon. However, it appears that some of the newspapers prefer that the Debate should take place in public, and we are assured that secrecy is undemocratic, especially in times of war, that it would be wrong for Members of Parliament to have privileges in matters of information not enjoyed by the whole mass of the nation, and that the Government should take the nation and the enemy fully into their confidence and let the whole world see plainly exactly how and where they stand in relation to all other countries in the present critical juncture. These arguments, or others like them, seem to have made an impression in various quarters of the House, and the Government are now in the embarrassing position of a servant receiving contradictory orders from those whom their only desire is to serve. We therefore have found means to give the House an opportunity of expressing by Debate and Division, the opinion whether the Debate should be secret or public. Also we have arranged that this preliminary Debate can itself take place under conditions of the fullest publicity. I conclude by moving, 
1946-7-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-10;Foreign Commercial Broadcasts;37;Are we then to understand that the British public are free to listen to anything they like, and anything they can, but that the Government will exercise restraining force on what is allowed to reach their ears?

1944-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-4-21;Empire And Commonwealth Unity;326;When we planned this Debate together through the usual channels, it was well understood that its main purpose was to enable the House to express its opinion, and that the Government would have no far-reaching declaration of policy to make. Indeed, it has been everywhere recognised that for us to commit ourselves to hard-and-fast lines of policy, or even to the advocacy of particular suggestions or proposals, would not be appropriate on the eve of the first meeting we have been able to arrange—after, I can assure the hon. Member for Eye (Mr. Granville), many attempts—of all the Dominion Prime Ministers since the war began. Thus viewed, I think it will be almost universally admitted that the Debate has been a great success, and has been of far-reaching usefulness; that the Motion on which the Debate is founded is acceptable to all; that there is, as the Noble Lord has said, an all-party agreement on most fundamentals; and that the level of the discussion has been worthy of the breadth of the subject, and has been distinguished by speeches of a statesmanlike character, for I can use no other word for speeches such as I heard yesterday from my hon. Friend the Member for Seaham (Mr. Shinwell), and to-day from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Devonport (Mr. HoreBelisha) and the Noble Lord the Member for Horsham and Worthing (Earl Winterton)—although, after the very kind compliment the Noble Lord has just paid me, I was not quite sure whether I had not better leave him out. I must regret that I could not hear all the speeches which have been made, but I sat up till half past two this morning reading the full report of every speech, and I crave the indulgence of the House for not having been constantly on the Bench during this Debate, on account of some other things which, hon. Members may know, it is my duty to look after.

I have no intention of passing my remaining years in explaining or withdrawing anything I have said in the past, still less in apologising for it; but what I am concerned to do is to show to the House, and also to Members of my own Party, how strictly I have, during my stewardship, safeguarded the structure of Imperial Preference, which has arisen out of the controversies and achievements of the last 40 years, against any danger of being swept away in the tumult of this war. At my first meeting with the President of the United States, at Argenta in Newfoundland, at the time of the so-called Atlantic Charter and before the United States had entered the war—a meeting of very anxious and critical importance—I asked for the insertion of the following words which can be read in that document:

Members, but no doubt the House will desire that I should make a statement on the subject. The result of the meeting at Berchtesgaden on 12th February between the German and Austrian Chancellors was stated by the former to be an extension of the framework of the July, 1936, Agreement. Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen will recollect that that Agreement provided, among other things, for the recognition of the independence of Austria by Germany and the recognition by Austria of the fact that she was a German State. Therefore, whatever the results of the Berchtesgaden meeting were, it is clear that the agreement reached was on the basis of the independence of Austria.

This has been for all of us a week-end of great strain, and I fully appreciate the need on this occasion, on every occasion, to speak with the utmost restraint and with a full sense of responsibility. We are face to face with events grave in themselves, which may lead us far to still graver events. We have first of all to see the passing, or what looks like the passing, of a great historic State, Austria. For the last two decades Austria has survived in a truncated condition and during the last decade has been a pawn in the rivalries of great Powers. She has not been a free agent. Her Government has been influenced now by the dictator of Italy, now by the dictator of Germany. She has been pulled now by one and now by the other of these two great Powers, and she has been torn, too, by rival emotions. On the one side the people have a natural affinity with their fellow Germans across the frontier. On the other hand they had the desire to preserve their great cultural heritage.

There were other things in her speech with which I found myself much less in agreement. But I do not propose to trench upon any of the controversial or party or recriminatory grounds which enter into many people's minds, and which might well be exploited upon suitable occasions but seem inappropriate to the grave circumstances in which this Debate is held. The speech of the Prime Minister overshadowed the Debate and dominates all our minds. I do not know when in my lengthening experience of the House of Commons I have heard—certainly not since the War—a statement so momentous, expressed in language of rigid restraint but giving the feeling of iron determination behind it.

Members took the opportunity of Divisions to stand about in fixed positions on the Floor of the House, whereby they might obstruct the movement of other hon.

There will be a British war medal which will be given over the whole area, but I cannot attempt to make any pledge in the matter. The question of the issue of this widely distributed medal will be one we can take up when the war is over.

My difficulty is that I do not feel that he has bridged the gulf between the awe-inspiring facts which he mentioned and the practical method of solving them by the Motion—moderate, and certainly well-intentioned—which he has placed upon the Paper.

I do not really see why I should be blamed. When, after the Election in 1945, I quitted the office of Prime Minister which I had held during the war, our position was very different. I feel that it will be in the national interest, and can do nothing but good on both sides of the Atlantic, if I now make public for the first time the agreement which I made in 1943 with President Roosevelt, which was signed by both of us at Quebec. President Eisenhower has informed me that he is content that I should do so. The House will find this document in the Vote Office when I sit down. I thought it right to lay the facsimile before the House, but here are the salient facts. I wrote them out myself those many years ago. 
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;45;I do not understand the right hon. Gentleman saying that we abandoned any precautions.

Gentleman to whom.! alluded, that I hope he will be specially helpful now, in consequence of what happened. I do not say that there were not many reasons and facts operative at the end of the war which were different from those during its course, but considering that the abandonment of our claim to be consulted and informed as an equal was the act of the Socialist Administration—
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;65;I must ask the Prime Minister on what grounds he says we abandoned any claim. We did not abandon the claim; we made the claim, and I believe that the United States Administration were fully prepared to carry it out. They were prevented by the action of the Senate, which passed the MacMahon Act, which prevented them giving the information. We did not abandon anything.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;51;They abandoned the agreement, or took action which enabled the agreement to be destroyed. [Interruption] Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite must not show so  much uneasiness in the matter. I feel they have no ground for reproaching their successors with the consequences. [HON.

1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;129;I am coming to that aspect a little later, but I will transpose what I have to say to meet the wish of the House. I return to the Quebec Agreement as a whole—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]. Why do not hon. Gentlemen opposite listen? Why do they say "No," especially when they do not know what I am coming to? When I visited the United States two years ago, I showed this document that will soon be in the Vote Office to Senator MacMahon, whom I had known for some time, and who was a man of the highest honour and outstanding patriotism to his own country. [An HON. MEMBER: "So is McCarthy."] He said at once, "If we had seen this agreement there would have been no MacMahon Act."
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;164;I regret that the Prime Minister made an attack on me in this matter. I never reproached him with any  of the terms of the Quebec Agreement with regard to the industrial side of it. The right hon. Gentleman said that we had abandoned it. He now tells me that Senator MacMahon did not know of the Quebec Agreement. Surely, that is not a reproach on me. If it is a reproach on anybody it is on the United States Administration. The right hon. Gentleman will remember that I did not go by myself. I went with Lord Waverley to try to settle these matters. We had an agreement with the Administration, and we were informed they could not carry it out because of the Senatorial action in the MacMahon Act. Surely it was not for me to send the MacMahon Committee or Senator MacMahon this information? If the right hon. Gentleman is making any attack, he is making it on the Truman Administration.

1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;94;I did. I made reference to it in a former Parliament. I hesitated to make a public disclosure as a private person, but I did communicate with Mr. Truman on the subject, and he strongly appealed to me not to do so—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—but I frequently urged the right hon. Gentleman to make this agreement public. This matter can be looked into and debated at length, but I am quite certain that if the agreement which I made had been made public, it is very unlikely we should have had facilities withdrawn from us.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;54;I am of opinion that the agreement should have been circulated in confidential circles in the first instance to the American Government. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] The war was over, and there was no reason at all why this solemn agreement, signed by President Roosevelt and me, should not have been brought into proper consideration—

1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;25;I think it would have been an obvious precaution to confront them with that agreement. [HON. MEMBERS: "Resign."] Anyhow, they were not confronted with it—

1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;114;The right hon. Gentleman said that I referred to the quid pro quo which was given in the new agreement—namely, giving up the right to commercial and industrial production. It can, of course, be said that in the fourth article of my agreement with President Roosevelt I abandoned all rights to the control of industrial and  commercial nuclear power and left them entirely to the President of the United States. He was to act in accordance with what he considered was fair and just and in accordance with the welfare of the world; whereas the Socialist Government regained these rights in return for sacrifices in the share of the control of the military aspects.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;77;The right hon. Gentleman now says that we abandoned control over the military in exchange for advantages on the industrial side. We never had advantages on the industrial side. There was no bargain of that sort. I think it is a pity in this debate that all the time the right hon. Gentleman is attacking us for not developing atomic energy. I never mentioned the Quebec Agreement and giving away the industrial advantages. I was too loyal.

1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;70;We never got much out of that. We did get agreement for close co-operation and working. I should like  to say to the right hon. Gentleman—I do not want to go into the question of negotiations with the American Government —that he knows the difficulty where an agreement has been made by the President and it has subsequently come to the knowledge of the Senate, who have not been consulted.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;51;That was done with full discussion between the Administrations, and when I went over there in 1945, the results of our talks were published. There is, however, this point. This was a particular personal agreement with a President who is now deceased, and we had to deal with a successor Government.
1954-4-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-4-05;Hydrogen Bomb;59;I was attacked by the Prime Minister, and it was suggested that I had bartered all kinds of safeguards for no advantage at all.

1937-7-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-19;Supply;140;We are indebted to the Secretary of State for having treated us this afternoon, very appropriately, considering the circumstances of the Debate, to a comprehensive review of the more critical aspects of foreign relations all over the world, and the official spokesman of the Opposition has followed with no less expansiveness and with very careful and painstaking attention to many details. I notice that the only difference between the outlook of the two Front Benches is that whereas my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs says that the outlook is not entirely black, my feeling after listening to the hon. Member on the Front Opposition Bench is that on the whole the outlook is rather grey. I shall not attempt to emulate either the Government or the Opposition in taking so wide a view this afternoon.

Resistance to Communism and to a Communist revolution—that is the point made by the hon. Member for Bridgeton—is not a class issue. Everyone knows that in a Communist or Bolshevist revolution what are called the upper classes, the nobility, the landowners, the financiers, the manufacturers, the clergy, the bourgeoisie, and the bulk of the intelligentsia, are destroyed. They do not last very long, there is not enough  of them to go round, and the really successful Communist revolution, once that provender has been used up, begins killing the ordinary working classes, and I have no doubt that you could show that hundreds of ordinary weekly wage-earners have perished in Russia in the revolution for everyone of those classes I have mentioned. After they have begun killing the working classes they, of course, at the same time start killing each other, a process which I am bound to say I have always been able to contemplate with a fairly steady eye.

It would have been strange for the Government to have sold a destroyer to any Power outside the Atlantic Pact at this time, when anti-submarine vessels are regarded as top priority in our shipbuilding programme. But to have given one to Egypt in the circumstance and at this moment is, I think—I appeal to the ordinary unprejudiced common sense of the House—quite inexcusable.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);42;Not at all. The hon. Gentleman has been on all sides in this particular question.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);30;All right. I think that was a very foolish thing to do, but it was done in the period of the war when, naturally, arms got loose in different directions.

At any rate, the course which he has adopted, as I shall presently show and have to some extent shown, has certainly not led to the conclusion which the right hon.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);75;I was trying to correct the right hon. Gentleman on a point of fact. It is quite true that my right hon. Friend was ill, but he was an effective Foreign Minister throughout. It may well have shortened his life, but it is quite untrue to say that Mr. Bevin ever let his hand go off the Foreign Office.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);63;That, of course, is a matter of opinion, but I adhere strongly to my statement. I fully admit that the Prime Minister had opportunities of closer study of what was actually taking place, but, anyhow, he is directly and personally responsible for allowing the Foreign Office to be without effective guidance during all this critical and, as it may well prove, costly time.

But the  giving and promising of our support to such measures of security and preparation is quite different from, and has no relation to, the urging upon the Executive of definite military operations. For these, the initiative and sole responsibility fall upon the Government of the day.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);82;But this I must say in conclusion. If the Government so manage this affair as to lead in the end to the total evacuation of the British oil personnel from the Abadan refinery, it will be our duty to challenge them here and in the country by every means in our power.

We had instead a speech punctuated all through by the cheapest of jibes against the Government and against Members of the Government, and not even sparing a late Member of the Government who is dead. The right hon. Gentleman, I think, might have left that alone.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);25;Before the right hon. Gentleman can be sure of that, he had better get a periscope and watch them when next he makes a speech.

1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);20;How many million would there have been if the right hon. Gentleman had tried to put down India by force?
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);95;I am now dealing with a matter in which I know the noble Lord is particularly interested. I am dealing with Palestine, on which I should like to see the noble Lord march together with his Leader. The one chance that I thought we might have had of settling the Palestine question before it became so exacerbated was in the war-time Coalition Government. It was very unfortunate that the right hon. Gentleman did not take up the matter then, because there would have been a great chance, I think, of getting agreement on the matter.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);11;Is the Prime Minister talking about me or the noble Lord?
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);165;Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman said that it was an impression of weakness that we gave. That was quite wrong, because we were not weak. There is a very sedulous propaganda to try to show that we are weak everywhere. I was struck by the speech of the hon. Member for Lancaster (Mr. F. Maclean), for whose writings I have  a great admiration; but his was a most surprising speech which seemed to ignore everything that has been happening in the world. He seemed to think that somehow or other we could have maintained enormous forces, for they were enormous forces, in the Middle East and everywhere else, and he seemed to think that that was the policy put forward by the Opposition. It was never so. The Opposition always realised the limitations on the possibilities of what we could do in arms, and it is well known that we have been endeavouring all the time to build up our strength in the Middle East.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);3;War-time sterling balances.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);133;Yes, war-time sterling balances. That was not a matter peculiar to Egypt. It was a fact that these heavy balances were piled up. I dare say that some of these payments were far too large for the services rendered. But the House must remember that these were delayed payments for things and services that we utilised in the war. It may be that we ought to have made a better bargain, but no action was taken during the time of the war-time Government to warn these  people and tell them that we would not pay these balances. There was no decision that this obligation would not be honoured. There was no decision by the Government. I know the right hon. Gentleman talked about it very often but a monologue is not a decision.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);11;The quotation which I made was from a speech in 1947.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);4;I have got that.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);21;And the right hon. Gentleman was able to interject his "Yes, Sir," in the monologue of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);109;The right hon. Gentleman is a little previous. I am still in 1944–45. I am coming on to 1947 and to the next point. Of course, we should all have liked to scale these balances down, but we could not do it just by arbitrary action. We could only seek agreement, and that is precisely what we did. We sought agreement; we were unable to get that agreement. It is perfectly well understood. The right hon. Gentleman talked about United States loans and the rest of it. We agreed we would do our best to scale down the balances, but we never suggested there should be a unilateral repudiation.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);15;I think we should have a discussion in the House before ratification; I quite agree.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);12;I am assured that this one would not be useful to us.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);42;Was not the Hunt class destroyer one of the type of destroyers that are now being furbished up for use in, the event of a U-boat attack? Was not the payment made quite simply by crossing out something of these sterling balances?
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);93;That is quite possible. Obviously, it is not much good releasing to people their sterling balances if they cannot buy anything with them. The right hon. Gentleman is like Mr. Bultitude who said to his son, "What is. the good of half a crown to you? You will only spend it." We base our rights in Egypt on the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. and so long as we do this we have to honour our own obligations under the  Treaty, one of which is to facilitate the supply of arms to the Egyptians.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);39;And the plant. This seems to me to be really what we wish to bring under this rather general phrase of nationalisation. At the present moment we are accepting that principle. The details will have to be worked out.
1951-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-7-30;Foreign Affairs (Middle East);42;I think the statement made was perfectly clear on that. There may have to be a withdrawal from the oil wells and there may have to be a withdrawal from some part of Abadan, but our intention is not to evacuate entirely.

1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;313;I think that, perhaps, it will be for the convenience of the Committee if I intervene at this stage and make what contribution I can to the Debate this afternoon. It has been observed that this is the last occasion on which we shall have a Debate upon foreign affairs before hon. Members go away for the Recess, and certainly one cannot deny that at the present moment there is more than one centre of unrest, and no doubt the House would like to have some information from me. In the position like that at the present time when we are conducting a number of negotiations with foreign Powers, some of them of a highly delicate character, I feel, at  any rate, that it is an occasion when one should be careful what one says, and, in particular, that one should not seek to exaggerate any differences that there might be between us. I cannot say that I think that either of the two speeches to which we have just listened are very successful illustrations of that national unity to which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness (Sir A. Sinclair) is never tired of repeating that I am the only obstacle. There is a curious difference of view between the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton). The right hon. Gentleman thinks that unless I endorse in firm and unmistakable terms a speech made by the Foreign Secretary, it must be assumed that I do not agree with him. On the other hand, the hon. Member opposite paints a picture of a Foreign Secretary in chains; he has no mind of his own, but can only say what is put into his mouth by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. These two views may be said to cancel each other out.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;130;Why is the hon. Member now making it the subject of his complaint? I cannot follow the hon. Member in all his inconsistencies. The hon. Member and the right hon. Gentleman opposite both devoted a large part of their speeches to the negotiations with Russia. Both of them suggested, though they did not actually say so, that the delay in coming to an agreement was entirely the fault of this Government. I do not know whether the French Government were also included. Both of them said that they had been kept in the dark, although the hon. Member opposite afterwards professed to give a time-table, I think he called it, of the negotiations to illustrate his thesis that the delay had all been on the side of the British Government.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;197;I know that the right hon. Gentleman said that, but he said it in such a way as to convey the impression, the deliberate impression, that though he did not seek to allocate the blame, meaning to say that he could not prove it, he wished the House to understand that the blame did lie, and lie entirely, with the Government. The hon. Member opposite has been very proud of his persistence in asking questions about the course of these negotiations for a long period of time, and, in fact, he has tried for a long time to goad me into recriminations against the Soviet Government by seeking to put the blame for the delay upon this Government. If I have restrained myself, if I have refused to enter into discussion as to the differences which prevented the completion of the agreement between ourselves and the Soviet Government, if I have done that all this time, that is the measure of the sincerity of my desire to come to an agreement. I can assure the Committee that it has required some self-control to abstain from refuting the false impressions which the hon. Gentleman has sought to convey.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;10;We did that in regard to France before the War.
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;191;Yes, but the conditions were very different. Here is a country which is a long way off and with which we had not had close relations for a very long time. We are showing a great amount of trust and a really strong intention to bring these negotiations to a successful issue when we can agree to send our sailors, soldiers and airmen to Russia to discuss how we can make our military plans together before we have an  assurance that we shall yet be able to come to an agreement upon political matters. The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the course of conversation, expressed the view that if we once begun these military conversations, to which he attached very great importance, the political difficulties should not prove insuperable. It was that expression of view which weighed with us in taking this very unusual decision, and it certainly is the sincere hope of the French Government and ourselves that this anticipation of M. Molotov will be realised and that we shall find it possible to agree not only in substance but also in form upon the remaining outstanding political difficulties. 
1939-7-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-7-31;International Situation;70;The right hon. Gentleman says that I made an attack on him. I did not begin the attack. As he has attempted to excuse himself, may I say that he seems to me to take up every rumour which is damaging to the Government, without committing himself specifically to it, and to give it as much publicity as he possibly can. It encourages foreigners to repeat it without its qualifications. 
1949-2-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-2-17;Official Report (Mr Speaker's Ruling);24;May I ask you, Sir, whether you have anything to add to the statement which you made yesterday concerning HANSARD and the OFFICIAL REPORT?
1949-2-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-2-17;Official Report (Mr Speaker's Ruling);49;Your explanation, Mr. Speaker, makes matters very clear. I should like to say we all have great confidence in HANSARD. Its early publication is an immense convenience to Members, who are glad that there is, as it were, a further check, in case large questions of law are involved.
1943-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-10-28;House Of Commons Rebuilding;4;I beg to move, 
1943-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-28;House Of Commons Rebuilding;239;I think I might be allowed to proceed. I shall not be very long, and then perhaps my hon. Friend can make his own speech. His Majesty's Government are most anxious and are indeed resolved to ask the House to adhere firmly in principle to the structure and characteristics of the House of Commons we have known, and I do not doubt that that is the wish of the great majority of the Members in this the second longest Parliament of our history. If challenged, we must take issue upon that by the customary Parliamentary method of Debate followed by a Division. The question of Divisions again relates very directly to the structure of the House of Commons. We must look forward to periods when Divisions will be much more frequent than they are now. Many of us have seen 20 or 30 in a single Parliamentary Sitting, and in the Lobbies of the Chamber which Hitler shattered we had facilities and conveniences far exceeding those which we are able to enjoy in this lordly abode. I am, therefore, proposing in the name of His Majesty's Government that we decide to rebuild the House of Commons on its old foundations, which are intact, and in principle within its old dimensions, and that we utilise so far as possible its shattered walls. That is also the most cheap and expeditious method we could pursue to provide ourselves with a habitation.
1943-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-10-28;House Of Commons Rebuilding;326;—and so, when I speak of rebuilding the House of Commons in 18 months, it is, of course, without panelling or carving, which can be added as the years pass by. It is simply a Chamber for us to dwell in and conduct our Business as we require to do. The timber must be set aside now if it is to be properly seasoned. The Clipsham Quarry, from which the stone was procured for the maintenance and replacement of the Houses of Parliament, is temporarily closed. It would have to be reopened. We must then consider very carefully the strain upon our labour  resources. The First Commissioner informs me that for the first six months after the plan has been started, after the word "Go" has been given, only 46 quarrymen and demolition men would be required, of which half would be over 40 years of age and the other half over 50 years of age. In the second six months 185 men would be required over 40 and an equal number over 50. But of those over 50 years of age 60 would be masons, whose trade has so little work at the present time. In the third six months—and we shall be getting on by then—we shall require 170 men, not additional, over 40 and an equal number over 50. All the 170 over 50 would come from the building trade; the 170 over 40 and under 50 would come from the engineering trade. This last is a much more serious consideration. But there is no need for us, even when the whole scheme is approved and the work has begun, to commit ourselves to the rate of reconstruction. We can fit it in as a stand-by job. It might well be that in a year's time, when we require men from the engineering trade, our affairs might be in such a posture that we should be looking for jobs rather than for men.

1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;7;May I answer the first one now?
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;36;Every effort is made to what I might call dovetail these arrangements and to utilise labour not immediately needed for defence purposes for the export trade, but there are some gaps which cannot be immediately filled.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;151;In regard to the second of the three questions which the right hon. Gentleman has put to me, it is a fact that, if the three-year re-armament programme drawn up by the late Government had been carried through in full, considerably heavier Estimates would have to be met by Parliament than those which we shall now present. One of the important causes of that is, of course, the rise in prices, but it is not the only cause. The cause is that, as production gets on the move, there is an acceleration and expansion, and very often things are achieved on a somewhat larger scale at an earlier moment than perhaps was estimated for; but, broadly speaking, if we had gone on with that programme which we found on arriving in office, there would have been considerably heavier expenses to meet, and it might have affected the balance of payments adversely.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;59;I am not sure of that. I do not think there can be any debate on this before Christmas, but when the White Paper is produced we come into the whole process of examination of Estimates, and not only of Estimates of the Defence Vote, which carries with it the general discussion of the whole field of public defence.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;86;No, I could not do so in detail without notice; I would not be able to remember at this moment. But sometimes it is better to slow down the production of weapons which are being superseded by newer and better types in order to be more ahead a little later on. The fact that we have felt able to do that indicates, on the whole, that we do not think that the worst emergencies with which we might be faced have approached any nearer to us.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;68;These are difficult questions to answer on the spur of the moment. The original £4,700 million programme carried with it three years of maintenance. Now it is spread over four years, and we have advanced in time, so  it is spread over four, and, in part over five years in which there are new maintenance charges running each year, and, in addition, there is the rise in prices.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;57;I think I said some time ago that it would be £5,300 million at the value then prevailing, but it is more than that now, and if we take a fourth year it may be well over £6,000 million. I do not think we can be reproached with not taking a serious view of the financial aspect.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;170;No, Sir. As I have said, we always guard ourselves upon the point of solvency and capacity to produce, because these estimates were originally produced to meet a great emergency. It had to be done very quickly indeed, but now it comes home in much more detail. As far as manpower is concerned, I can undertake that we shall not call up a single man who is not absolutely necessary for the discharge of our obligations, but I think that at this critical juncture above all others, for Great Britain, if we, instead of setting an example as far as we can in terms of service to the Continental Powers, were to make a violent reduction in our manpower or in our terms of service, the result could not be estimated merely by any reduction in our own strength. It might bring about an almost complete collapse of the great organisation which grew up under the previous Administration and for which its  leading Members have the responsibility and the credit.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;86;Oddly enough, and without further investigation, I should imagine it would be the Admiralty itself. It always used to be. All these matters will require and deserve the searching attention of the House next year when the Estimates are presented for each of the Service Departments. Also, I can say now that, once the White Paper has been laid, be shall be anxious to afford the fullest facility for a debate on the subject which, however one looks at it, ought to be a non-party affair.
1952-12-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-12-04;Defence Production Programme;25;Certainly. They are actually engaged in combat in both those theatres, and obviously they have the first claim on the supply of munitions of war.

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;33;On a point of Order. I wish to ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether you can give us any guidance as to the scope of the Debate on the Motion of the Prime Minister?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;124;I submit that the terms of that Motion were set down before this incident arose, that they were taken over by the Prime Minister, that it is entirely concerned with the Official Secrets Acts, that it was not set up to consider the position of a Member of this House who is summoned before a Court of Inquiry or a military Court, that it is to inquire into the action of Ministers with reference to the proceedings under the Official Secrets Acts, but that that was under consideration by this House before this  incident arose. Therefore, that Motion had not this particular action of the Secretary of State for War and the Army Council and the Court of Inquiry in mind at the time.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;5;The terms of reference mentioned 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;56;May I argue further on your Ruling? I take it that I am right in assuming that we are entitled to debate the report of the Committee of Privileges and everything contained in that report, and that the contrary opinion may be expressed and sustained from any quarter of the House. For instance, take this sentence: 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;117;With great respect, and apologising for pressing this point, which is of some importance, I will ask you this: Might not the fact that the Committee of Privileges makes no reflection on the Military Court be due to the fact that the Secretary of State has accepted responsibility, and would it not be proper to state that in the Debate, as showing the reasons why the Select Committee did not make, or might be assumed not to have made, any reflection on the Military Court? Are not questions of reflection on the Military Court and matters connected with the reasons why they did not make a reflection, arguable matter, and germane to the discussion of the Report?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;98;Surely it is open to this House to consider the report of the Committee of Privileges, and if you say that the report of that Committee puts the blame on the Court of Inquiry, is it not open to someone to urge in this House that the Committee puts the blame wrongly, and that it should have put it on the Secretary of State for War for setting up this Court of Inquiry, knowing that proceedings were taking place in this  House? Is not that point arguable by a Member on the report of the Committee of Privileges?
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;43;Did I understand you to say, and did I hear you aright in saying, that the report of the Committee of Privileges put the blame upon the Military Court of Inquiry?

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;6;Without making any reflection on them.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;145;Are you not making an assumption that every Member might not necessarily make, that when once that Military Court was set up the Minister had no power to stop it, interfere with it or influence it? Is not that a question which can be discussed in this House? There is nothing in this report that lays down that when once the Court is set up the Secretary of State cannot interfere with it. We do not know whether he did interfere, but it is arguable that he might have interfered with it, and I am putting it to you that in discussing this report of the Committee of Privileges we are entitled to discuss it freely, and that there should not be any limitation by assuming  that the Secretary of State or the Military Court did something which is not contained actually in this report.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;36;Is it not an assumption to say that the Secretary of State's interference ended with the setting up of the Military Court? We have no evidence that he did or did not; we do not know.

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;10;With respect to you, Sir, it says just the contrary.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;297;It is, of course, a fact that the House may not choose to agree with the report of the Committee of Privileges, but, nevertheless, I am sanguine enough to hope that they will not take that course. The report of the committee was short; it dealt with only a single incident; and it was unanimous; and I have not seen or heard any criticism of the conclusion at which the committee arrived. It might, perhaps, be thought, from this general approval, that the committee had had an easy task, and that their conclusion was foregone. I would like to tell the House that the matter was not so simple as that. I do not know whether the Select Committee over which my right hon.

Gilmour) is presiding will find themselves in a position to lay down any general principle as to the extent of, or as to the limitations upon, the privilege of Members of this House; but, whether they do or not, in the meantime it is the case, as is pointed out in the report, that there is no formal authoritative statement about privilege to which reference can be made and by reference to which judgment can easily be pronounced as to whether a certain action is or is not a breach of Privilege. That being so, the committee sought guidance from the pages of Erskine May, and also from the knowledge and experience of the Gentlemen at the Table. Erskine May is not very definite about the question of Privilege, but there is one passage which the committee had before them and which is important in this connection. It occurs on page 73, and I will read it to the House. It says: 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;31;I will say suggested—[HON. MEMBERS: "By whom?"] At any rate, it was a matter of question. I am not judging the question; I am trying to give an entirely objective account.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;263;I do not want to enter into a controversy. I withdraw the statement, so far as my hon. Friend is concerned. I would rather put it this way, that action had been taken with the result that it was alleged that a breach of the Official Secrets Act had been committed. My hon. Friend must be presumed to have taken his action in the interests—or what he conceived to be the interests—of the State. The House, having had information upon this matter, proceeded subsequently to set up a Committee to investigate the circumstances of the case. A military court had also been set up, and, although the purpose for which the court had been set up was a different one, although they were approaching the subject from a different angle and in regard to a different individual, yet the incident to which the proceedings had reference was the same as that which formed the subject of inquiry by the Select Committee. Before the Committee of Privileges had reached its conclusions the question of any clash between this military court and the House of Commons had ceased to be of any practical importance, because the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry had been adjourned until after the Report of the Select Committee had been made. Nevertheless, that did not seem to be any reason why the Committee should not make their recommendations in accordance with the terms of reference to them. The Committee reported, in the words which I am going to read again, because they are the important part of the Committee's Report: 
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;236;On a point of Order. May I submit to you that there were three  statements by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys)? The first was on 27th June, which was a Monday, and the matters arising out of that are the matters that are referred to the Select Committee according to the Motion by the Prime Minister on the day when he set up the Select Committee. But subsequent to that there was on 29th June a further statement by the hon. Member for Norwood, in which he said that he had been summoned to appear before a military court of inquiry, and it was on that second statement that the Committee of Privileges was set up, and the matter referred to the Select Committee is the questions that were raised by the hon. Member for Norwood's statement on 27th June, which contained no reference at all to the military Court of Inquiry, because at that time he had not been summoned to attend before it and may not even have known that it was set up. I submit, therefore—and I wanted to catch your eye when you gave your previous Ruling —that this question of the military Court of Inquiry is not among the matters submitted to the Select Committee, because they are directed to inquire into the statement of 27th June, which contains no reference at all to the military Court of Inquiry.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;137;I would like to submit that you have ruled that this matter of the setting up of the Court of Inquiry is one of those matters which will be inquired into by the Select Committee. It forms part of their reference. The Select Committee is appointed to inquire into the substance of a statement made on 27th June by the hon. Member for Norwood and the actions of the Ministers concerned. I take it the Ministers were concerned in the matter in that particular complaint and any subsequent complaint, and what I want to make sure of is that  if we are ruled out from raising the matter in this House we shall not be subsequently ruled out on the Select Committee by a statement that the matter arose on something which took place after 27th June
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;210;I came to the House this afternoon not at all expecting that any controversial matter would be introduced into our discussion. I am still disposed to make a very few observations, mainly of a laudatory character on our Ministers, our institutions and, generally, on the way in which this Privilege affair—I am keeping very strictly within the limits of the topics that we can discuss—has been conducted. Except in one respect, which I shall come to later on, which has newly dawned upon my conscience, I am in hearty accord with the Report of the Committee of Privileges, which I understand it is in order for us to debate. I feel that we owe a debt to our chairman, the Prime Minister, for having led us unanimously to this conclusion. The technical grounds of this breach of Privilege are clear. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) has pointed them out. A Member of this House while preoccupied with the duty to attend before a Select Committee, of which the Prime Minister had already given notice, was summoned to appear before an inferior court upon the same subject or upon matters cognate to that subject. He was, therefore, in a Parliamentary sense obstructed in the performance of his Parliamentary duties.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;236;That was not a case where officers set themselves against the authorities, they resigned their commissions, but I should be straying rather far from the narrow path along which I have to progress if I attempted to deal fully with that matter, although I am quite capable of discussing it in detail. But military questions, obviously of the highest consequence, are raised in view of the fact that it appears that this Court is alone responsible for its action and that there is not responsibility higher than this Court. I shall not press any further upon this subject, though I feel astonished that we have not had an appeal to the Chair by the Secretary of State for War to be allowed, almost as a personal matter, to stand between this subordinate Court and the censure which is now directed upon it. Every instinct would have prompted him to spring up and say not merely "I take the full responsibility" in the technical sense, but to say it precisely that these officers were obeying the orders of a higher authority in everything they did. The blame does not rest upon them but on those who have told us that they accept responsibility for their action. That is all I wish to say on this particular subject which I might, indeed, have illuminated a little further but for the conditions under which we are discussing the matter.
1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;49;I was under the impression that, in signing this Report, I was casting no reflection on the Military Court, but I have heard from you, Sir, that the Report puts blame on the Military Court.

1938-7-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-11;Privileges;49;Since the hon. Member puts that question to me, I am ready to answer it. The meaning I attached to it was that the Military Court had committed a technical offence, but that it was not considered that they had deliberately attempted to challenge the authority of the House.

I should have thought that the Adjutant-General, in the ordinary course, would have said to the Secretary of State for War, "This matter is taking its course, but in view of what happened in the House of Commons yesterday, ought it not to be suspended?" If the Adjutant-General had not said that, then the Secretary of State himself ought to have said, "In view of what happened in the  House of Commons yesterday, obviously this court must be delayed." That is what would have happened, according to my experience.

This Debate deals specifically with the Report of the Committee of Privileges; that is what we are discussing naw; and certainly I myself, when I heard that it was proposed to insert these words exonerating the military Court, naturally came to the conclusion that it remained open to the House in debate to search further for the person upon whom the breach of privilege censure alighted.

Silverman) to withdraw the words which he had uttered applying to the hon. and gallant Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd)—[Interruption.] —I am content to wait.

1947-11-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-06;Public Appointments (Ministers' Recommendations);132;A few moments ago, with my own ears I heard the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne use the expression "offensive lie," I heard you ask him to withdraw, and I heard him very becomingly defer to your Ruling. What I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, is that my hon, and gallant Friend the Member for East Renfrew did not rest his case on the use of an offensive expression but upon a charge. Therefore, I ask you if you would discriminate in your Ruling between the duty of hon. Members to withdraw offensive expressions which they use, and to withdraw charges—[Interruption.]—I am not speaking to hon. Members opposite, but. to Mr. Speaker—and to withdraw charges which it is perhaps their duty to bring to the notice of the House of Commons.
1947-11-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-06;Public Appointments (Ministers' Recommendations);153;On a point of Order. We are now on the question of what is a Parliamentary expression and what is not. I was always brought up to believe that "lie" was an unparliamentary expression, but greater latitude has been given to that in late years. "Liar" is unparliamentary, but "lie" has often hitherto apparently been passed. The hon. Member below the Gangway, very properly, withdrew his expression at your request. Therefore, "offensive lie" has been regarded this afternoon as unparliamentary. I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, whether the expression "political nepotism" is unparliamentary. Is it wrong for the Opposition, or for any Member of the Opposition, or my hon. and gallant Friend, to put down a Motion on the Order Paper attacking the Government in which the expression "political nepotism" occurs? We must have the freedom of the use of language to describe the processes which are going on at the present time.

1939-9-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1939-9-26;U-Boat Warfare;267;The war at sea opened with some intensity. All our ships were going about the world in the ordinary way, when they were set upon by lurking U-boats, carefully posted beforehand. In the first week our losses in tonnage were half the weekly losses of the month of April, 1917, which was the peak year of U-boat attack in the late War. That was a very serious proportion. We immediately replied in three ways. First, we set in motion the convoy system. This could be very quickly done for all outgoing ships, but it took a fortnight to organise from the other end the convoys of homeward-bound ships. This system is now in full operation — in full operation both ways. Meanwhile, however, large numbers of ships which had started independently, under the ordinary conditions of peace, had day after day to run the gauntlet of the waiting U-boats with-  out being either armed or escorted, and in consequence a serious, though, I am glad to say, diminishing, toll was exacted. The convoy system is a good and well-tried defence against U-boat attack, but no one can pretend that it is a complete defence. Some degree of risk and a steady proportion of losses must be expected. There are also other forms of attack besides U-boats, attacks from surface craft and from the air, against which we must be on our guard. I can assure the House that every preparation is being made to cope with such attacks, but I must again warn the House that we cannot guarantee immunity and that we must expect further losses.
1939-9-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-26;U-Boat Warfare;104;But that is the great problem for us — to find destroyers for our many needs, many needs which I cannot mention to the House, which make great demands upon us. This hard stroke of war in no way diminishes our confidence in the methods now at our disposal. On the contrary, our confidence in them has grown with every day they have been employed, and I believe that their potency will become more apparent in proportion as the great numbers of new vessels come into action, and in proportion as our hunting officers get the knack of using depth charges by frequent practice.
1939-9-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-9-26;U-Boat Warfare;105;— where we were unlucky in losing some tankers, we have lost 60,000 tons in the first fortnight and gained 50,000 tons from the enemy, apart from the enormous additional stores we have brought safely in in the ordinary way. Again, I reiterate my caution against over-sanguine deductions. We have, however, in fact got more supplies in this country this afternoon than we should have had had no war been declared and no U-boat had come into action. It is not going beyond the limits of prudent statement if I say that at that rate it will take a long time to starve us out.

1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);84;(by Private Notice) asked the Lord President of the Council whether he is aware that, following on his statement of 4th December, Questions from Members relating to the various industries that have been nationalised during the present Parliament are not accepted at the Table, and whether, as this situation affects the rights of Parliament in respect  of large spheres of public business of widespread concern to the nation, he will allow an early opportunity for a full discussion of the far reaching issues involved.
1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);331;The right hon. Gentleman will, I trust, agree with me in the general principle, that Members should have the freest possible right to put Questions on the Paper without prejudice to the undoubted right of Ministers to refuse to answer them if they consider the public interest is involved and if they are supported by the general feeling of the House? That is the only principle that I am wishing to assert. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, at the present time, whole blocks of very important topics, in which enormous numbers of people are interested and concerned, are ruled out because it is thought that Ministers do not wish to have those Questions answered, and because it is alleged that Ministers have no particular power over the nationalised industries in question, whereas, in the case of a good many of the industries that have been nationalised, specific powers have been retained by the Government both in regard to the securing of information from the industries and in regard to control over them? Will he bear this in mind, that there is no question at all of denying the ultimate right of a Minister to refuse to answer Questions provided he can carry with him the support of the House of Commons, but that there is grave objection to whole  classes of Questions being excluded even from being placed upon the Order Paper as a result of some Ministerial utterance? On the question of the Debate upon this subject, we gladly receive the right hon. Gentleman's assurance that conversations may take place with a view to fixing a date; but I must submit to him that this matter is not a party matter, that the Questions come from all parts of the House, that it concerns the Procedure of the House of Commons, and that, therefore, we consider most strongly that it rests with the Leader of the House to offer reasonable opportunity for this discussion in the Government's time.
1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);109;With very great respect, I am a little taken aback by the extent of the Ruling which you have given on this matter, Mr. Speaker. For a great many years, Sir, I submit to you, there has grown up the custom that the Table—and we have the greatest respect for the manner in which the Clerks at the Table discharge their duties—have only refused, say, questions of a particular class affecting individuals, and reflecting sometimes upon them. This has grown up by custom of the House. But now, suddenly, a vast mass of topics—whole series of topics on vitally important business affecting millions of people—has come under this bar.
1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);25;Why does the right hon. Gentleman suppose that in the war the  Minister of Information "got away with it "—to use his own colloquial expression?
1948-2-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-2-04;Socialised Industries (Questions To Ministers);201;Was that not because he was supported by the majority of the House of Commons? Is that not the right foundation on which Ministers can rely for the endorsement of their discretionary powers as to whether or not they should answer a Question? If Parliament, by a majority, supports them, and if it is the general feeling, no one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and feelings—[Interruption.] Just listen. No one wishes to run counter to the wishes, decisions and the majority of the House in these matters. But with regard to putting a Question on the Paper, surely the presumption should be that any Question may be put on the Paper unless barred by those long customs of good taste and non-assailment of individuals, which have been accepted by the House for generations. The presumption is that anybody may put a Question on the Paper. Does the right hon. Gentleman not realise that we are not objecting at all to the power of the Government, supported by the House of Commons, to refuse to answer Questions? What we are criticising is the institution of an arbitrary and mechanical bar to the placing of those Questions on the Paper.

Gentleman the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir A. Sinclair) made a speech which was largely devoted to personal attack upon myself.

Gentleman might like to follow the Leader of the Opposition. It appears that, in the mood in which the Opposition find themselves, they prefer that I should speak at once, and I am quite ready to satisfy them in that respect. On the whole, I think the right hon. Gentleman made a speech which was perhaps less bitter and less intemperate than I had expected. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I do not know why, but it was, although there were in it a good many rather paltry sneers. Of course it is pretty obvious that on this matter hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite have very deep and strong feelings, and in these circumstances it is perhaps rather difficult to get a patient hearing for the voice of reason. [Interruption.] The right hon. Gentleman says that there  is no reason, but, at any rate, there are attempts at reason. The other day I was very much interrupted, and certainly had not a very good chance of pursuing a connected argument. I do not know whether I shall be any more fortunate this evening, but, whatever the result, I ask hon. Members in all parts of the House to remember that they too have their responsibilities, as well as Members of the Government, and that, when they are touching on subjects which may bring us near to that dangerous borderline which divides peace from war, we ought all to remember those responsibilities, and ought not merely to look at the circumstances of the moment, but to think also of the possible consequences of any action that we may take to the lives and fortunes of our fellow-countrymen. Great indignation has been expressed by Members of the Opposition at the attacks upon British ships and at the destruction of British property—a matter on which they have not always shown such enthusiasm. They should ask themselves in this matter whether their motives are entirely unmixed, and whether it is solely indignation at the destruction of British property or the risk to British lives that has moved them in this matter. From the very beginning of the Spanish conflict, the Opposition have offered the most persistent and sometimes embittered opposition to the whole policy of non-intervention—
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;24;That is perfectly wrong. The policy of non-intervention was accepted by the Labour movement until it was shown that it was absolutely one-sided. [Interruption.]
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;281;I was saying that the Opposition have from the beginning opposed the policy of non-intervention. The right hon. Gentleman says that that  is not so, and that there was a period during which they accepted it. All I can say is that it was very short, and, as time has gone on, they have made it clear that they object to the policy of nonintervention for the simple reason that their policy would be a policy of intervention. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] They cannot help viewing every question and every incident as it arises from this angle: "Does it or does it not help the side in which we are interested?" The right hon. Gentleman professed once again that he did not know what the policy of the Government was. We have made it, I think, sufficiently plain to ordinary people that our governing motive in this matter is not a preconceived feeling in favour of one side or the other. [An HON. MEMBER: "Ask Lennox-Boyd."] Our policy has been to try to preserve the greatest of British interests, namely, peace, and, all through, the object of the non-intervention policy has been to avoid what we conceive to be the inevitable result of intervention, namely, an extension of the conflict beyond the shores of Spain until it became a general European conflagration. That has been our aim all through. The right hon. Gentleman opposite said that it is his aim, too. Then all of us, since we have that aim in common, should take care that we are not diverted from that aim by any provocation, whether it comes from the benches opposite or whether it comes from attacks on British ships.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;110;After that warning was given, many shipowners abstained from carrying on trade with Spanish ports, although some of them had been in the habit of carrying it on before. Others disregarded the warning; and there were others, again, who were attracted by the high freights which are always associated with trade of that kind to enter into this trade. I do not know whether hon. Members happened to notice an article in the "Daily Herald" a little while ago, in which a considerable amount of space was devoted to the exploits of a certain Jack Albert Billmeir, who was described as the world's newest king. This is what it said: 
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;16;That is the description in the "Daily Herald." I do not know that it is witty.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;20;Wit is so often on the lips of the hon. Member that perhaps I may be forgiven. The article concludes: 
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;2;With whom?
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;205;—or take action which might conceivably involve us in war in order to give protection to people like this, who have gone, for purposes of making profits, into this risky trade, in spite of the warnings of His Majesty's Government. There have been, since the war began, a number of British subjects who have been themselves engaged in hostilities on one side or the other. Some have not been engaged in hostilities at all, but they have been engaged in medical work or ambulance work, which is very necessary for military operations, if it is not a military operation itself, just as supplies of coal or wheat or oil are necessary to maintain military operations although they are not military operations themselves. In pursuit of this work, these men that I speak of have run risks, not for profit—they went to fight for principles in which they believed so intensely that they actually decided to go and strike a blow for them themselves—a very honourable thing. Many of them have been killed, but I have not heard any protest from the other side, or any of these demands that the British Government should involve the British people in the risk of war on their behalf.

I say that that is the way to start a new European war.  That is the view of the country in general. We have the responsibility—it does not now rest on the right hon. Gentleman—and we are not going to take the risk. I want to know whether the right hon. Gentleman is advocating the bombing of aerodromes in Majorca or not?
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;89;I have to take these things on information given by the Government. The Government have told us that these are entirely Franco planes. When the Prime Minister wants to deal with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Carnarvon Boroughs (Mr. Lloyd George) he says that they are Italian planes and that that might involve us in the risk of war. He cannot have it both ways. If he will make a plain statement and put his cards on the table I will tell him what we would do.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;50;If there is any doubt I will attempt to clarify my statement. It remains to be seen whether the right hon. Gentleman will follow that up by putting his cards on the table. He says that he would not go to war with Italy, but that he would with Franco.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;93;I never said anything of the sort. I will tell the right hon. Gentleman. There is a risk of a general war. I pointed out that, if as a matter of fact this was merely General Franco, there could not be a risk of a general war; and I have stated my opinion that the blockading of Majorca—because aeroplanes, after all, have to have oil, and there is no oil in Majorca—would be an effective measure to stop this bombing. I do not believe that General Franco would declare war on Great Britain.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;163;I am satisfied from that statement that the right hon. Gentleman is prepared to take warlike action against General Franco in the sure belief that it would stop there. Can any responsible Member of this House think that it is safe to rely upon such a hypothesis as that? In the course of the Debate on Tuesday last I listened with great interest to a speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys), in the course of which he examined very carefully a possible course of action. He asked that his proposals should be considered sympathetically, and I must say I thought that that was not an unreasonable request, put forward in the way that they were and in view of the  arguments which my hon. Friend used. What did my hon. Friend wish to do? He said that he did not propose that we should bomb areodromes in Majorca, but he did wish that we should not exclude retaliation.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;314;Well, reprisals. I do not distinguish between the two. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"] If there is a distinction, let us call it reprisals. He agreed that it was not possible to take serious exception to the case of a ship lying alongside a wharf which could not easily be distinguished by an aeroplane flying at a great height from the adjoining town. In the case of ships lying away from the wharves, in the roads or in the harbours, if a deliberate attack was made, and especially where machine gunning was employed, then, he said, action could be taken. What was the action that he proposed? "I will demand compensation not at the end of the war, but now." That could be done, of course. But supposing compensation were refused or not paid, we are back again in the old difficulty, and my hon. Friend quite saw that, because he said emphatically that he would have us resort to reprisals. That is to me the most interesting part of his speech, because I wondered whether there were reprisals which he had in mind which had not occurred to the Government, and he suggested reprisals of one of two kinds—either the seizing of a ship belonging to General Franco, or the impounding of property belonging to General Franco whether in the form of goods, or money, or securities. I am glad that he did not include in his reprisals the suggestion that we should send a warship to bombard a port in the possession of General Franco. That was the form of reprisal which was adopted by the Germans after their battleship was bombed, but the criticism made upon it at the time was that it was punishing the wrong people, and that is the criticism which we should make on similar action being taken to-day by whomsoever it was taken. Therefore, that is ruled out.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;232;It is, therefore, perfectly obvious that it would be very easy for General Franco to retaliate in kind to a greater extent than our original action, and we should be forced back again to the old position. Of course, it is always in our power to take action. We are a strong Power and General Franco is a weak one, and if we were prepared to use our force against Franco, then that would be a different matter altogether. But then we are back again in the same dilemma. If we started warlike action, whether it were against General Franco or against some objective of which the ownership was doubtful, who could tell that we could stop our operations there, and it might be the beginning of another European war. The British Government have always made a distinction between attacks on British ships which might be called accidental inasmuch as the ships were near some military objective and that a hostile aeroplane, aiming at that military objective, might unwittingly involve a British ship in the attack—we make a distinction between that kind of attack and an attack deliberately aimed at a British vessel. There have been a number of cases, as I stated on a previous occasion, when all the evidence seemed to us to make it clear that those attacks were deliberate. In such cases we have made the strongest protests—
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;165;—and we have, of course, reserved our right to compensation. But, on the other hand, General Franco has in the most emphatic terms denied to us that he ever had any intention of deliberately attacking British ships, and that such action—[interruption].Perhaps I may be allowed to  make my statement. Hon. Members opposite really cannot expect to have uninterrupted opportunities of speaking if they are going to continue in this way. The Burgos authorities have stated that any such action would be entirely inconsistent with their desire, which they have often affirmed, to maintain friendly relations with His Majesty's Government. It may be remembered that in my statement on the 13th of this month I said, what was quite obvious, that it was impossible that attacks, frequently involving loss of life and sometimes apparently deliberate, on British ships, could be repeated without serious injury to the friendly relations which the Burgos authorities said they wished to have with us. I should like to repeat that warning.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;21;I should like the right hon. Gentleman to explain in more detail his proposal in regard to anti-aircraft guns for ships.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;54;I have made no proposal. I did not make any proposal  in regard to anti-aircraft guns, I said that was a matter for the owners and not for the Government. If the right hon. Gentleman is asking whether the British Government are prepared to issue arms to merchant vessels, the answer is, definitely, no.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;36;That is not the point. The hon. and gallant Member for Clitheroe (Sir W. Brass) asked whether these ships could be provided with them, and the right hon. Gentleman said, no, they must provide them themselves.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;9;I said it was a matter for the owners.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;13;Are the Government going to give any facilities, having thrown out that suggestion?
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;149;No, I am not sure that the right hon. Gentleman did not put his finger on the important point when he asked whether it was possible, in view of the non-intervention arrangement, for these vessels to arm. I am endeavouring to sum up the position of the Government, and I say once again that we are not going to change the policy which we have announced to the House and the country with regard to Spain. We believe that that is the right and proper course in the best interests of the country. We believe that that is the course the country desires us to take. We believe that if British ships still continue to go into territorial waters for the purpose of making these high profits, they must take the risk and they must not seek to throw upon others responsibilities which we are not willing to undertake.
1938-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-23;Bombing Of British Ships;202;I should always differ from my hon. Friend the Member for the neighbouring division of South-East Essex (Mr. Raikes) with much reluctance, because my hon. Friend and I have cooperated and collaborated in other Parliaments and on other topics, and it certainly could not be suggested of him that he does not form his own opinions irrespective of party pressure, or even of constituency pressure. He forms his own opinions, and he gives his counsel truly as he conceives it to be his duty to do. Therefore, I differ from him not only with personal reluctance but, on general grounds, with some anxiety. Nevertheless I do not think that my hon. Friend was well advised to point to the recent by-election as a sign that the people of this country were entirely upon the side of the foreign policy of which we are having another example to-day. If he would examine those by-elections carefully he would, I think, see that it would be better not to cite them as evidence of popular opinion, but in any case I do not think this matter, which is so very grave, should be settled by reference to the fortuitous incidents and accidents of by-election contests.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);139;The right hon. Gentle man is very prudent in not endeavouring to inform us of the actual words, which he undoubtedly did use, and which were of so sanguine a nature as to give the impression that he was jumping at office like a dog at a bone. "Five million houses in quick time," was the promise of the Foreign Secretary. Let us see what progress there is to report. Until the German war was over and the builders were released, no Government could have produced any substantial number of completed permanent houses. We should, however, have expected to see by now signs of permanent house building start-  ing up on an appreciable scale through out the country, whereas, as every one knows, it is still a very rare event to see a permanent house in course of construction.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);200;The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition opened today on a quiet note of injured innocence. We were the people, according to him, who had driven this public-spirited Opposition into putting down a Motion of Censure, we were the people who had driven a wedge between the parties in the State. I have not forgotten the right hon. Gentleman's broadcast at the beginning of the Election, nor have the people of this country.  That was when any partisan tone was introduced, and I have also had the plea sure of reading the right hon. Gentleman's speech the other day to his party. It was a very different style of speech from that which we have had this after noon. The burden of the right hon. Gentleman's speech is this: He said: Why, when you were elected to carry out a Socialist programme, did you not carry out a Conservative programme? To the right hon. Gentleman everything that is Conservative is normal, anything that sees a changing world and wishes to change it must be wrong. We are always asked to rally round, to be patriotic and keep things as they are. We were not returned for that purpose.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);22;We are glad to hear that quite clearly. We do not drop from 12,000 to 9,000 at the end of the year?

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);39;Yes. I am pointing out to the House that at the present we are doing better, very much better, 12,000 against 10,000, than what he said he did. What was the position at the end of the last war?
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);9;I think I was responsible for the Army alone.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);189;I do not think so. The men there were much more easily brought across. They were only just across on the Continent. The difficulties of shipping were nothing like what they are today. I claim, therefore, that this is very largely a stunt. In the same way, Class B releases were difficult. The right hon. Gentleman found at the end of the last war how difficult it is to have special releases for special men without upsetting the rest. We have been working on that principle, the application of which has been improved. The right hon. Gentleman rather sneered that we had managed to alter things. After all, we have to watch events and see how they move, shipping changes and the like. There has been a constant acceleration of the demobilisation programme; it has been stepped up, and it is being stepped up again today. In the same way, Class B releases were largely held back through the unwillingness of the men to accept it, but conditions have now been made better, and the releases are actually today between 10 percent. and 15 percent. of the Class A.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);142;:It is difficult to answer in a few words. There is great difference in the situation now and the one which we had after the last war. After the last war we had no people East of Suez, but we had great problems too in one sphere. What has come to be a great difficulty in the present situation is that we have a comparatively small number of men far off beyond Suez in the East, and that is holding up an otherwise perfectly normal rate of discharge which would be possible in all the other theatres. [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer."] The new question is, how far is it possible to release those from the nearer theatres— [HON. MEMBERS: "Answer "]—and how long must great numbers be kept waiting about, because of the great difficulty of releasing a very few from the distance?
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);101;:The right hon. Gentleman has pointed out that conditions have changed, because the Japanese war has come to an end, but this position, which was adopted by the late Government, was under the general idea that the Japanese war would continue and that you would have people there and you would have people at home; yet that position was strongly put by the right hon. Gentleman about the morale of the men, and that we must maintain it. Believe me, the need for keeping up the morale of men who are scattered all over Asia and elsewhere is just as strong.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);7;It is all a question of proportion.
1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);101;:And then the question is as to shipping. It is easy to say there are ships. We have scoured the place for ships. We have managed to speed it up. The right hon. Gentle man knows that demobilisation is not just a question of pulling out men here and there. You have to think of the efficiency of the units when rapidly taking away all the older men and all the rest of it. I do not need to tell the right hon. Gentle man that it is not an easy process and therefore people should not talk lightly about it.

1945-6-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-6-12;Government Policy (Motion Of Censure);285;Yes—by setting free at an early date millions of men and women now kept in unemployment. I should like to know whether there is any basis for that figure. Any one can say ££ 800,000,000, or even £1,600,000,000, but where does it come from? Was it given to him by the distinguished physicist who supplies him with economic information? I would ask whether, in rendering that figure, he has taken into account all the additional expenditure which arises on the  termination of a war. Let us look at the facts. Demobilisation charges do not stop directly men are demobilised. There is leave of eight weeks, plus foreign service leave, during which they draw pay and allowances. They are paid their war gratuities. Does he want to cut that off, out of the £800,000,000? This is actually an increase in expenditure, and for the Army alone this amounts to£100,000,000 in the current year. You cannot escape that. As regards munitions, despite substantial progress payments, when a con tract is terminated, arrears of payment fall due, and that is a very large item. Then we have the cost of a very large haul of prisoners—he has forgotten that. There is requisitioned property, which when vacated involves heavy compensation. There is Lend-Lease, which ceased at the end of the war. For food alone there is an additional charge of £150,000,000, as the direct consequence of the termination of hostilities. This is not all, as the right hon. Gentleman said, paying people for doing nothing. They are putting up houses and factories in the development areas, for returning Servicemen. All those things are of the nature of capital investment by the community. I dare say these were not noticed.

I may say he got it through with the help of a Socialist who was leading the Labour side of the Com-  mittee upstairs, and myself. And now gas; here we have the report of the Heyworth Committee on gas. The people who were on that committee, I may say, were not Socialist nominees. The Minister was not a Socialist.

1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);48;With great respect I submit that this is a question of foreign intervention, a question of whether there is a blockade or not and of whether this country is not, in effect, intervening by acting on behalf of General Franco. But I will not pursue that subject further.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);104;Oh, yes, foreign intervention as regards Spain. We are foreigners in regard to Spain. We have had the same policy followed out. If you look at the outline of the proposals you will find, on page 4 of the White Paper, that the system of supervision on the land frontier will be restored at once—the land frontier which we have kept all the time against the Spanish Government. It is admitted that for a long time General Franco has had the stronger force at sea; in fact, opening the sea and closing the land has made all the time in favour of General Franco.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);30;I do not think any hon. Member on the other side will disagree with me when I say that General Franco has not managed to raise a great national army.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);175;Let us look at the other side. The Spanish Government have been deprived of their arms and of their arsenals. They had very scanty munitions and very few skilled instructors, but the fighting has been kept up for more than a year, and there are now very large armies —trained and organised armies. I take those facts not from one side or  the other. They are very fine armies, up to the number of hundreds of thousands capable of taking the field. I claim that if General Franco had been able to raise enough Spanish forces to fight, he would not have wanted to be indebted to Germany and Italy for troops. The Spaniards would not like to have their battles fought by somebody else. Therefore the continued importations of foreign troops and the continued calls for more are pretty fair indications that General Franco has not the support of the people of Spain, even in the parts which are under his authority. It is obvious that without this foreign support General Franco would collapse.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);44;The right hon. Gentleman has entirely misunderstood the argument. The specific point that I put was that, as he was supported by and dependent on foreign troops, he had clearly shown that he was not supported by a substantial portion of the Spanish people.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);194;I was glad to find myself coming more and more into agreement with the right hon. Gentleman as his speech proceeded. It is a matter of value and importance, extending far outside this House, that the party which he leads, and which plays such a very large part in moulding opinion in the country, should definitely range itself upon this issue at the side of His Majesty's Government. But I must confess that what has weighed with me a good deal in  these last few weeks was what the right hon. Gentleman a little tried to discount. I have felt it to be a most remarkable thing that when, on the London Committee, there was a definite difference, a distinct divergence, between the great Powers, and when the whole committee was summoned together, it was asserted broadly, and I believe truly, that no fewer than 23 out of those 27 Powers, if matters had been forced to a division, which happily they were not, would have followed the lead of the two great Western democracies, Great Britain and France. I think that is a tremendous event, and, believe me, it adds to our safety.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);184;As to this plan which has been put forward, I was very glad to hear the lucid defence of certain intricate points put forward by the right hon. Gentleman. Of course it is a compromise. It is a compromise between not only divergent but vehemently antagonistic views and interests. You cannot expect to find an attractive, symmetrical, clear-cut proposal such as would spring in its integrity from one man's mind,  when you have to cater for no fewer than 27 different nations. I have not the slightest doubt there are points in this plan which are extremely repugnant to Germany and Italy, but then, I imagine, there are also points in it which are repugnant to Soviet Russia, and there are some points which, perhaps, are not entirely in accord with the views of France. But if we are to keep the whole of these Powers together round the table, it is absolutely necessary for everybody to put up with a certain amount which they do not like, for the sake of producing a scheme upon which all may be able, possibly, to agree.
1937-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-15;Spain (Non-Intervention Proposals);12;I believe that that is playing a great part on both sides.

Friend was explaining the necessity for our defences,  and for increasing the defences of the freedom loving nations. It is perfectly relevant to suggest to people that our whole end is peace and that we do not want to spend all our efforts in piling up armaments. I would say that, when there is a genuine acceptance of the need for peace and genuine co-operation by others, we shall certainly join in. I think that it was a perfectly reasonable and sensible thing to say.

I do not think that anyone thinks so but the right hon. Gentleman. I flung no insinuations. I was pointing out, and I thought the right hon. Gentleman agreed, that we are increasing our defences for the purpose of preserving peace. I think that a statement of this kind is quite useful, because there are people who think that because we are piling up defences we are solely interested in piling up defences to make war. It is just as well to counter that kind of propaganda.

I might here confess to the House another case when the field marshal also wore his uniform at the Trooping the Colour.

The sudden removal of these able and resolute men from the centre and summit of war direction in Australia inflicts an injury upon us all which I can be at no pains to conceal. In Brigadier Street and Mr. Fairbairn, in Sir Henry Gullett and Lieut.-General Sir Brudenell White, Australia has been robbed of some of her best and ablest sons at a moment when the gifts they had to offer were most precious. The House will wish to extend its sympathy to their families and friends, and to the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, whose burden is already heavy enough.  In so doing, we shall give voice to the sorrow which in so many lands will be felt by all to whom the cause of freedom is dear. In this hour of battle there will be one other thought, equally spontaneous and equally widespread—Close the ranks, and carry on.

I think it is in the general interest and in the interests of the House, and also in the interests of the late Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the facts of this matter shall be put upon record by a responsible Committee in such a way as to put an end to any slanderous rumours which may be in circulation.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);21;I understand that such a Motion is debatable and I should like to consider it when it is definitely put down.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);30;No, Sir. The Government considered this matter, and the position they have taken up is that if there is a demand for an inquiry the Government will not oppose it.
1947-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-11-17;Budget Disclosure (Motion);26;There is a formal demand for the inquiry from the Opposition, and I believe that the demand is also supported by the party below the Gangway.

Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs made a statement on the subject of this loan agreement on 10th April last. The agreement will be laid as a White Paper. It would not be a good thing to debate it—just now—certainly not in public.
1941-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-4-22;Spain (British Loan);52;Many people thought in July of last year that Spain would enter the war against us, and I think that it is very largely due to the brilliant discharge of his duties in Spain that our relations with that country have tended to improve and not to deteriorate at this critical time.
1941-4-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-4-22;Spain (British Loan);122;I do not know what is meant by the last remark about another fait accompli at all. This policy has been most carefully considered, and the state of our affairs in every part of the world does not allow matters of this kind to be handled in a rough and reckless or debonair fashion. We do not wish to do anything which would give any excuse for a breach at the present time between us and the Spanish Government; and I certainly consider that the starving condition of the people of Spain fully justifies assistance being given by Great Britain, and by the United States, if she chooses so to act, irrespective of whether any expressions of gratitude are forthcoming or not.

1951-10-04-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-10-04;The King's Illness;71;I associate myself and those who sit on this side of the House fully with the well chosen words which the Prime Minister has just used. We have all felt a very great and prolonged sense of anxiety since the full extent of the serious illness of His Majesty was made known; and he has certainly had the prayers of all his subjects in the ordeals through which he has passed.

I must be understood to be making no promise of any kind at a time when we consider our actions are in dispute.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);37;I never said anything of the sort.

1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);76;This is one of the exceptional occasions when the Prerogative of the Crown comes into play and where in doubtful circumstances the Crown would refer to other advisers. It has been done on several occasions. I must make it absolutely clear that it does not rest with the Government of the day. It would be most improper on my part to use any language which suggested that I have the power to make such a decision.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Question Of Confidence);50;The Government have accepted, I am told, 50 or 60 Amendments. The whole Bill is being shaped as it goes along. The reason that this difficulty arose was that something much bigger and extraneous was tacked on. That s the answer to my hon. Friend, whom I respect so much.
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;25;(by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he has any statement to make on negotiations between this country and Egypt.
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;16;Will this report be made to the House before definite decisions have been taken or after?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;64;I ventured to say the other day that the House has not claimed to interfere with the treaty-making power of the Government. What does the right hon. Gentleman then mean by "full and proper rights"? Would we be safe in assuming that he will endeavour to carry the House with him before he commits himself to a definite decision on so grave a matter?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;121;Does not this amount to the fact that we are to be told nothing about this matter until a decision is taken definitely one way or the other, which may perhaps involve the immediate or early withdrawal of British troops from the Suez Canal Zone with all the consequences that that entails in the Middle East and beyond? If that is the position, are we not bound on this side of the House to initiate a debate upon the matter and make sure that the House has an opportunity of bringing home to the Government its opinion about the state of affairs in the Levant and in Egypt about which there is a great deal of anxiety at the present time?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;79;Is not the right hon. Gentleman avoiding the point? According to what he said, the rights of Parliament would be fully preserved in that after he has taken decisions and made agreements which Parliament could not alter without a breach of our traditions and customs, and only after, we are allowed an opportunity of debating the matter. Would it not be wiser and better, as the Treaty does not end until 1956, for us to discuss this matter beforehand?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;51;That is very important. If it is understood that no agreement which is now being made will have validity until the House has had an opportunity of discussing it, which is what I understood the right hon. Gentleman to say, I shall press the matter no further. Is that the position?
1951-4-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-11;Anglo-Egyptian Discussions;79;Is it not clear that the Hoare-Laval Agreement was not a treaty? Is it not also clear that the right hon. Gentleman does not mean as a general rule to abrogate the treaty-making rights of the Executive under the Crown? Is it not also clear that he is making an exception in this case by making any provisional agreement which may be reached between him and the Egyptian authorities a matter which will require the approval of the House?
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;204;It is my pleasant duty to congratulate the two hon. Members who have moved and seconded the Address. It always seems to me that these Members are given an extremely difficult task, and yet every year we find Members who are able to carry it out with distinction. This year, I think, the hon. Members have had a more than usually difficult task, because they were trying to make bricks without straw, and, if they did not make any they certainly did not drop any. I could not help but admire the wit and the tact of the hon. Mover. We all enjoyed his wit. I am sure that we all noticed his tact, because he alluded extremely little to what was in the Gracious Speech. The hon. Seconder skimmed rather rapidly over it and had one flight of imagination; and I congratulate him, too, on his tact. In truth, there is not very much in this programme which the Government are putting before the House. I would like to ask one question before making some remarks about it. Perhaps the Prime Minister will tell us when we shall receive the report on Palestine and when we shall have a Debate on that subject.
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;224;I well recollect that when I first became a Member of this House as a young fellow of 50 I was overawed at first by my surroundings. I remember one particular nightmare which used to obsess me in my early years, and that was lest I should be invited to move or second  the Address to the Throne, a task which I was quite convinced was entirely beyond my powers. Fortunately, those in authority thought so, too. I was not asked, and I do not suppose I ever shall be asked now, to do so, but the consequence is that I have been able to enjoy over a long period listening, without any fear of comparison, to a succession of brilliant performances by those who have undertaken this peculiarly difficult and delicate task. We have been accustomed in the past to a very high standard on these occasions; I agree with the right hon. Gentleman opposite that we can congratulate my two hon. Friends who have moved and seconded the Address in that they have in no way lowered the high level of the speeches. Both the speeches to which we have listened this afternoon presented just that happy combination of sound common sense, shrewd phrasing, sharp wit and delicate humour which is what we look for in speeches in such times as these.
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;51;That will make a very short day. In addition to that there are Bills, which will reduce the time still more, and many hon. Members will want to attend Armistice services in their own constituencies. I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman will consider it worth while taking any other business.
1938-11-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-11-08;Debate On The Address;30;That is a matter which will require consideration; but I shall be very happy to take it into consideration, and communicate with the right hon. Gentleman through the usual channels.

1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);23;(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make on the development of the atom bomb by Russia.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);28;No, Sir. I do not think that it would be in the public interest to make any further statement at present beyond the announcement made on 23rd September.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);65;In reply to the first question, that is answered in the announcement made on 23rd September. The second question I do not think really arises. On the third question, we have already declared our policy. The matter is being discussed in America in the United Nations meeting and we made perfectly clear our policy that we believe there should be international control of atomic energy.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);25;The right hon. Gentleman, I presume, would be agreeable to this matter being discussed at some convenient time when we reassemble in a little while?
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);17;It on reflection it was considered useful, I should certainly be prepared to give that full consideration.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);30;The matter and the attitudes of the various Governments concerned have been fully expressed. Great progress would be made if the Government of Soviet Russia would agree to international inspection.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);37;The question of the atom weapon falls into its place with other considerations but, as I am advised, the fact of the existence of the atom bomb does not necessarily mean that all other weapons are obsolete.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);45;I am not prepared to give a reply of that kind. In this question we are working closely with the United States of America and with Canada. Obviously, the question of what disclosures of information are made must be a matter for consideration between Governments.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);8;I was dealing with the point of inspection.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);20;I think that is an entirely different question. What hours a scientist can effectively work is a matter for consideration.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);13;I am not prepared to give any further information at Late present moment.
1949-9-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-9-27;Atomic Energy (Soviet Union);23;Yes, I quite agree, but the whole point is that there are only certain countries where the people can make their voices effective.
1943-4-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-15;War Pensions;139;I should not be justified in placing upon this House and on my right hon. Friend the Minister of Pensions the very heavy burden which would inevitably result from the appointment of a Select Committee unless the main principles of the war pensions system were the subject of serious controversy. Such questions as have been raised in Debate or otherwise do not affect essential principles but are rather concerned with matters which fall properly within the scope of existing machinery. I understand that my right hon. Friend has already brought a number of these questions before his Central Advisory Committee, on which the various parties in this House are well represented, and that others are being put down for discussion at future meetings. This procedure is likely to be much more expeditious than the deliberations of a Select Committee.

The three great Powers are in entire agreement upon the general aims which bind our alliance and we have every need to keep in the closest association in this dangerous and momentous phase of the war.
1944-12-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-20;Greece (Situation);14;That is a topic with which, obviously, I should not attempt to deal now.

I have not the slightest doubt that effective co-operation will go on, in all aspects of the war. We had a certain task thrown upon us, and we are discharging it to the best of our ability.
1944-12-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-20;Greece (Situation);14;I think it would certainly be a justifiable conclusion to form at this stage.

Two unidentified bodies of unknown nationality which were washed ashore on 14th February and 6th March respectively were buried by the local civil authorities in accordance with the usual practice. The naval authorities always endeavour to provide proper funeral ceremonies for British naval personnel who lose their lives at sea, and I am asking that during the war this practice shall be extended as widely as possible to cover the kind of case the hon. Member has in mind.
1940-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-20;Seamen's Funerals;18;I am glad that the hon. Member put the Question down. It is certainly one which requires attention.
1940-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-20;Seamen's Funerals;99;Yes, Sir. I intended my reply to apply not only to the regular personnel of the Navy, but to the large number of British seamen who are risking their lives every day in the North Sea in essential measures for our protection. I cannot guarantee that there will be available at every port and at all times a naval firing party, but we will do the best we can to make it available for all these cases which the hon. Member has in mind. May I express my obligation that the matter has been brought forward in this way?

1941-10-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-10-16;Select Committee On National Expenditure;110;Yes, Sir. Not only will I give my continuing attention to this matter, but, in view of the responsibilities which Parliament has laid upon me in respect of Memoranda from the Select Committee, I read the Memorandum myself within five days of its being sent forward in August, and minuted it immediately to the Departments concerned, requesting their consideration and action. As a result of the reports which I received, I came to the conclusion that the Sub-committee were not fully informed upon the operational aspects of the questions raised, nor upon the wider questions of policy, and that it would not be wise to follow the course they recommended.
1941-10-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-10-16;Select Committee On National Expenditure;83;Each case must be judged as it arises, and, as it is well known, up to the present that aspect has not been brought before the Committee. But in respect of this particular case, it seems to me that the matter could not be fully apprehended without that side being brought in, and in view, as I say, of the very proper interest which the House has taken in the matter, I propose that the practice shall be waived in this particular instance.

Member, were considered. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition announced on 19th June, 1946, that the King had approved a recommendation that Remembrance Sunday should be celebrated on the Sunday before 11th November, unless 11th or 12th November be a Sunday. Her Majesty's Government have no intention of making any change now.

1941-2-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-2-27;House Of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Bill;354;Surely, the House is not going to shelter behind party leaders; surely, the right hon. Member will not try to get behind such a poor little ill-filled sandbag as that. Now that I have shown hon. Members the camel they have already swallowed, I hope they will address themselves with renewed sense of proportion to this somewhat inconsiderable gnat. An office of profit is, in my view—I do not speak as a lawyer—a term of art. It applies to many positions where there is no remuneration. A Junior Lord of the Treasury, unpaid, is an office of profit, but a special mission, though it may be very highly paid and may last for years, is not a disqualifying office of profit. A foreign Embassy, even though, as in the case of the right hon. and learned Member for East Bristol (Sir S. Cripps), it is a formal, definite, diplomatic appointment, and not a special mission in any sense, has, according to the advice we have received, been held not to disqualify as an office of profit. That advice has not been challenged, or has not yet been challenged, by the House or by the common informer. [An HON. MEMBER: "He takes no salary."] That has nothing to do with it. That is one of the anomalies I am trying to bring out. It would make no difference if the right hon. and learned Member took a salary. He  takes the fees of representation necessary to the discharge of these important duties. Even though it is a formal appointhment, it has not been challenged, though I must say I should have thought it was a very doubtful case. If an office was in existence before 1705, it may be held by a Member of Parliament and profit drawn from it unless, of course, it comes under a special ban in some later Statutes, which are numerous and obscure. The High Commissionership of one of our great Dominions, not having been in existence in 1705, thus disqualifies, whereas an Embassy to a foreign country does not. I am only putting it forward to show the anomalies.
1941-2-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-2-27;House Of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Bill;134;I will deal with all the facets of the argument in turn. I am assured that my hon. Friend the Member for Edgbaston might on the action of a common informer be mulcted in financial penalties, or upon a Motion in this House his election might be declared null and void. My hon. Friend is not alone. The hon. and gallant Member for Ormskirk (Commander King-Hall) and the hon. Member for Rotherhithe (Mr. Benjamin Smith) are equally in this dangerous area, but worse may come. There may be a good many more fish in the net. My right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Burton, in his comfortable, secure position in that constituency, has not realised that not everyone is in that position of impeccable political stability which he has so long enjoyed.

That is the answer I give to the hon. Gentleman, and if he will not reproach me with an endeavour to suborn him, I can only say that the roll is not necessarily complete. Many things have yet to happen. This White Paper records a process reached naturally and even inevitably under the conditions of these tremendous and terrible times, and which, while it serves the interest of the nation at war, dignifies and enhances the character and quality of Parliamentary representation.

Gentleman the Member for West Islington (Mr. Montague) who asked that we might have a chairman who was less politically compromised.
1938-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-16;Civil Aviation;30;I was referring to the fact that the Prime Minister overlooked the point that when he originally set up the committee, it did not satisfy hon. Members on this side.
1938-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-16;Civil Aviation;36;The right hon. Gentleman will, no doubt, remember that the hon.

1938-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-16;Civil Aviation;153;I am not associating myself with that remark. In fact I do not. The Prime Minister has concentrated on that, but he has forgotten that he set up a committee which consisted, in the view of the rest of the House, of what you might call "Yes men." I think it is perfectly clear, in view of the emphatic terms of the report that we could not have expected to get a full and impartial report from persons in Government service. The report is a vindication of the rights of this House to operate through inquiry. That has been done on many occasions. The Prime Minister is wrong if he thinks that these inquiries do not occur when grave events are proceeding. There was a famous committee of inquiry into the Crimean War, and an interesting speech was made by Lord John Russell, who resigned when the Motion was put down. He said: 
1938-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-16;Civil Aviation;2;And worked.

If you are going to make all these changes, I suggest in the first place that the Secretary of State ought to be changed. I suggest also that in view of the extreme condemnation of the people who are running Imperial Airways there should be a change in the management. They have been subject to pretty severe condemnation. The report says:

Steps are also being taken to make substantial additions to the strength and preparedness of Anti-Aircraft Command.

In 1949 restrictions on the export of goods of strategic importance were increased, as announced to the House in February, 1949; but they were not applied to contracts placed before the new arrangements came into force. Some of the goods take a long time to produce, and some orders placed before that date have not yet been completed. These restrictions have been kept under constant review, in consultation with friendly Powers, and during the past few weeks we have been re-examining the whole matter in the light of the international situation and of our own needs.

I am not sure, but I am told they are for Poland. [Laughter.] It does not make any difference whatever except this—if hon. Members wait for one moment. As a matter of fact, what we are sending to Poland is subject to a particular agree-  ment. The terms of that agreement have to be looked at very closely. It is not exactly on the same level. It does make a difference what exactly the terms are. We are looking at them and if we need that boring machine, it will be retained in this country; but, as a matter of fact, it is not due for completion for some months yet. We are looking very fully into that. [An HON. MEMBER: "Why not have looked before now?"] We have not the information on everything that has been ordered long ahead. If, however, there are any other points on that, I am sure my right hon. Friend will be pleased to answer specific points. Perhaps it would come better in the course of the Debate than at the end of what I am afraid has been an unduly long speech.
1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);58;I am afraid that I have not that date with me. I did explain in a broadcast that the original request was that we should send a balanced force, and stress was not laid on sending them immediately; but, subsequently, we  had an urgent request to which we at once responded by sending a force from Hong Kong.
1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);85;It certainly was a great surprise to me, and I am sure also to my right hon. Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington (Mr. Eden) and to the Leader of the Liberal Party. [Interruption.] I hope that members of the Liberal Party all over the country will take note of that cry of derision. No one counts at all except those who are managed by the Labour caucus; no one else counts at all, yet they come forward appealing for national support and unity.

1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);77;The right hon. Gentleman has more experience in conducting military affairs than anyone in this House. He has been accustomed, no doubt, to receiving advice from those who are responsible for running a campaign. The campaign in Korea is being run by the Americans. We respond to their requests, and if the request changes from what it was before, it is not the fault of His Majesty's Government. We have responded to the request made to us.
1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);63;No, Sir. I do not feel that that is so. [HON.

I do not mind noise in the least. Please go on, although we  gave the Prime Minister a very silent and patient hearing.

1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);98;What I said was that the machinery and tools were being delivered in respect of contracts already entered into, and the statement made in 1949—I think in February—by the President of the Board of Trade to this House was that that was the practice we were following. I did not say that if at the present time we required these we should not step in and take them over. I was referring to what the practice was then. As a matter of fact, a whole lot of trading goes on which is outside the control of the Government.
1950-9-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-9-12;Defence (Government Proposals);89;It is very extraordinary that the right hon.

No, Sir, what I gathered from what the right hon. Gentleman said led me to preserve this particular phrase: "The matter is to be kept under continuous review."

1940-1-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The First Lord of the Admiralty (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-1-31;Admiralty (Appointments And Promotions);178;In the transition from peace co war it is necessary to make considerable temporary expansions of the Admiralty staff, as indeed of the staffs of ill other Services, and these cannot be filled even mainly from the permanent and pensionable staff. The normal promotion board machinery has been suspended for the period of the war, and in any case is not applicable to tem-  porary appointments and promotions. Mr. Chatfield is one among a considerable number of persons brought in to the Admiralty from outside as temporary administrative officers. The only difference I can discern between his case and that of the five other persons similarly appointed is that on the day before the outbreak of war he succeeded in obtaining an appointment as a temporary clerk. He had already served in the Royal Navy as a cadet and midshipman for three years before being invalided. Thereafter he had joined the Territorial Army and was again invalided. He therefore sought to serve in a clerical capacity, that being the only one which the state of his health permitted.

Gentleman, whose Question raised public issues of importance. I prepared the answer with my own hand, and I  do not mind saying that I was very well satisfied with it. If I were to attempt to embellish it at the moment, I should only spoil it.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;338;I gathered that it was the desire of the House that there should be a further discussion of the war and foreign situations and policies at this time, before any new important international conferences take place. I will try to survey the whole—I cannot say the whole, but large and select portions—of this vast scene to the best of my ability. It has fallen to the hard lot of Britain to play a leading part in the Mediterranean, and particularly in the Eastern Mediterranean. We have great responsibilities, and we have made great exertions, there. In Italy the British, or  British-controlled, divisions under Field Marshal Alexander's command, and still more if the whole area of the Mediterranean is included, outnumber three-fold those of the United States. There is battle along the whole front in Italy, and behind the front, in the hard-stricken peninsula, are many economic and political difficulties. The old structure with its hateful rigours has been destroyed, and in its place we have had to raise a Government of improvisation. We have the Bonomi Government, which has been trying to do its best under extraordinary difficulties, but which, of course, has no electoral authority behind it. But now, at any time, perhaps in a few months, perhaps much sooner—for no one can tell what is proceeding in the minds of the German war leaders—the Germans will be driven out of Italy, o will perhaps withdraw; and immediately the great populous districts of the North, the cities of Turin, Milan, and other centres of industry and activity, and a large population of all kinds of political views but containing great numbers of vehement or violent politicians, and in touch with brave men, who have been fighting, and maintaining a guerilla warfare in the Alps, all these will be thrown—probably at a time when the Northern regions have been stripped bare of food by the retreating Germans—hungry, upon the fragile structure of the Italian Government in Rome, with consequences which cannot be accurately foreseen, and certainly not measured.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;10;Well, I speak according to the best information I have.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;169;I have spared no pains to try to learn what I believe are the facts. I consider myself far better informed on this matter than I was a month or six weeks ago, but what I have learned with great pains and patience has led me to a strengthening of my original conclusions, and among them is undoubtedly the conclusion that the E.L.A.S. armed bands, at any rate for the last two years, played very little part against the Germans. Now, I really cannot argue with my hon. Friend. No doubt he and some of those who hold his views will have an opportunity of extolling their glorious deeds. I, personally, am not prepared to pay them anything like the tributes which are paid to the heroic French or Belgian Maquis, or to the men in Italy who are in the mountains fighting their desperate battle. It seems to me they took aid from us with their eyes on more important local matters after the general war was over.

Almost all the police stations in Athens and the Piraeus had been occupied or stormed by E.L.A.S. forces, some with the slaughter of every single inmate. Firing was widespread throughout the city—it was growing, it was approaching. General Scobie signalled:

1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;62;I am not accepting it at all as an absolute rule, that in time of war documents can be quoted without  the most careful survey by the Government.

I am reading the facts and he does not like the facts. I am telling him the truth and he fears the truth. These facts reflect on those whom he has so thoughtlessly championed, and I will give him further warning. There is a great deal more to come, and I think that the Committee has a right to hear it. [Interruption.] When I quote from the colonel of the King's Royal Rifle Corps and say he gathered his information from the advanced dressing station, where he examined a number of these victims, the hon. Gentleman opposite immediately tries to suggest it is all some fake propaganda. He did not use those words, but the whole sense of his interruption was to cast doubt on an officer who has not the slightest interest, political or otherwise, to do anything but collect, gather and convey the truth. Mr. Leeper adds: 
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;170;I think there is a great difference between putting people to death for the crime of rebellion, or bringing them to penal processes, and making sure that your Government Departments are not full of people who are working for the other side. I am dealing with the whole question of amnesty which relates to the penal processes of law, such as imprisonment or sentences of death, and an amnesty certainly does not mean that persons who are not trusted by the Government of the day will immediately be made Cabinet Ministers, or that employees who were found to have left their posts in the crisis and taken part in the fighting on the opposite side to the Government of the day, should be reinstated or left in their positions. No one can stand for that, and I want to be very careful not to lead the hon. Gentleman the Member for Ebbw Vale into any ideas that I am promising something that goes beyond the actual words I have used.

General Scobie has throughout been in a quasi-political position, in the closest negotiations with all the different quarters. He has not been simply a military commander charged purely with the application or non-application of military force.

1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;213;I want to make a short intervention in this Debate in reply to some of the points that have been made, and try to make plain what, in my opinion, are the broad facts of the situation. The whole of this Greek question has got involved in an atmosphere of emotion. It is quite understandable but it is quite inimical to our getting a clear view. We in the Government have to deal with these foreign situations in the light of the facts as known to us. We take every opportunity We can to exercise our utmost vigilance, to try to arrive at these facts. Let me say at once it is not always easy for anyone to get the whole of the facts when dealing with a foreign country, a country which has only just been cleared of a foreign invader, a country that was for a long time under a dictatorship. It is not at all easy in such cases to get the exact facts about what happened. It is not very easy to sum up  the various personalities, particularly when their names are often like each other and one is not always sure which is which. It is not at all easy to judge the exact state of public opinion.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;92;That is exactly the point I am making. We give these matters our very close attention. Let me say here, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Cocks), that the foreign policy of this Government is not a matter that is left to the impulse of a Prime Minister or to the sole discretion of a Foreign Secretary. These matters are debated and discussed very fully in Cabinet. I can assure him we have endless discussions. Therefore we do try to arrive at an opinion on the facts.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;150;My hon. Friend gave a long list. The Foreign Secretary will be replying to-morrow. My hon. Friend gave us rather a long history. I can tell him straight away that there are a great many instances on which he was completely mistaken. I would ask him to think that on these matters I am as desirous as he is of seeing that the truth shall prevail and that we shall support the principles we hold in common. I would not like him, therefore, to assume always that the word of a Greek, or the word of Mr. Drew Pearson, is better than the word of His Majesty's Ministers. We are all, of course, subject to temptation in this matter. We all tend to lend credence to something which seems to support our own point of view. Otherwise, I am quite sure my hon. Friend would not have quoted Drew Pearson.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;45;In matters of foreign policy this habit is increased by the practice of dividing the world up into Right and Left. To many people everything that comes from the Left is suspect, and to others everything that is done by the Left must be supported.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;137;The point my hon. Friend is making is not a very good one. I am saying that is a habit of all of us. I know people who think that all people who may disagree with them are Bolsheviks. I  sometimes think that the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) thinks that everyone who does not agree with him is a Fascist. But, as a matter of fact, when one comes to Right and Left, people of very different views are grouped together under these very wide umbrellas. I think, as my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe pointed out so well, that was the case with E.A.M. It is quite a mistake to think that E.A.M. consisted of one lot of people—of Communists. It consisted of Liberals, Socialists and Communists, people of varied political views.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;81;I am afraid the hon. Member will find that he did if he will look at the report in HANSARD of what he said. He talked of this British Government coming in to support one side against the other. The point is that we came into Greece for a Government of all parties, Socialists and all the rest. We must get that right. It is a mistake to try to lump all people together as Right or Left, and to suggest——
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;6;I am not giving way. [Interruption.]
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;19;I am making my own speech now. The hon. Member need not talk about what the Prime Minister says.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;348;I do not agree with my hon. Friend's translation of what the Prime Minister said. As I was saying, it is a mistake to try to lump people together like this, and to be deflected from principles by imagining that some people are all Right and some people all Left, particularly in South-Eastern Europe. When you are dealing with people like the Greeks, who are rather temperamental perhaps, and with countries which, like those of South-Eastern Europe, have had a very short experience of the working of democratic institutions, you should never try to judge them exactly on our own basis. Therefore, you should try to get quite clear in your mind what your principle is. I do not believe in dictatorship of the Right or of the Left, or in seizure by force by the Right or by the Left, whether a person calls himself a king or a leader or anything else. We believe in democracy. I hold that the trouble here has been that, while we had everything fixed up, with a Government ranging right through the whole block of political parties, which was in due course going to have a general election to decide where the majority lay, there was a forcible attempt by a minority to seize power. Some people who call themselves Left are not believers in democratic methods. It has been suggested, although it is not suggested so often now—although again, I think, my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe rather suggested it—that we were specially interested in putting back the King of Greece. We really are not. With the situation in Europe we had to deal with a great many Governments who, unfortunately, had been driven out of their own countries. Some were monarchists, some were republicans; in some cases there was not a Government, but only representatives. In any case, would it have been right for us, without the will of the people, to change the Government from a monarchy to a republic, or from a republic to a  monarchy? We had to deal with things as they were.
1945-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1945-1-18;War Situation And Foreign Policy;151;It is not a question of a Fascist, but of a Right-Wing, Government. Do not fall into the error of the hon. Member for West Fife, of thinking that everybody who is Right-Wing is Fascist. They may be old-fashioned monarchists, Catholics, and the like. Do not let Hitler get away with it by giving him too many companions. Therefore, I say that we were right to see that the Greeks got a fair chance with their own Government. I would ask hon. Members to get away from that typical British habit of dealing with the Balkans by falling in love with one party or one nationality. It is very difficult to get knowledge of all the facts. I would say that, on the record of this Government and on the known opinions of this Government, we have the right to be trusted to carry out the principles in which we believe.

A wider area of sea is notified as dangerous to shipping for a limited period, but not closed. It has never been considered a violation of the freedom of the seas to use areas outside territorial waters temporarily for gunnery and bombing practice, but when shipping is about to enter a danger area it has been warned off, and, if necessary, escorted to safe waters. For the British test in Australia a danger area of about 25,000 square miles was prescribed. The United States action does not run contrary, therefore, to our own policy, or with the principle on which we notify areas as dangerous to shipping. No action by Her Majesty's Government is, therefore, contemplated.

I personally think it would be a very grievous thing if impediments grew up in the way of meetings of what have been called the Big Three—the three major Powers—because, although we all want much larger organ isms to come into being, without the agreement and accord of the three major Powers there may well be an obstacle to all future development. I, therefore, wish to compliment the Foreign Secretary on his resolve to go, and to wish him the greatest possible success in his mission. These personal contacts are of very great value and I trust that they will, in this case, result in the settlement of a great many difficult points and also in the re building of the sympathy and good will between the three major Powers without which we should never have got to this satisfactory conclusion.
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;168;I desire to raise this evening the question of the position of the Foreign Secretary not being a Member of this House. Let me say at the outset that I am not questioning in any way the qualifications of Lord Halifax for the position of Foreign Minister. We all know his great services, his high character and his great abilities. The Prime Minister no doubt selected the man who, he thought, was best fitted for this position, and it is not for us to question that; indeed, I am bound to say that I fully recognise the great difficulty in which the Prime Minister found himself. It would be very difficult for him to find somebody who was qualified by experience and ability to hold the position and was at the same time a supporter of his policy. Between those who had held the office already and had not been a conspicuous success, and those who were thought not likely to be successful, the choice was somewhat narrow.

1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;120;I am not dealing with that specific point; I am controverting the idea that there is some particular virtue in having someone who is not brought into contact with this House. I think it was a dereliction of duty on the part of the House of Commons that it only had three Debates on foreign affairs in all those years before 1914, and I agree with the Colonial Secretary in thinking it unfortunate that the idea, which some Members still hold, had grown up that the Foreign Secretary could be left to carry on without being brought into contact with public opinion. Dealing with the start of the War, the present Foreign Secretary, in May, 1919, went on to say: 
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;74;There is clearly no serious constitutional issue raised to-night. I find myself in very general agreement with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Liberal party on this particular point, and much that he said in his speech, I think, commended itself to the House. There is only one word of advice which I would venture to offer him, with great respect to a party leader, and that is the old Scotch proverb: 
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;47;I am not eligible. It seems to me that everyone who looks at this matter fairly and gives reasonable consideration to the difficulties of the Prime Minister must feel that there was no solution to be found in any of the candidatures to which I have referred.
1938-2-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-2-28;Secretary Of State For Foreign Affairs;285;After the tense atmosphere and the strenuous battles of a week ago, it has been for me quite a change to-night to be able to sit back and to watch those who criticised me then in all parts of the House answering one another's criticisms. I do not know which I enjoyed more—the amusing analysis of my right hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) or the protest of the right hon. Gentleman opposite for the lapse from virtue of his right hon. Friend on the bench below the Gangway. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition addressed to me one question. He challenged my action as a breach of established Parliamentary practice. I did not understand that he was maintaining that position in his speech this evening, and indeed I think it would be very hard for him to maintain it. For although Parliamentary practice does from time to time tend to become established, it would puzzle anyone to say how you are to find the exact moment when establishment takes place. Unless the right hon. Gentleman opposite is to be the arbiter in the matter and to lay down when establishment has been reached, I do not know  how we are to make up our minds on the subject. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for the Gorton Division (Mr. Benn) said that I had flouted and neglected the precedent of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, that great House of Commons man, who, when he had to appoint a Foreign Secretary, appointed a Member of this House because he himself was a Member of this House, thereby establishing a precedent which the right hon. Gentleman says we ought never to depart from.

1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;142;The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I know about this, and in its precursory period, it was always before us when we were colleagues together in the National Government in the later stages of the war. All that we have seen since, are the various manifestations of the forces and factors that are at work. They are alarming and sensational symptoms but the causes have not changed. The root causes have not changed, as we knew them two, three and four years ago, and the Government are well aware of this. There is, therefore, no reason for saying that the new change now proposed by the Minister of Defence from 12 to 18 months' service is required by the darkening of the foreign situation, and I am glad that he did not stress it unduly. The basic facts have not altered.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;143;I wish I could have an opportunity of affording the proof. That, however, is a date upon which it rests  with the Prime Minister to advise the Crown. In 1945, however, as I say, the relations were good, and in my opinion the Government made a mistake—a view which I expressed at the time because I do not try to be wise after the event—in not taking advantage of the situation. I think they made a mistake in believing it necessary to adhere pedantically and rigidly to the scheme of demobilisation to which we have all agreed. But the Government did not take my advice, and the result was that throughout 1946 and a large part of 1947, many hundreds of thousands of men were kept uselessly with the Colours, instead of being able to return to industry where labour was urgently needed.

I did not ask for my right hon. Friend's resignation. My right hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street (Mr. Lawson) desired to retire.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;89;I thank the Prime Minister. Naturally, we cannot always tell what lies behind a Ministerial resignation, but I am quite sure that if my right hon. Friend the Member for Chester-le-Street felt himself in any way unequal to his task, he would be the first man to come forward and lay down a highly important and remunerative public post. As I say, after him came the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bassetlaw. This was somewhat unexpected to those who had read his regular column in the "Daily Mirror"——
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;153;I am ready to withdraw the words "Daily Mirror" and to substitute the words "Sunday Pictorial." I should not like to have a dispute on any such matter. The right hon. Gentleman served with the Expeditionary Force which was safely evacuated at Dunkirk. As I have already said, this again was a somewhat unexpected appointment. I none the less gave as much support as I could to the right hon. Gentleman, and I am sure he tried his best. However, in this case am I right in saying that the Prime Minister took a more severe view? Fifty per cent. of bullseyes is not a bad average. The Prime Minister took a more severe view and dismissed the right hon. Gentleman in arbitrary fashion, so I hear, in October, 1947. It must not be an unmitigated reflection upon the right hon. Gentleman, because the time for this change was influenced by other considerations.
1948-12-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-12-01;National Service (Amendment) Bill;154;Phrases which he used have run all over the country. The "tinker's cuss" was a household word, and he has made that homely and necessary instrument of an honoured profession common to the daily usage of all classes in the land. He had, however, undoubtedly gained political popularity with the Left Wing of the Socialist Party, those gentlemen below the Gangway who attend in ever smaller numbers and with ever less enthusiasm every week. A place had to be found for the right hon. Gentleman at short notice. This struck the knell of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bassetlaw. He was the man for whom the bell tolled. The appointment of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Seaham to be Secretary of State for War compares very well with the appointment of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) to represent us at the United Europe meetings.

After all, men cannot be trained without weapons. The proposal to increase the period of service to 18 months is a serious one, and should be considered in all its bearing on the Second Reading. The idea that by preventing chunks of the subject being discussed the House will be able to arrive at a just conclusion  is a profound illusion which only masters and captivates inferior minds.

We are told that great quantities of arms and ammunition of all kinds were given away or sold to foreign States. I am not speaking of anything done under the Brussels Agreement, but preceding that. Three or three and a half years have not sufficed to enable the Government to make a plan or scheme for the Army, but they have been ample to enable them to dissipate immense quantities of munitions of war which they inherited from their predecessors—a great inheritance which in this, as in other fields, they have certainly not increased.

I ask him: Can the Government now produce, with four times the comparable money voted in 1914, an efficient and well-equipped Force of six or seven divisions, be they infantry, tanks or parachutists, a Force available either for an emergency on the Continent or for home defence? Can the Government produce with four times the money, the Force which was produced by the Liberal Government in 1914? Can they produce a half of it? Can they produce a third of it? Can they produce a quarter of it? I will not go any further today, but I say that with four times the money and unlimited control of man-power, the Government are unable to produce even a quarter of what was available for emergencies in 1914. Here I am speaking  only of the Regular or Field Forces. In Mr. Asquith's and Lord Haldane's day—now nearly 35 years ago—before the first World War, we had, besides the Expeditionary Force I have mentioned, 14 Territorial infantry divisions, which in a year became good troops. According to the Government's present plan the Territorial Army is not even to be fully constituted until 1954—six years hence.

Member is referring to the recent removal of a number of Greek seamen from one of H.M. destroyers in a United Kingdom port. This ship had seen active service in the Royal Navy, but after being refitted was to have been transferred to the Royal Hellenic Navy. In view, however, of recent disturbances in the Mediterranean, and of unrest among the officers and men detailed to take over the ship, the Admiralty were unable to allow her to be commissioned with a Greek crew. The Greek parties on board were accordingly withdrawn and it is quite incorrect to speak of a Greek ship having been disarmed in a British Port.

1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);115;I think the hon. and gallant Gentleman might, at any rate, lay off his sneering snarls when naval officers of great distinction have their names mentioned in the House. Admiral Andrew Cunningham used the expression that it would be "a fifth wheel on the coach." Admiral Tovey, who commanded the Home Fleet for a long time, and had a very important action at sea, and Lord Cork and Orrery have spoken in the same sense. I have here a letter, which I am authorised to read, from Sir Percy Noble, who has not hitherto expressed himself in public, but who has unequalled credentials, because he managed the business himself with success last time. It says: 
1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);171;I was coming to all that, but I was talking of the coastal waters. I ask what that means because the Eastern Atlantic like the Western is under Supreme American command. It is the coastal waters alone that are reserved for Great Britain and I am asking if they end at the 100-fathom line. [HON. MEMBERS: "The Minister does not know."] In any case the area is severely restricted round our own coast, and the line that is drawn, be it the 100-fathom line or not, like the line that will be drawn across the Atlantic in no way corresponds to any boundary which applies to U-boat attack. The English Channel is reserved to us. It is surely not more vital to the integrity of the reception of convoys than the Bay of Biscay or the waters between Iceland and Ireland, or the North Sea, or the Arctic approaches to and from North Russia. It is all one story, and one story that can only be intelligently told from one place.
1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);118;It is rather difficult to work out these rule-of-three sums. [Laughter.] Hon. Members opposite laugh at that; that is all they are fit for. Why should they laugh because I am not prepared to argue that question of whether it is a proportionately larger reserve? It is a grave and foolish thing to cast away valuable ships at the end of a war. It is much better to keep them, even if you do not want them, in care and maintenance, and then you can never tell when they will turn out to be  useful. I have not worked it out in proportion, but at any rate the Americans have a far larger material reserve than we have.
1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);121;The Parliamentary Secretary is a subordinate Minister of the Government and he should not interrupt  from the Front Bench. We have not let our Mercantile Marine diminish. On the contrary, here are the figures. [Interruption.] I think I have the right to put forward the case for the potential contribution which Britain can make to war and transport on the seas. The United States have 12,400,000 tons of merchant shipping in use and 14 million tons in reserve. They have 250,000 tons under construction. Great Britain has 16,600,000 tons in use, or 19,600,000 tons if the Commonwealth and Empire are added, and two million tons under construction, some of it for foreign account. Moreover, we have far larger reserves of merchant—

1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);81;Well, I understood that the Minister of Defence was going to take responsibility for the case today; and everything is relative in importance, and consequently, compared with the Minister of Defence, the hon. Gentleman must accept the position of being subordinate; although let me make it quite clear that this is the first time that I have ever heard the word "subordinate" regarded as un-Parliamentary or even as almost an obscene expression. However, the "damned old fool" has accepted the apology.

I may say that they are all countries for whom I have the strongest regard and from whom I have received many compliments and honours. But let me take four of them—Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Holland. Though we accept the statement that the American Navy is double as strong as the British, the British Navy, even in its present phase, is more than 12 times as strong as all these four put together. Even if France be included, their combined strength is less than a quarter of ours.
1951-4-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-4-19;North Atlantic (Supreme Commander);54;I will say what I have said and what I am going to say.

That sometimes happens in horse racing. I am certainly not seeking to gain personal popularity by what I am going to say. On the contrary, I am saying only what I think is right and true, and should be considered and weighed by the Committee and the Government. I say that there are almost as many powerful arguments in favour of the United States having the command in the Mediterranean as there are against them haying the over-riding command in the Atlantic.

I hope those who listened to the debate will carefully reflect on all that has been said on both sides, and I am certainly not going to endeavour to renew the arguments which I have already submitted to the Committee.

Reports were received yesterday indicating that forces from North Korea had crossed the 38th Parallel at a number of points, in the course of the invasion of the Korean Republic. At the request of the Government of the United States of America an emergency meeting of the Security Council was held, at which a resolution was passed to the effect that the action of the forces of North Korea constituted a breach of the peace. The resolution called for the immediate cessation of hostilities, and called upon the authorities of North Korea to withdraw forthwith their armed forces to the 38th Parallel. The resolution further called upon all  members to render every assistance to the United Nations in the execution of this resolution and to refrain from giving assistance to the North Korean authorities. The delegate of the Soviet Union did not attend.

He was saying that in his own mind he would take a different course from that. It is the fact that we have not challenged the bona fides of the Chairman. What does bona fides mean? I know it is Latin but there are enough public school men opposite who ought to be able to translate it. In my belief, it means good faith, common honesty, decent Parliamentary behaviour. Nobody has attempted to challenge that in any way. What we have challenged is his judgment in this matter and the manner in which he interpreted the rules of the House.

I was astonished that the right hon. Gentleman should devote so much time to relieving our minds of a suspicion which has certainly never entered them.

In these matters we are primarily concerned with the opinion of the House, and we cannot always provide against ideas which may arise or may be floating about through the public who take an interest in political affairs. At any rate, we did not suggest at any time that there was collusion, and I am very glad to reach a point on which we can have general agreement between the two sides of the House.

1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;147;On a point of Order. While I think that everyone must agree that we should not prejudice the work of the Committee we are setting up, I would like to ask you, Mr. Speaker, to make clear exactly how far this Ruling goes. I have a recollection of other Committees in which there has been a proposal to set up a Select Committee, in which the House did, as a matter of fact, discuss the whole substance of the matter. I would refer to the Marconi inquiry, and particularly to the Amendment, which, I think, was moved by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Spen Valley (Sir J. Simon) on what is known as the Campbell case. When he moved that Amendment the Debate did not alter its character, but continued to be a discussion of the incidents and the rights and wrongs of the case.
1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;197;I rise to support the Motion moved by the Prime Minister, and I am very glad that the Government have accepted the proposal, that first came from the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Sandys), of a Select Committee to deal with this matter, because the matter involves very important issues. It is, I think, fundamentally a House of Com  mons matter, and we are fortunate that on this occasion we have not had that party division which sometimes makes discussion on the setting up of a Select Committee somewhat acrimonious. Here we have an issue arising which concerns the rights of the whole of the Members of this House. The issues are very far-reaching and are of the utmost importance to this House, this country and to democracies throughout the whole world. They involve the liberties and the rights of the Members of this House acting in the performance of their duty to their constituencies. They involve the practice of our Parliamentary institutions, and they raise questions as to the relationship between the Executive and the Members of this House, and also the question of the relationship of the Executive to the Law Officers of the Crown.

It is quite certain that in this House we could not go into the personal issues involved. Each one of these cases which have been presented to us represents only the most abridged form in which the Member or Minister concerned would state his points, and in order to form any judgment upon the merits, it would be necessary to have a far longer statement and to have it thrashed out by examination and cross-examination. Therefore, I can assure you, Sir, that you will not find that I shall endeavour to open in any detailed way the personal question involved; though I consider that the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Liberal Opposition, in certain remarks which he made upon the minor aspects of this case, the question of the usage of  Members by Ministers, was fully justified in saying what he did. I propose to confine myself to a comparatively small number of general observations which I believe it is appropriate to make on such occasions, as they are intended to have a suggestive effect to the Committee which very soon will begin its labours, and also because there are certain points at the present time which are of real importance and on which it is really important that opinion should be expressed in this House.
1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;115;I am not concerned as to whether what I say is liked in any quarter of the House. I am concerned in stating a case which I believe it is my duty to state. I do trust that the Committee—I do not intend to go at all into the personal issues—will examine the action of the Attorney-General, whose well meaning, upright character endears him to all of us, but nevertheless it does seem to me that a mixing-up of functions is very much to be deprecated and that informal discussions upon matters which may take a criminal turn are not consonant either with the standard of British justice or with the propriety of Parliamentary life.
1938-6-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-6-30;Official Secrets Acts;187;I am endeavouring to deal with the question in a general way, and I say that we have had statements or speeches about the anti-aircraft artillery which are misleading, which I have characterised in this House as misleading, and which are in some ways more to be criticised because very often they are verbally and literally true. The point that I am approaching is this: It may be that  such statements do comfort the country, even if they deceive it, but the question which I think the Committee should turn its attention to, dwell upon, and weigh carefully is whether this kind of statements deceive possible foreign adversaries. I should have thought there was no branch of our defence upon which it was more easy for information to be obtained than about the state of our anti-aircraft artillery. There are thousands of men in the units. They know perfectly well what the main facts are, what are the weapons they have and what are the weapons they have not. They are, I have no doubt, indignant at the misleading statements which they consider are made about them.

We are all also very glad that the Government in this matter have not been bound by a narrow view of the precedents for such a tribute. There have been exceptions, and they have been made in accordance with the general feeling of the House, which, in such matters, is probably the safest of guides. The Prime Minister has mentioned two outstanding cases where the exact forms were not observed, but where the feelings of the House desired an opportunity of corporate expression. Oliver Stanley may well be another of these exceptions.

What is the point of bringing the King's Recommendation into this matter when it clearly is a House of Commons insistence upon the financial provisions being observed? Of course, the King's Assent has been required and is invariably required to the proposing of a money charge, but that was simply to prevent everybody getting up in all parts of the House and bidding for popularity by proposing to give away large sums from the Exchequer to their constituents or other people in whom they had an interest. There is no relation at all.

Gentleman, the Leader of the House, has handled the matter in a very conciliatory and painstaking manner and one must recognise the fact that it would be inconvenient for the House if the Bill had to be reprinted and certainly could not be taken tomorrow. It would be a complete derangement of our business, and, therefore, one regrets that the procedure was adopted in the first instance, but it was adopted on the false assumption that the Bill would have an uncontested passage because it was comparatively unimportant. We are confronted with the dilemma of spoiling the arrangements for Business which have been set out. We have made very effectively our protest on the broad principle of not ignoring the financial provisions which are an essential part of our procedure, and having done that, and having received from the Leader of the House what I take to be a clear assurance that this is not to be a precedent for general application to our legislation, I think we should not find it necessary to divide the House against the Motion.

1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;240;Yes. The right hon. Gentleman said that I denied that there was frontier rectification. I never denied any such thing, and I challenge him to find any place where I did. There is nothing sinister about it. A considerable part of the boundary has never been demarcated. It is obvious it must be necessary for a complete understanding between us, and if we are, as we desire, to remove possible sources of difference, it is absolutely necessary that we should determine where the boundary lies, and that we should also agree upon any rights which people living on either side of the border may have on the other side of the border for the purposes of watering cattle, and so on. Finally, on page 34, we have the Notes exchanged between the Egyptian Minister in Rome, the Italian Foreign Minister and Lord Perth, under which Egypt is associated with the  Declaration about Lake Tsana in Annex 5, and, as the Territorial Power concerned, with the Declaration about the Suez Canal which is found in Annex 8. I think that completes this brief analysis of the terms of the Agreement, and it will be observed that, whereas the Notes exchanged and the Bon Voisinage Agreement have already come into operation, the Protocol itself, with its Annexes, is not to come into force until such date as the Governments are hereafter to determine. I think the reason for that is very clear.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;99;With regard to Spain, there have been suspicions, which have been frequently expressed, that Italy not only when the time came would refuse to withdraw volunteers in accordance with the Non-Intervention Committee's Agreement, but that she also was aiming at acquiring for herself some permanent position, either in Spain itself or in some of Spain's overseas possessions. Therefore, I desire to call particular attention to Count Ciano's letter, which is to be found on page 28 of the White Paper, in which he gave three specific assurances to the British Government. First of all, he said the Italian Government: 
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;4;Is there general appeasement?
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;9;The Mediterranean Agreement is a step towards general appeasement.

On the coming into force it will certainly be de jureWhat I was saying was that the justification for recognition de jurewould be that it was an essential factor in getting back to general appeasement. I do not think we  could feel that we had got back or that we were taking steps towards general appeasement unless at the same time we could see that a Spanish settlement was within reach. That is a reason why we have made this Spanish settlement a prerequisite of the entry into force of this instrument, and a pre-requisite therefore of the recognition of the Italian conquest.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;10;What does the right hon. Gentleman mean by a settlement?

At this stage it would be wrong to try to define the circumstances in which one could say that a settlement had been arrived at.

1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;53;The right hon. Gentleman is asking the House to approve a Treaty that is to come into force on the specific terms that there should be a settlement in Spain, and now he says that he cannot tell the House what a settlement is. It is ridiculous. The House is entitled to know.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;95;There I leave myself to the judgment of the House. I cannot tell the House even when this Protocol and Annexes will come into force. No doubt the situation will clear itself up as time goes on. The right hon. Gentleman does not agree with that policy I know, but I do not think the House in general will feel that this is not a policy or that I am being unduly obscure at the moment in declining to say what is to be the final definition of the words "settlement of the Spanish situation."

1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;99;We have placed on the Paper an Amendment to the Prime Minister's Motion in which we set out our reasons for disagreeing with these proposals. The Prime Minister in his speech  —I am sorry he is not present—made his usual sneer at the Opposition. That is becoming habitual with him now. He said that it was not worth while taking any notice of the terms in which this Amendment was put down. He followed it up by indulging in ostentatious conversation all the time that my right hon. Friend the Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison) was talking.
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;101;We are getting rather accustomed to that kind of thing now. If the Prime Minister had been here I was going to point out to him that that kind of treatment of the Opposition is not a sign of strength. It is a sign of weakness. Mere bad manners does not mean strength. There was a very obvious reason why the Prime Minister did not deal with this Amendment. It was because he could not controvert its terms. It opens by stating clearly something which is the subject of constant misrepresentation by Ministers of the Crown and Government supporters. It states: 
1938-5-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-5-02;Anglo-Italian Agreement;143;The Prime Minister chooses in this connection to use the names of Mazzini and Garibaldi. I think he might spare their memory. If he knows anything about Mazzini and Garibaldi he will know that they would not have approved of the Fascist regime. Does he suppose that Mazzini and Garibaldi would have joined in helping to destroy a friendly republic in Spain? If the Prime Minister knows anything of them he will remember that Garibaldi, in his old age in 1871, turned out again to fight for the French Republic, his fellow-republicans, against Germany, despite all the wrongs done to him by France when they took his birthplace from Italy. If he were alive to-day, Garibaldi would be with the Garibaldi legionaries, the men who made the Black-shirts run at Guadalajara. Garibaldi was well summed up by Mr. George Trevelyan in these words:

Whatever differences we may have, there is no doubt that this House of Commons has shown itself most vigilant in matters affecting the honour of Members or Ministers in questions of breach of confidence or questions of breach of privilege, or in questions of the character which are now brought to our notice. No Parliament has shown itself more vigorous and forward in this matter, and we have no complaint whatever to make of the course which the Prime Minister has proposed.

1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);197;I must say I regret the terms of the Government's Motion, and, although not altogether for the same reasons, I find myself endorsing the pleas which have been advanced from both the Opposition parties in the House. But I still hope that the Prime Minister has not said his last word on this subject. It is in that hope that I venture to offer a few reasons for my opposition to the Motion. This House is sometimes disparaged in this country, but abroad it counts. Abroad, the House of Commons is counted, and especially in dictator countries, as a most formidable expression of the British national will and an instrument of that will in resistance to aggression. "Surely that is a fact which must be admitted. The dictators themselves have not been slow to notice that minority opinion in this House has seemed in one way to influence the course of Government action. It is in accordance with minority opinion in this House that  we have come together upon a foreign policy upon which all are agreed, a foreign policy which the two dictator States deeply deprecate. Therefore, I say that we count deeply in their thoughts.

1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);231;We have now debated this question for over three hours, and I think the House is probably prepared to come to a decision. I have not noticed any signs of conversion visibly proceeding on the part of hon. Members who have listened to the proceedings on one side or the other. Before I examine the arguments that have been put forward there is one matter to which, I think, I must address myself for a minute or two. Two speeches were made by hon. Members opposite, the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Tinker) and the hon. Member for Ince (Mr. G. Macdonald) which were particularly addressed to myself, and which greatly impressed me by their evident sincerity. They particularly asked me to believe that in the minds of the back benchers this was not regarded as a Vote of Censure. They wanted me, therefore, to give more unbiased and impartial consideration to what they put before me than I could have afforded if my own position were at stake. I am afraid the speech of the hon. Member for Maryhill (Mr. Davidson) will have shown the two hon. Members that they cannot speak for the back benches either, and however much they might wish to disassociate themselves from the Front Bench, it is to the Front Bench that I must look for an official exposition of the views of the Opposition.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);279;No. That was not what he said. He said they would take the opportunity when the back of Parliament was turned to do something they would not be able to do when Parliament was sitting. I am not complaining about the right hon. Gentleman speaking frankly on this subject. On the contrary, I am rather grateful to him for having put the matter so clearly. All that I want to point out to my hon. Friends is that, when the matter has been put in that way, it is the good faith of the Government that is at stake, and whether there be a three-line whip, a two-line whip, or no whip at all, a vote against the Government on this occasion must, after the position taken up by the right hon. Gentleman, be a vote of want of confidence. It must be clear in every quarter of the House that the good faith of the Government is questioned. My right hon. Friend the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill) was good enough to say that he did not distrust my good faith; it was my judgment that he distrusted. I am rather inclined to say, tu quoque. Still we come back to the same point. It does not matter whether you mistrust the Government because you mistrust their good faith or because you mistrust their judgment; the question is whether you trust the Government or distrust the Government. If you distrust them, and show it by your vote, very well; it is a vote of no confidence in the Government, and no confidence in the Prime Minister in particular. That is all I want to say on that point.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);238;It would be three weeks nearer the time, I agree. There were some warning words in the official communiqueé from Moscow which perhaps the hon. Gentleman may not have read, and, in view of that, it is quite clear that in their opinion it would not be wise  to be too optimistic about reaching a very speedy conclusion. Then there was the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Amery), that perhaps the matter would be cleared up if the two illustrations which I had given as to the circumstances which might lead me to recommend Mr. Speaker to call the House together were to be supplemented by saying that there were other conceivable circumstances in which the House might be called together. He went on to make what I thought was a more questionable suggestion, namely, that I should give an assurance that I would listen favourably to any request from the Opposition that the House should be called together. That would not at all suit the Leader of the Opposition, because he said that the responsibility lay here, and that this was the only place where it ought to lie. With that I thoroughly agree. But if I were to say that I would call the House together on the demand of the Opposition, the responsibility would no longer lie here, but across the Floor of the House with hon. Gentlemen opposite.

Let me say that in the long run that is the consideration which overrides everything else, and that is the consideration which, to the best of the judgment that the Government can exercise, must control the time at which the House would be called together.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);92;Or earlier than that. The suggestion was that Parliament could have so altered affairs in Europe that the independence of Czechoslovakia could ultimately have been preserved. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Caithness (Sir A. Sinclair) went further still. He said that if Parliament had been summoned we could have mobilised the Fleet and made an agreement with Russia, which would have saved Czecho-Slovakia. I am not going to make any comment on that suggestion by the right hon. Gentleman; I am just going to leave it in its full beauty.
1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);42;The right hon.

1939-8-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1939-8-02;Adjournment (Summer);252;It is perfectly clear, if one takes the Amendment of the Opposition as it stands, that it is completely without reasonable foundation. No one could possibly say that there is any reason to pick out a particular date in August and say that that would be a suitable date for the meeting of Parliament. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping said that it would be a splendid thing to have this date up our sleeve. That seems to me a singularly unfortunate description of a procedure which would tie us down to this date. I claim that the procedure which we are proposing and which has been followed on other occasions, is the procedure which would enable us to have a Debate up our sleeve, and keep it up our sleeve until there is reason to bring it down again. I put it to the House that the Amendment of the right hon. Gentleman opposite is inconsistent with its avowed purpose, that it has no logical foundation, and that, on account of the reasons which he has given to the House for adopting it, namely, that it is moved because of the distrust of the party opposite with the Government in general, and with the Prime Minister in particular—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]—which is endorsed, at any rate, by some of the backbenchers opposite—the Amendment is reduced merely to another form of the usual vote of no confidence in the Government, and I confidently expect my hon. Friends to defeat it.

Naturally, we should like something more than this very vague statement, as to the results we are to achieve by this new sacrifice, and, as the right hon.

Gentleman was able to read out just now—[HON. MEMBERS: "Withdraw" "Play the game "]— nothing but the rigmarole, which he was pleased to read out just now—I apply that to the particular phrase which he used in giving us a little more information—and if anyone can see any meaning in it, from beginning to end, I shall be most interested. It was given in that officialese which is not meant to give any information at all, but to provide a certain pabulum of words. We shall, naturally, not attempt to form any opinion on the statement which has just been made, at this moment. We should like to have a little time to consider it, and perhaps an announcement can be made on Monday, after discussions have taken place through the usual channels, as to whether a Debate should be arranged on the subject or not.

1950-11-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-29;County Council Staffs, Durham (Trade Union Membership);164;May I ask the Leader of the House a question on a matter of business, which has some urgency? As he is aware, a debate took place on the Motion for the Adjournment on 15th November, when the hon. Member for Luton (Dr. Hill) raised the question of the decision of the Durham County Council to dismiss any employees who were not members of a trade union. In reply, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health indicated that he would draw the attention of the council to a Ministry of Health circular issued by this  Department which was in conflict with this decision. It is now reported that the Durham County Council intend to adhere to their decision. This raises the urgent question of whether the employees of the Durham County Council may not be, at this moment, under pressure to join a union against their will. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman when we can have a statement on this question?
1950-11-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-29;County Council Staffs, Durham (Trade Union Membership);36;Perhaps, however, a little later, we can raise the question whether the matter should not be discussed in the House at some convenient opportunity.

I do not want to rob them of any credit which may belong to them. An Amendment was put down for the abolition of capital punishment. The Cabinet had to decide how this Amendment should be treated, and they decided, as a result of a sort of bargain, that it should be left to a free vote of the House. This, no doubt, appeared a convenient method of disposing of the differences of opinion which prevailed among Members of the Cabinet and in the Socialist Party.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);107;The Government were considering their own party in this matter. But it was not a proper way of dealing with a matter of this gravity, on which the Cabinet on any given occasion should have a united and collective view. We know from the Home Secretary's speech in the house that this, above all others, was in his opinion not the time to make such a change in the law, and he stated his reasons to the House in, the strongest terms. He even said that there might have been an increase in the number of murders but for the enforcement of the death penalty, and added: 
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);40;—suspending capital punishment was added to the Bill and the long-established custom of our country was suspended against the advice of the Government and especially of the Minister publicly and personally responsible.

1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);209;But experimental in relation to an entirely different set of facts. We all remember how Queen Elizabeth dealt with poetry and blank verse"—"Marry, this is something. This is rhyme! But this"—the blank verse"—"is neither rhyme nor reason." That is what we have before us now—a mere jumble of points which seem popular at the moment to deal with cases in which, to quote the Attorney-General, public opinion feels that the suspension of the death penalty involves risk—public opinion having been measured in less than a few weeks. It is a mere jumble of points which seem popular at the moment, and which have been suggested by the more recent batch of murders as recorded in the newspapers. It has been put together not with the object of making a better and more humane system of criminal justice but of getting round an awkward Cabinet or Parliamentary difficulty. The Attorney-General said it was a compromise. Confusion is not compromise. A bargain between politicians  in difficulties ought not to be the basis of our criminal law. This is an attempt, as the Attorney-General said, to steer a middle course, to steer a course of "no meaning" between the "No" of the abolitionists and the "Yes" of the mass of ordinary folk.

It is in the weeks and days and hours before hanging that the ordeal to which criminals are subjected arises. In this case the men I am speaking of were made to go through this ordeal again and again, without being considered to have expiated their crime.

We all know that Law Officers in his position have to be trotted out to cover up the most difficult and unsatisfactory situations into which Governments get. I have often seen it done, but never have I seen it done with such an undue parading of his own particular opinion on a matter upon which a great profession could form its own judgment.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);72;I take full responsibility for everything I say. The jury will have  to be instructed and will have to decide whether a killing was in the course of or in connection with the offences described in Subsection (1, a) of the Clause or whether it was for any of the specified purposes in Subsection (1, b), or whether it was in the case of poisoning by systematic administration under Subsection (1, c).
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);50;Well, the Government will have an opportunity of speaking. The Home Secretary can say what it is. I am told by people who have studied this and have great professional attainments that what I have just said is correct because the jury will in many cases have to be advised—
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);159;The right hon. and learned Gentleman may shake his head till he shakes it off, but it does not affect the argument. Intense difficulty will occur in the case of a murder alleged to have happened during a rape. I am advised that the judge would have to direct the jury first as to constructive malice under the law as it is at present—that is to say, the malice that is implied from death resulting from a felony involving violence—and secondly, express malice under the law introduced by the Amendment—that is to say, an intention to kill or maim by an act which might reasonably be expected to endanger life. If that is not correct, when the Home Secretary or any other person of authority winds up, no doubt we shall be told, but it is not much good the Government proclaiming facts which are not correct in regard to the existing interpretation of the law of the land.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);2;The offence—
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);113;I really would not say anything more controversial than that the Home Secretary would have the power to answer these points and let us know  the view of the Government on them. If I am told that the defence of the ravisher in this case could be that he did not intend to use more force than was necessary to make the unfortunate woman submit to his approaches, is he then to escape the supreme penalty because there is no proved intention to kill or maim? All those points, I am assured, will have to be put to ordinary jurymen and jury-women who have never before been called upon to split such hairs.
1948-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-7-15;Clause 1—(Suspension Of Death Penalty For Murder);138;Ordinary jurymen and jurywomen who have never been called upon to split such hairs will now have to do it for the first time with a human life at stake. This Clause will in consequence give rise to endless legal arguments both before the judge and in the Court of Criminal Appeal. The result will be to make it more likely that certain categories of murderers will be hanged while other categories, equally heinous, cannot be. Secondly, it must tend in the long run to hamper the Home Secretary or some other Home Secretary in the exercise of his unlimited discretion which is by far, the most elastic, sympathetic and comprehending process that can possibly be used. But it is the ordeal to which juries will be subjected on which the main weight of the practical case rests.

I have made my speech, and a very long one. I have certainly not any intention of taking up the time of the House in dealing with this  hypothetical question.

A large proportion, three Labour Members, will be there, and I must say that I think it is a churlish manner to receive an announcement of this kind, in which all my colleagues are in full agreement. I do not mean with all I have said just now, but the statement on the Delegation in which all my colleagues are agreed.

1951-5-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-29;Road Haulage Strike;44;No doubt he could if the right hon. Gentleman had given notice that he would put the question. It is quite unusual for anyone in this House to get up at any time and ask questions of any Minister without giving any notice whatever.
1951-5-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-5-29;Road Haulage Strike;48;It surely would not have been unprecedented at all for a Minister to supplement the information given by the Minister giving the answer with that special part of the essential information which was known only to that other Minister.

1941-6-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-6-25;By-Election Publication, Greenock;97;The Question refers to an account, published in a Communist circular, of a speech by the hon. Member for Shettleston (Mr. McGovern), relating to conversations with Lord Beaverbrook. Lord Beaverbrook received in February, 1940, from the hon. Member for Shettleston for exclusive publication in his newspapers an account of the so-called Tavistock Peace Plan. A conversation followed on 5th March, 1940'. The hon. Member for Shettleston invited Lord Beaverbrook to support the Plan. A written statement seeking support and signed by Lord Tavistock was submitted on 6th March. Lord Beaverbrook replied on 8th March, 1940, as follows: 
1941-6-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-25;By-Election Publication, Greenock;43;As to legal action, I can say nothing, but it is very common in by-elections for a lot of untruthful and tendentious statements to be put into circulation, and I should myself doubt whether any importance should be attached to such malicious vapourings.

1941-6-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-25;By-Election Publication, Greenock;52;I am assured that they are untrue. The hon. Gentleman, I understand, was present at a private conversation and more than a year afterwards gave his own version of the conversation which passed. In those circumstances I should think the utmost distrust should be placed upon any statement of the hon. Gentleman's.
1941-6-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-25;By-Election Publication, Greenock;54;No Sir, I see no need at all for further inquiries. A newspaper proprietor sees all sorts of people and hears all sorts of views, because that is his business, and I suppose that from time to time he gets ill-used by inventions being put about as to what has passed at private conversations.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);19;On 7th October, 1941, before the winter battle in Libya, I gave a ruling on this subject as follows:—
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);26;I have carefully considered this matter and taken a great deal of different opinions on the subject, and the result, as I believe, has been satisfactory.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);54;The joint training of the Army and the Royal Air Force is already proceeding on a considerable  scale and is being continually extended. The aircraft of Army co-operation command, which is itself being substantially expanded, are occupied solely on such training. Squadrons of Bomber and Fighter Command are also regularly used for this purpose.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);58;Of course, this subject is capable of extensive discussion, but we have to try and find the true and proper course between, on the one hand, not having aircraft attached to the infantry, which would be a misfortune, and, on the other, keeping large masses of aircraft which are required for major purposes standing by on specialised functions.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);35;I would not say it is quite satisfactory, but it is being pressed forward with the utmost energy, in complete accord with both the Services concerned and the technical branches which are at their disposal.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);51;The whole question of air-borne troops, whether it concerns the gliders which may be attached to machines with power, whether it concerns parachute troops themselves, or whether it concerns the aircraft which are power driven and tow the gliders—all these are under one organisation and are being studied as a whole.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);66;If my hon. Friend read my statement at leisure, he will see that I go further than that. The entire  Air Force is subordinated to the purposes of the military commander; he says what he wants them to do, but naturally you must not interfere with the characteristics of a particular arm. How the purposes are carried out is a matter for the Air Officer Commanding.
1942-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-7-07;Army And Air Force (Co-Operation);25;I should be glad to consider it, but I should not like to answer the question without having had the benefit of that process beforehand.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;224;Little more than seven weeks have passed since we rose for the summer vacation, but this short period has completely changed the face of the war in Europe. When we separated, the Anglo-American Armies were still penned in the narrow bridgehead and strip of coast from the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula to the approaches to Caen, which they had wrested from the enemy several weeks before. The Brest Peninsula was untaken, the German Army in the West was still hopeful of preventing us from striking out into the fields of France, the Battle of Normandy, which had been raging bloodily from the date of the landing, had not reached any decisive conclusion. What a transformation now meets our eyes! Not only Paris, but practically the whole of France, has been liberated as if by enchantment. Belgium has been rescued, part of Holland is already free, and the foul enemy, who for four years inflicted his cruelties and oppression upon these countries, has fled, losing perhaps 400,000 in killed and wounded and leaving in our hands nearly half a million prisoners. Besides this, there may well be 200,000 cut off in the coastal fortresses or in Holland whose destruction or capture may now be deemed highly probable. The Allied Armies have reached and in some places crossed the German frontier and the Siegfried Line.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;124;As the population has increased by 50,000,000 in the last 10 years it is evident that the famine, which was caused by military conditions last year affecting transport, is by no means representative of the administration under which the broad peninsula and triangle of India has met an increase in population exceeding the speed of any increase in any other country throughout the whole world. I think it a very remarkable fact that India has received this shelter and has been this vast harbour of peace, protected by the arms and policy of Great Britain, protected also by the care and attention of this House. In this the brave fighting races of India have at all times borne a most honourable and memorable part.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;209;When we were last assembled here I had completed a review of the military situation which, although not by any means complete or exhaustive, yet, I trust, gave the general outline of our position at the present time from the point of view of one who has special opportunities of seeing things in their broad perspective. The foreign situation has responded to military events. Never was the alliance against Germany of the three great Powers more close or more effective. Divergencies of view and interest there must necessarily be, but at no time have these been allowed to affect in any way the majestic march of events in accordance with the decisions and agreements at Teheran. One by one, in rapid succession, the satellite States have writhed or torn themselves free from the  Nazi tyranny, and, as is usual in such cases, the process has not been one from alliance with Germany to neutrality, but from alliance with Germany to war. This has taken place in Roumania and Bulgaria. Already there is fighting between the Finns and the Germans. The Germans, in acordance with their usual practice and character, are leaving a trail of burnt and blackened villages behind them, even in the land of their unhappy Finnish dupes.
1944-9-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-9-28;War And International Situation;45;I did not put it quite that way. I said the world was becoming less ideological, but I did not say that ideological differences did not matter. They matter a great deal, and I hope they are being adjusted in the ranks of the Allies.

1941-2-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-2-11;Export Trade;149;As the published figures indicate, the war has necessarily limited the volume of our exports, but export trade is still of the greatest importance as an essential part of our war effort. The difficulties which confront exporters are many and complex, and it is the function of the Department of Overseas Trade to assist exporters to overcome these difficulties. This entails a heavy burden of work on the Department, and particularly its overseas officers, as is demonstrated by the fact that the number of inquiries reaching the Department is as great as before the war. The Department works in the closest collaboration with the Board of Trade and the Export Council, of which body the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade is the Vice-Chairman. Special care is taken to ensure that there is no overlapping, and no advantage would result from the amalgamation suggested by my hon. Friend.
1943-7-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-01;Inter-Allied Committee's Investigation;197;His Majesty's Government are well aware of the penetration of European industry and finance by Nazi Germany, and in particular by the Hermann Goering Trust. His Majesty's Government jointed with the other Allied Governments chiefly concerned in making a Declaration on 5th January of this year which emphasized their intention to defeat all methods of dispossession practised by the enemy Powers in territories under their occupation or control. As a result of this Declaration, the text of which is contained in Command Paper 6418, an Inter-Allied Committee of Experts was set up in London to prepare the way for further action by a study of the relevant law and by the collection of the necessary information on what the enemy has done and is still doing. The Governments of the United States of America, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, and the Governments of the European Allies are all represented on this Committee, which is assembling much valuable material. This information, together with information from other sources, including, of course, relevant reports published by the United States Office of War Information, will naturally be taken into full account in framing the future plans of the United Nations.
1944-2-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-2-22;War And Internationa Situation;208;This is no time for sorrow or rejoicing. It is a time for preparation, effort and resolve. The war is still going on. I have never taken the view that the end of the war in Europe is at hand, or that Hitler is about to collapse, and I have certainly given no guarantees, or even held out any expectations, that the year 1944 will see the end of the European war. Nor have I given any guarantees the other way. On the whole, my information—and I have a good deal—goes to show that Hitler and his police are still in full control, and that the Nazi party and the Generals have decided to hang together. The strength of the German Army is about 300 divisions, though many of these are substantially reduced in numbers. The fighting quality of the troops is high. The German General Staff system; which we failed to liquidate after the last war, represents an Order comprising many thousands of highly-trained officers and a school of doctrine of long, unbroken continuity. It possesses great skill, both in the handling of troops in action and in their rapid movement from place to place. The recent fighting in Italy should leave no doubt on these points.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);92;The course of events in India has been improving and is, on the whole, reassuring. The broad principles of the declaration made by His Majesty's Government which formed the basis of the Mission of the Lord Privy Seal to India, must be taken as representing the settled policy of the British Crown and Parliament. These principles stand in their full scope and integrity. No one can add anything to them, and no one can take anything away. The good offices of the Lord Privy Seal were rejected by the Indian Congress Party.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);68;This, however, does not end the matter. The Indian Congress Party does not represent all India. It does not represent the majority of the people of India. It does not even represent the Hindu masses. It is a political organisation built around a party machine and sustained by certain manufacturing and financial interests. Outside  that party and fundamentally opposed to it are the 90,000,000 Moslems in British India——
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);128;—who have their rights of self-expression; the 50,000,000 Depressed Classes, or the Untouchables as they are called because they are supposed to defile their Hindu co-religionists by their presence or by their shadow; and the 95,000,000 subjects of the Princes of India with whom we are bound by treaties; in all 235,000,000 in these three large groupings alone, out of about 390,000,000 in all India. This takes no account of large elements among the Hindus, Sikhs and Christians in British India who deplore the present policy of the Congress Party. It is necessary that these main facts should not be overlooked here or abroad, because no comprehension of the Indian problem or of the relations between Britain and India is possible without the recognition of these basic data.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);77;I have thought that the accounts in British newspapers have been very full of what has happened in India. I have endeavoured to give the House a considered statement of the facts, every one of which is established, in order to add to the information which has appeared from time to time. It is very necessary, I agree, that information of the real facts should be made public, not only here, but also in the United States.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);46;When we come to the Adjournment any hon.

1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);57;It is my business to speak in the name of the War Cabinet, and I have every reason to believe that I am doing so. I do not mean by that that I submit every word of a statement and go through it line by line, but the general policy is the policy of His Majesty's Government.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);47;Of course, it is very unusual to seek to inquire what are the details of the discussions which prevail in any Government, but I have every reason to believe that my colleagues approve of the statement I have made, as I think does the House in general.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);51;The hon. Gentleman is a merchant of discourtesy. I was about to answer his question, and I can do so by saying that up to a very late hour last night my right hon.

1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);21;I have made it perfectly clear in my statement that those proposals, which were solemnly undertaken, in their broad principles stand.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);37;I have no information which would lead to that idea, and, of course, in the present state of affairs in India, with invasion not far off, these constitutional solutions and agreements are very difficult to come to.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);154;There was a feeling in a great many quarters that the Debate on the Adjournment might prove the occasion for some reference to Indian affairs, and, no doubt, opinions will be expressed on both sides on this matter as the Chair may call Members. I entirely agree that we must look forward to an opportunity in the future, in the not distant future, for debating the general issue that is open now in India. Personally, I think that when we come back such an opportunity might well be found, though one must see what is the exact situation in that country as to whether it would be a good moment for a very extended Debate. But the Government have a perfectly plain and clear policy upon which they are united, and we are quite ready to stand any Debate or discussion which the House may wish to raise, having regard to the general interest.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);47;The reinforcements have been sent to protect the great masses of the Indian people from Japanese invasion. The fact that they are in the country undoubtedly does add to the general stability which happily prevails in India. What was the other point raised by the hon. Gentleman?
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);10;It is not within my power to improvise Parliamentary procedure.
1942-9-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-10;India (Situation);66;On the contrary, I may have learned something about it from 40 years' experience, but I would not attempt to improvise. As a matter of fact, a vote can take place only on a Resolution, and Resolutions require proper notice and so forth, but it may well be that there will be a vote when we have a full-dress Debate on India at a later period.

The precedents are well known and can be studied. Naturally, any request by the Leader of the Opposition—I had not appreciated the distinction, as I thought that the right hon.

1941-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-3-20;Broadcasting Policy (Artistes And Technicians);117;I will answer these two Questions together. The British Broadcasting Corporation have informed me that they have reconsidered the cases of those artistes  who attended the People's Convention, and have decided that they shall not be debarred from giving performances on the broadcast in the normal way as opportunity arises. It is no part of the policy of His Majesty's Government to accord the special facilities of the microphone to persons whose words and actions are calculated to hamper the nation in its struggle for life. But the connection between this and musical and dramatic performances of all kinds, or the relation of such performances to political acts and opinions, are not apparent or worth while establishing.

In his speech on 15th June he stressed that the Government was one of national unity, expressing the united will of the people, and that this unity at the top was reflected right down, in the Services and all branches of the war effort. The arrangements for securing unity of direction of the Armed Forces through the Office of the Minister of Defence and the Defence Committee are known to the House, and no change in them is contemplated.

I am somewhat concerned at the effects produced abroad and overseas by the two days' Debate on Production. Statements that our industry is only working 75 per cent. of some unspecified standard and that the Ministry of Aircraft Production is in chaos from top to bottom tend to give a general impression in the United States and the Dominions, particularly Australia, that things are being very ill-managed here and that we are not trying our best. It is impossible for the newspapers to report our Debates except in a very abridged form, but sensational statements of this kind telegraphed all over the world do serious harm to our cause wherever they go. Moreover, they do not at all represent the immense and well-directed effort which is yielding remarkable results in almost every field of war production, and they do far from justice to the admirable tenure of the Ministry of Supply by my right hon. Friend the present President of the Board of Trade. I much regret that it was not possible for me, because of the many other things I have to do, to be present in the House except during the closing speeches of that Debate. It is obviously not possible for considered Ministerial answers to be submitted to these charges on the spur of the moment. It is not like ordinary party, peace-time fighting, when any score handed across the Table is good enough for the purposes of the occasion. These are very serious times in which we live. I have, however, read thoroughly the OFFICIAL REPORT of the two days' Debate, and I have given directions that all allegations of any serious substance shall be sent to the various Departments concerned in order that the facts may be ascertained. On the Third Sitting Day after 20th July I propose to set up the same Votes as were under discussion last  week and to have a third day's Debate, in Public Session. I will myself endeavour to make a full and comprehensive statement on the whole question of production so far as the public interest permits. I hope by this means, which is inspired by the greatest possible respect for the House, to remove any mistaken and evil impression which may be doing us harm in any part of the world.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);38;I propose to have a third day's Debate and to initiate the Debate myself, and it will then be open for anyone to take up the quarrel, if they think there is any public advantage in so doing.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);163;I do not mind, but when statements are made affecting the whole of our production, and the character of our production, perhaps an hour or two before the end of the Debate, it is quite impossible for Ministers to do justice to them in their answers. If we were engaged in ordinary party politics it would be quite easy to throw cheap scores across the House, to the gratification of the supporters of a Government who are in a majority; but in time of war time for the preparation of a much more reasoned answer is required. Grave consideration has to be given not only to the actual facts but to what part of those facts can be stated in public, and in what form  they can be stated in public, and I certainly could not undertake to answer all the charges that are made in the course of a Debate without having the opportunity of considering the matter maturely and comprehensively beforehand.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);13;Every endeavour will be made to preserve the general liveliness of our discussions.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);43;:The Ministry of Information places no ban upon full publication all over the world of the public Debates in this House. Anything that is said here goes into these other countries, and that is why great responsibility attaches to what is said here.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);105;I cannot admit that there has been any practice of evasion. I do not see why we should evade. We neither need to evade nor to shrink from dividing if necessary and we are perfectly capable of defending ourselves, but in a time of war when the affairs of the country are very complicated, and when enormous business is divided among a great number of Ministers, it is not possible to give the same answers on every topic that is raised as could be done when the ordinary party fight was in progress. Every prominent politician on both sides is well acquainted with that fact.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);39;:I am always indebted to my hon.

1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);47;I do not think I regard the Propaganda Debate as one which has the same far-reaching consequences upon our reputation for carrying on the war, as to reflections upon our system of production. As far as the Government are concerned, I do not think that is likely.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);44;I do not agree at all. I think the newspapers have given most interesting and vivid and lively accounts, and I think the B.B.C. have  given very excellent accounts of what is going on—more than have ever been attempted in time of war before.
1941-7-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-7-15;Business Of The House (Production Debate);28;I will do my best to serve the House, but I think I should be trespassing on their indulgence, if I carried on this heterogeneous colloquy any longer.
1945-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-11-07;Foreign Policy (President Truman's Declaration);109;:I am not sufficiently familiar with the vernacular to follow the exact purpose and intensity of that joke. I am sure they will not use those powers in any aggressive way. Like Great Britain, they have no need for territorial gain. Personally, I feel it must be in most men's minds here today that it is a matter for rejoicing that these powers of manufacture are in such good hands. The possession of these powers will help the United States and our Allies to build  up the structure of world security. It may be the necessary lever which is required to build up that great structure of world security.
1945-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-11-07;Foreign Policy (President Truman's Declaration);179;:I took great pains to read carefully what the hon. and gallant Gentleman said in his very eloquent and able speech, and I think the references which I have made today, and which also were carefully considered, will be found appropriate and not unjust. I am not making any attack. I only say that it occurred to me to be quite clear from what he said that there has been somewhere a breach of confidence, which he published and brought to the notice of the House in the exercise of his responsibilities as a Member of Parliament. This, of course, was immediately telegraphed to the United States, and at the Press Conference the next day President Truman was questioned about it. A truncated  report appeared in some of the newspapers here, with the answers which he gave, but not setting forth the exact question which elicited the answer. I have taken pains to verify the actual text of the answers which President Truman gave at his Press Conference on 31st October. He was asked by correspondents the following question: 
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);16;I am already devoting particular attention to this question, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);23;I do not think a board is necessary, because there is the closest working between the organisations on both sides of the Atlantic.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);64;My information does not suggest that security officers require further powers; and, in view of the wide variety of establishments to which the hon. Gentleman refers, I doubt whether it would be practicable or desirable to impose a greater uniformity of  practice. I am, however, asking the Ministers responsible to give special attention to the need for vigilance regarding the security of these establishments.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);14;Yes, Sir, I am doing my best to ensure that that shall not happen.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);32;I have myself made inquiries into this from time to time and I shall give continuing attention to the possibility of adapting the methods in use to meet changing needs and circumstances.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);98;My point is a matter of wording. I should like to ask The Prime Minister whether, in answering this Question, he is treating the word "screening" as meaning "sifting" or as meaning "sheltering," because there is a great difference between the two. I looked it up in the dictionary, and I was astonished to find that though "sheltering" is the normal sense of the word, there is, dating from the 17th century, one example of "screening" being used in the sense of "sifting"; but it is important that we should clear up the interpretation of this hard-worked word.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);28;It seems that in the process of recent years we must have returned to the 17th century interpretation of the word. That is how it is used today.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);60;I am well aware that there is some uneasiness, but in these matters, while we have to take the utmost precautions, we also have to preserve the general conditions of the rights of the individual and the liberty of the subject in this country. We cannot employ, and we will not employ, the kind of methods employed in totalitarian countries.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);2;No, Sir.
1950-11-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-11-07;National Defence (Security);74;Because at a certain time there has been what has been called "screening" in the case of a person engaged in high security work, it does not mean that care is not taken thereafter from time to time to follow up any possible danger. I should not like it to be thought that necessarily because someone had been "screened" at a certain time, no steps are taken thereafter. They are, from time to time.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;21;(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether he has any statement to make with regard to the Fleet Air Arm.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;93;Yes, Sir. The proposals which the Government have had under their consideration refer to two classes of aircraft. The first class includes all aircraft borne in ships of the Royal Navy. These are known as the Fleet Air Arm. They are under the operational control of the Admiralty, but as part of the Royal Air Force they are under the administrative control of the Air Ministry. The second class includes shore-based aircraft employed in co-operation with naval forces. These are under the operational as well as the administrative control of the Air Ministry.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;63;Was it not possible for the Prime Minister to arrange to make this statement to the House at a time when we could have discussed it? The whole question of the co-ordination of Defence was debated last Monday, and in view of the length of time which these proceedings have taken, is it only just to-day that a decision has been come to?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;66;I regret as much as the right hon. Gentleman that it was not possible to come to a decision before. Of course, if we had we should have given the House an opportunity of discussing it. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that the decision was not delayed in order to deprive the House of that opportunity. It was reached at the earliest possible moment.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;65;The question of training is one which will have to be worked out by the Admiralty and the Air Ministry in co-operation with one another, and at the present we have not attempted to define the exact lines of agreement. I think it will be found possible to combine control with a certain amount of responsibility on each side without in any way injuring efficiency.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;23;That is another point which, obviously, must be decided by the two Departments after they have had an opportunity of considering the matter.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;36;Are we right in assuming that in principle the Fleet Air Arm will, if necessary, be permitted to have the necessary shore establishments for the purpose of training their own pilots for the Fleet Air Arm?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;14;There must be training of the personnel of the Fleet Air Arm on shore.

1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;75;Again, that is a matter for the Admiralty and the Air Force to consider what is the best plan. I should imagine, for example, that it might be that the Admiralty would have a portion of an aerodrome which is now under the Air Force, and that in another case they might have an aerodrome entirely on their own. I do not think we can say exactly what the decision will be at this moment.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;9;But in principle that is so, is it not?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;2;Yes, Sir.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;9;It would be in order to raise it to-day.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;84;That is what I have said. The broad principle has been determined, but a great many details have to be settled, and I have every reason to suppose that they will be settled amicably by co-operation between the Admiralty and the Air Force. There is no reason why hon. Members should not raise this question on the Motion for the Adjournment, and if they do I have no doubt that my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence will be present.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;68;Is it the view of the Prime Minister that the decision come to by the Government has definitely settled this controversy, and will he use his influence to prevent it being continued as an internecine warfare between the two Departments? If it has not been settled it is no use pretending that it has, and we shall have this constant firing between the Departments over and over again.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;54;The Government decision, as taken, and now made public, is final. As far as it can settle the controversy it has settled it. We cannot prevent individuals from still firing shots but we hope they will refrain from doing so, because it is desirable in the public interest that this controversy should be settled.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;55;I am asking the Prime Minister whether he is going to use his authority to prevent this constant firing between the Departments which has been going on for years now to the detriment of the Services. If a decision had been come to, is he going to insist upon it being implemented by the Departments?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;63;I do not know why the right hon. Gentleman should suggest that the Departments are not loyally going to carry out this decision. I have had an assurance from both that they intend to do so, and I entirely accept that assurance. What I say is that I cannot prevent individuals over whom I have no authority firing shots if they think fit.
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;19;Is the Prime Minister aware that this matter has been settled before  and reopened again and again after settlement?
1937-7-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-7-30;Fleet Air Arm;2;Yes, Sir.
1952-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-3-12;Commonwealth Migration;60;I think that emigration from this country should be by families and representative of the population as a whole, and not simply that daring and bold men should go.

1954-5-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-5-17;South-East Asia (Defence);10;I think that was very clearly shown in my answer.
1954-5-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-5-17;South-East Asia (Defence);12;Yes, Sir, I am sure that all such matters would be relevant.
1954-5-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-5-17;South-East Asia (Defence);16;That is a point which no doubt will be mentioned in the course of these discussions.
1954-5-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-5-17;South-East Asia (Defence);17;I think I would rather deal with that as a whole, not on that one particular point.

1937-11-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-11-15;Air-Raid Precautions Bill;146;The House has listened with a great deal of good will to the very excellent and well-reasoned speech of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland on this important subject. My hon. Friend has dealt with many of the points which have been advanced in the Debate in a mariner which showed the serious spirit in which he has approached a study of this question. He has indulged in one or two observations the candour and honesty of which we must all greatly appreciate, and upon which I may be called upon to make some observations in the course of to-morrow's Debate. At any rate, when upon a matter which affects our hearths and homes, our lives and freedom we find the Hereditary Standard Bearer of Scotland standing up to commend the Government Measure to us, our hearts are raised to an extremely cordial sense of appreciation.
1955-3-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1955-3-10;Nuclear Weapon Tests (Radioactivity);113;According to paragraph 40 of the official report issued by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on 15th February, the atomic and nuclear tests so far carried out have only released enough radioactive material into the atmosphere to cause an individual living in the United States to receive the same quantity of radiation that he would have received in having his chest X-rayed at a hospital. The experts whose advice is at the disposal of Her Majesty's Government see, I am informed, no reason to dissent from this opinion. All aspects of the nuclear problem and their bearing on international relations must, of course, continue to hold a prime place in our attention.

1944-12-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-14;Dominion Governments (Consultation);142;The hon. Gentleman is mixing up several different kinds of things. Great questions of policy like whether we should go to the aid of Greece after the Germans were driven out, are made manifest to the Dominions by the continued succession of telegrams which are sent from this country, and which give them a perfect, full picture of the situation. The executive measures which are sometimes forced to be taken with the greatest speed, owing to danger to life and limb—these measures it is not possible to refer to Governments all over the world. But they have been kept fully informed of everything that happens as it goes forward, and the Dominions Secretary informs me that I could rightfully say that we have received from the Dominion Governments no indications that they dissent from the action we have been compelled to take.
1944-12-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-14;Dominion Governments (Consultation);106;I am anxious to oblige in every way, especially my hon. Friend, whom I have known so long. I can quite believe that he would receive many telegrams from many parts of the country over a matter which causes so much heart-searching. I gave a long account of this matter to the House the other day, and I may take occasion to give some further account to the country; but we have laid our case very fully before the House, and it was discussed very fully and freely at the Parliamentary Conference yesterday. I have nothing at this moment to add to what has been said.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;117;So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, the export to China is prohibited, except under licence, of the goods set out in the schedules to the Export of Goods (Control) (Consolidation) Order, 1950, as subsequently amended. It is not generally possible to distinguish in the trade returns between exports which have been licensed and those which do not require a licence. Licences have, however, been issued in the last three months for the export to China of about £6,800 of dyestuffs and about £1,250 of other commodities. Licensing arrangements vary considerably from one British Colonial Territory to another. As far as strategic materials are concerned, the Far Eastern Colonies follow the pattern of United Kingdom controls.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;2;Yes, Sir.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;48;As I understand, there has been a prohibition of all major strategic materials. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, there are points where one cannot say when one might have vague, possible, strategic materials, but so far as we can possibly ensure, no strategic materials have been sent.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;60;I understand none. I think a certain misapprehension arose because of the very broad categories used for our exports not only to  China but to other countries and a broad thing such as "vehicles" and so forth might include bicycles, perambulators and the rest but there were, as a matter of fact, no warships, aircraft or anything of the sort.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;19;Yes. I have pointed out we have stopped export of any strategic goods from here and from Hong Kong.

1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;78;I did not blame the hon. Member. I only pointed out that he laboured under a certain misapprehension because of the width of the categories on which the Board of Trade terms are based. Iron and steel manufactures include products from normally finished steel to things like wire mattresses, nails, tacks, rivets, manhole covers and a whole range of very minor matters, and I think there was a distinct misapprehension owing to the categories in the reply given.

Natural rubber was not included in the prohibited and restricted lists originally owing to the great difficulty of control by export licensing, but in the first months of this year it was restricted by administrative action, and since then there have been stricter limitations. That was done in  agreement with the United States of America and finally, in April, there was complete prohibition.

1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;90;I will certainly do it if it is possible. It means very great examination of all the Customs returns and, remember, it means checking up on licences which were given months ago and which have not been brought forward. There is no intention whatever of excluding from the House any knowledge it ought to have, but I think people ought not to suggest by any manner of means, that what has gone from here has been used against our men, because everybody knows the sources of the Chinese army's supplies.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;19;That is rather a different question. I have endeavoured to give the right hon. Gentleman the fullest answer today.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;71;May I make a correction to a statement I made just now? I think I may have overstated the matter. With regard to the exports of rubber, they have been subject to export licensing since 9th April to prevent undue and enlarged quantities being sent to any particular destination. But there has not been, and cannot be I think, an absolute prohibition to see that no rubber whatever gets to China.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;66;It is a question of degree—how much is strategic. As I understand it, it is a matter which has been done in agreement with the Americans. It is really a question of quantities. Obviously large quantities would amount to strategic supplies, but a very small quantity of rubber for particular purposes would not. I understand that is how it is dealt with under the export licensing.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;13;I am not aware of that. I could not answer that without notice.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;24;That is a question which might be put to the President of the Board of Trade. I will try to give the detailed figures.
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;43;I understand the Prime Minister to say that at any rate from now on, the policy in regard to the export of strategic materials will be in full accord, not only on rubber but in other matters, with that of the United States?
1951-5-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-5-03;Exports To China;17;Yes, Sir. That is what I am saying. This was done in accord with the United States.

Gentleman how it was that the usual channels were not informed beforehand of his intention to make a statement of that character late last night; and how it was that full information was given to all his supporters, including the Prime Minister and others, whereas the Conservative Party, and I believe the Liberal Party, were not at all informed that any statement of that kind was to be made? Having regard to the fact that the right hon. Gentleman's statement was intended to be of a conciliatory or deprecatory character, surely it would have been better to extend the usual courtesies.

But may I say to the right hon. Gentleman that I am not at all sure that ordinary discussion through the usual channels will deal with the matter of grave constitutional importance which he has raised. I think it would be better if the discussion took place between himself and me; or himself and some other colleague, and me and another colleague. I do not consider that this is a matter for settlement, as it were, through the two Whips' rooms, excellent and admirable as are their representatives on  both sides. But of course I should be quite ready to receive the right hon. Gentleman—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—my room is on the ground floor anyhow. If there is any point to be made of it we could, of course, meet on neutral ground—accompanied by seconds—to have a discussion on this matter. Certainly it would be very wrong that anybody on either side should refrain from or refuse fully to discuss these matters. Perhaps the point of how, and where and when such a discussion should take place might well be relegated to the usual channels; while the merits and the general decision must be done on a different—I must not say higher—but a different level from that.

I have the greatest respect for the Chair—[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]—and I believe that I shall be accorded the rights which anybody else in my position would have been accorded in former Parliaments. I ask, is not it an obstacle to the beginning of these talks—I quite agree I should put it in interrogative form—that a threat should be used of maltreating, contrary to the merits of their cases, the traders of many different classes in this country as a means of putting pressure on Members of the House of Commons to refuse them their Parliamentary rights and privileges long established by practice and custom of this House? And how does the right hon. Gentleman reconcile such a situation—I am asking  the question—with the proposal for friendly conversations—personally friendly and on general grounds I trust—which the right hon. Gentleman has come to us asking us to begin?

MEMBERS: "Oh."]—of the President of the Board of Trade, as I said, to subject to great hardship large and important sections of manufacturers and others in the country, by denying them their rights and treating them severely, is withdrawn. I do not propose that we should enter into any conversations of a friendly character—[Interruption.]—I do not fear hon. Gentlemen opposite half as much as they fear their fellow countrymen. I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether we can have a withdrawal by the President of the Board of Trade as a prelude to this conversation——
1951-3-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-20;Motions To Annul Orders (Procedure);91;This is really a serious matter. [Interruption.] Is not this really a serious matter, and would it not be a great disadvantage to the House if the possibilities of friendly personal contact came to an end? May I hope that I shall hear from the right hon. Gentleman in the course of the afternoon—[HON. MEMBERS: "NO."]—that I shall hear from him before he expects me to meet him, with or without companions? I hope I shall hear from him that the President of the Board of Trade has withdrawn his threat.

But, after all, this Vote of Censure has been on the Order Paper for some time, and it has been flashed all over the world. When I was in the United States, I can testify to the lively excitement which was created by its appearance, and, although we in this country may have our own knowledge of the stability of our institutions and of the strength of the Government of the day, yet that is by no means the opinion which is shared or felt in other countries. Now that this has gone so far, and this matter has been for more than a week the subject of comment in every part of the world, it would be, in my opinion, even more injurious to delay a decision than to go forward with this issue.

With your consent, Mr. Speaker, and the consent of the House, I am prepared forthwith to nominate hon. Members to serve on the Committee. I am aware that notice is normally required of Motions to nominate members of Committees, but I hope that it will be possible on this occasion to waive this requirement with the consent of the House. Perhaps I should inform the House that the hon. Members whom it is proposed to appoint have been approached and express their willingness to serve on the Committee.

We are obliged to him for accepting the Motion. The matter is not one of a personal character but touches certain principles which should, at any rate, be explored and pronounced upon by the House. With regard to what the right hon. Gentleman said as to the alteration of procedure, we are, of course, in the hands of Mr. Speaker, but on this side of the House we have a strong feeling that this matter should be disposed of as quickly as possible in the interests of all concerned.

1938-7-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-7-26;Air Estimates, 1938;148;The right hon. Gentleman who has just addressed the House has moved a reduction of the Vote and, of course, his business is to put a different point of view from that which the House would expect of me; nevertheless, the right hon. Gentleman did not on this occasion unduly stress disagreement and, in the concluding part of his speech, he said that everybody would agree with what he understood to be the main aim of the Government. I think that must be so. I cannot imagine anyone in any part of the House who would disagree with what we have so frequently declared to be the main aim of the Government's foreign policy, namely, the establishment and the maintenance of peace and the removal, as far as that may be practicable, of all causes of possible conflict in the amelioration of grievances between one country and another.

1938-7-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-26;Air Estimates, 1938;311;I believe that they have had a reply from the Spanish Republican Government, but that they have not yet received a reply from General Franco. Perhaps, however, the House might like to have the latest information about the communications which have been passing between His Majesty's Government and the Burgos authorities about the bombing of British ships in Spanish ports. We sent a communication to the Burgos authorities, who have, the House will remember, declared that it was no part of their policy to make deliberate attacks upon British ships. We sent a communication to them proposing that an immediate investigation should be made into certain cases to which we had already drawn their attention, and in which it appeared to us that the attack  had been, in fact, a deliberate one. We proposed that this investigation should be carried out by two naval officers, one appointed by His Majesty's Government and the other by the Burgos authorities. If they agreed that the attack was deliberate, then the Burgos authorities would make the necessary arrangements to pay immediate compensation to those concerned. If, on the other hand, the two officers were unable to agree, then our proposal was that the matter should be referred to a third party, not of British or Spanish nationality, but who should be agreed upon between the Burgos authorities and ourselves, and that he should make the final decision. We have now received a reply from the Burgos authorities in which they say that, in pursuance of their desire to meet the wishes of His Majesty's Government, they accept this formula and they agree that the investigation we propose should be carried out. We are now considering whether it would not be advisable to send Sir Robert Hodgson back to Spain with instructions which would cover, among other things, the detailed working out of this proposal.

Hon. Members will surely have plenty of opportunity later on of criticising what I am saying, and I think they might at least allow me to finish my sentences. I was saying that we have fulfilled our engagement to take steps at the Council of the League to clarify the position of Member States in regard to the Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia. The right hon. Gentleman stated that the recruiting of Somalis by the Italian forces was taking place in British Somaliland. My information is that he is mistaken. Recruiting has not taken place in British Somaliland—
1938-7-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-26;Air Estimates, 1938;70;Perhaps I may be allowed just to finish this sentence—but a certain amount of recruiting has taken place, not in British Somaliland, but among people whose home is in British Somaliland but who crossed the frontier for purposes of grazing. The Government of British Somaliland have taken all possible steps to prevent recruiting, and it has recently been agreed with the  Italian authorities that no such recruiting shall take place.

1938-7-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-26;Air Estimates, 1938;145;I am sorry I cannot answer that question. I have had no notice of it, and have not the slightest idea to what the right hon. Gentleman is referring. I never heard of it before. I will ask my hon. Friend to make inquiries and, if possible, give the right hon. Gentleman an answer later on. I was saying that we cannot abandon the position we have taken up in regard to the settlement of the Spanish question which we have over and over again declared to the House. But, on the other hand, we profoundly regret this unforeseen delay which has taken place in the completion of the agreement, and we shall do all that we possibly can to facilitate the withdrawal of the foreign volunteers from Spain, in order that that country may cease to offer any threat to the peace of Europe.

Gentleman's present statement that what he means by a settlement in Spain is the volunteers' withdrawal agreement? Hitherto we have not known what he meant by a settlement in Spain. Do I understand now that it is merely a question of volunteers being withdrawn?
1938-7-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-26;Air Estimates, 1938;43;I would like to see what happens when the volunteers are withdrawn.

He will try to acquaint himself with all the facts and the views of the two sides, and he will no doubt see them separately, and perhaps later on he will be able to make some proposals to them which will help them. He is in the position, so well known to the hon. Member, of a man who goes down to assist in settling a strike. He has to see two sides who have come to a point when they cannot go any further. He is there as an independent, impartial person.
1938-7-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-7-26;Air Estimates, 1938;34;That is Lord Runciman's stipulation, and obviously a necessary one. If one side declare that they will have nothing to do with him, it will be quite impossible for him to undertake the task.

We have impressed upon the Government of Czechoslovakia, and also upon the German Government, our own sense of the desirability of restraint. We have noted with satisfaction the efforts which the Czech Government have made, and we have also been very happy to receive assurances, only recently renewed, from the German Government of their own desire for a peaceful solution. The right hon. Gentleman asked me what asurances I had given to the German Ambassador. I was not myself responsible for the exact wording of the communiqué to which the right hon. Gentleman has referred; but it does not mean anything more than I have already told the House of our action in urging the Czechoslovakian Government to try to do all they possibly can, consistent with what they consider essential to their own State, to come to an agreement. On the other side, too, we have continually urged the need for patience in a very delicate and difficult situation.

1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;213;I do not wish to raise a long debate on this Motion. Everybody realises the great strain there has been on the Prime Minister and that he needs a rest, but there are other Ministers beside the Prime Minister, and I think it is important that this House should be kept in Session. The events that are proceeding in Central Europe to-day are being followed with great anxiety by this country, and with increasing disturbance of mind as reports come through. It is a mistake that this House should depart while matters are in such jeopardy, and it is desirable that we should keep the closest watch on events and get the fullest amount of information. I think that this House, although it may be tired, should have regard to the fact that it has its responsibilities and that we have taken on new responsibilities, whether by the guarantee which is to be embodied in a treaty, or whether under what we may call the moral guarantee which has been assumed on behalf of this country by the Prime Minister, and we ought to be here and watchful, doing our business. There is plenty of business to be done. While the Prime Minister is having his rest the House should continue to sit.

After all, we are passing through a period of very rapid daily change in Europe of the most disturbing character, and it does not seem quite right that Parliament should go away for 25 days as if nothing was going on and as if it had lost interest in matters which affect the whole future of this country. It is derogatory to Parliament, it seems to me, that it should be thought unfit as it were to be attending to these grave matters, that it should be sent away upon a holiday in one of the most formidable periods through which we have lived. I know that there is a certain under-current of derision of Parliament even among its own Members, and a feeling no doubt among Ministers "What relief it will be when we have got them sent about their business and we can get on with our work." That is exactly the idea which in other countries has led to the institution of dictatorships, the same process of impatience with the parliamentary machine which has swept it away and has led to its replacement by one-man rule.
1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;215;It will be remembered that the original plea of the Leader of the Opposition was that Parliament should continue to sit and that it was based on four considerations which he put to me. I gave him an answer to those four questions. It was to the effect that I did not think any of them could reasonably be discussed in the immediate present. The request to-day has been put to me on entirely different grounds. Let me say first of all that I have not asked that the House should rise now and not sit again till 1st November on the plea that I wanted a rest. I am not so exhausted that I cannot carry out my duties, whatever they may be. I do not pretend that I am not as fond of a holiday as anyone else. But on this matter, this suggestion that in the next fortnight or three weeks something might happen which is of importance and which this House should have an opportunity of speaking its mind upon—upon that hypothesis I do ask hon. Members to look at the terms of the Motion. The Motion provides for the usual procedure, under which the House can be summoned by Mr. Speaker to meet again if such a situation should arise.

Friend kindly explain why the perfectly innocent question that I put to him, whether it was only on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers that Parliament could  be summoned, should receive from him the wholly inappropriate expression of "unworthy"?
1938-10-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-10-06;Adjournment;179;I will tell my right hon. Friend exactly what I think was unworthy of him. It was not his question just now but the suggestion that he made a few moments ago that Cabinet Ministers would be glad to see the House dispersed in order that they might get on with their business instead of having to face the House. A repetition of tittle-tattle about the way in which Cabinet business is conducted is not doing justice to the sincerity and to the sense of responsibility of Cabinet Ministers. It is true that the House can be called together only on a representation to Mr. Speaker by His Majesty's Government, but that is not to say that we are not fully conscious of the gravity of the times and that we are not fully prepared at any moment, if in our judgment the situation requires it, to give up our holiday and to return at once and answer to the House for anything that we might do. That, really, is a sufficient safeguard for those Members of the House

I am not ill-acquainted with what is the situation in the world. If (b) and (c) in my Question were linked together, and (d) and (e) werelinked together, making only three categories, namely, in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in everything West of the Suez Canal, and in everything East of the Suez Canal, if there were these three main global totals, would any objection be alleged against giving the figures?

I should be very ready to put the question down in a different form, possibly asking for three totals. All we want to know is how many men are being kept here and in the Far East. That is the main fact. One must see where the greatest numbers  lie. That is all I am anxious to adduce. I should be very glad to have a talk with my right hon. Friend afterwards, and to put another Question to him. [Interruption.] An hon. Member asks why I want to know. It is because I want to get the largest number of men out of the Army as soon as possible.

1954-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-6-24;Members' Expenses (Government Decision);110;We have heard with very great regret the statement of the Prime Minister. While there is the technical point about the need for a Government Resolution on a matter involving finance, it has been the practice to accept the decision of the House of Commons. During the time of the Government of which I was Prime Minister, there were two outstanding occasions. One was the suspension of a Member and the other was the question of capital punishment. In both those cases the House took a view contrary to that held by the Government, but the Government felt in duty bound to accept the opinion of the House of Commons.

Gentleman, but neither of them touches the financial question, and therefore the constitutional points which I have put did not arise. There is a definite distinction in the character of the questions. Moreover, if my recollection serves me rightly, no further action was required from the executive Government of the day in consequence of the two votes passed by the House in the cases which the right hon.  Gentleman has mentioned. Events merely rolled upon their course. In this case, definite, responsible, constructive action involving a charge upon the public is called for from the Government.
1954-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-6-24;Members' Expenses (Government Decision);102;The Motion which was put down was put down by hon. Members of several parties in Opposition time. We had no power to prevent it. It was the right of Members of all parties to put it down, and personally I was very much in favour of a free vote being given on the subject, but that does not remove the fact that the Government of the day, representing the Crown in the matter, have the constitutional responsibility for any proposal involving a charge upon the public, and an expression of opinion by the House does not relieve them of their responsibility.
1954-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-6-24;Members' Expenses (Government Decision);82;The right hon. Gentleman will remember that it was as a matter of courtesy that the Opposition provided a Supply Day for the purpose of discussing the Report by a Committee set up by this House—an important Committee representative of Members on both sides—to deal with this matter, and that there was, therefore, an obligation on the Government to give time to discuss the Report. It was purely a matter of courtesy that we allowed it to be taken in our time.
1954-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-6-24;Members' Expenses (Government Decision);30;I think that it would be better, in the general interest, that the right hon. Gentleman should carry out the course he proposed and consult his friends upon the issue.

[HON.MEMBERS: "No."] That is what he said he was going to do, and we shall not settle it by shouting. I think that would be a very great mistake on an issue of this kind. I think that it would be better that he should discuss the matter with his friends, and then give the decision at which he arrives.

Therefore, I thought it perfectly right to make a retort which, I am glad to see, has struck home.

1938-3-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-17;Navy Estimates, 1938;237;I am sure that every one will sympathise with the disappointment which the First Lord must be feeling at being confined to a bed of sickness when he would have so greatly desired to present to the House his first Admiralty statement, but the task has been well and adequately discharged by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, whose statement covered the whole field and who had many interesting announcements to make to us about the interior economy of the Navy and the conditions of its ranks and ratings. I must say that I was astonished to see the state of the House during the Debate this afternoon. My mind goes back to the days before the War when the Navy Estimates were debated in a House which was crowded to the utmost capacity. I have been looking up the Debate of 1913. I see that owing to a political quarrel we did not begin the discussion until 7.30 and the House sat right on through dinner up to eleven o'clock. It may be that hon. Members feel more reassured in their minds about the position of the Navy than they did in those days, or it may possibly be that the fibre of post-war Parliamentary representatives is not up to what it was in the days of old, though perhaps it is discourteous to present such a suggestion otherwise than in the form of an alternative.

Broadly speaking, I venture to say that the course of events this year has done nothing to weaken our confidence in the judgment of the naval experts that great ships of war can be constructed which can exercise their full influence and efficiency under modern conditions, and that the air menace, however seriously it may operate in other directions, will not destroy the validity of sea power.

I gather from him that all the recognised machinery of trade union negotiation was in full operation, and that this was a breakaway unofficial strike, but the Question I really addressed to the right hon. Gentleman dealt rather with the responsibility of the Government for maintaining the services of the House. It is not suitable that the House of Commons and the House of Lords, where the affairs of the whole country have to be dealt with, should be deprived of what are considered to be the regular normal services of this House, and I should like to know what steps the Government propose to take to make sure that these services are resumed at the earliest moment.

Is it possible that that statement is true; and if it is not true, ought it not to be contradicted at the earliest moment?

And have we no means or power to invite an explanation from the Minister?

Is it definitely established that every statutory interference with an execution—every administrative interference with an execution—involves the Royal Prerogative? Are not respites frequently given from week to week when cases have to be considered; and was there not a case only last week, or the week before, of a respite being given for a considerable time by administrative authority? What has that to do with the Royal Prerogative which is involved in the case where a final or formal pardon is concerned? Might I ask for your Ruling, Sir, as between the two quite definite classes of action by which the execution of human beings is stayed?
1947-3-03-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-03;Death Sentences, Gold Coast (Respites);20;No, but has not the Minister the power to respite if he chooses without involving or invoking the Royal Prerogative?

If that were so, would your objection to a Motion for the Adjournment of the House being moved by the hon. Member for Oldham still stand—if it be true that there are cases, and that this is one of those cases where the Royal Prerogative is not invoked, but only the Ministerial responsibility?

Gentleman says, "I will make the strongest representations," and so forth. Everyone knows that his powers over Governors are absolute. His power over their actions may not be absolute, but he can suspend a Governor from his functions. If there is no other way of gaining the time, he should certainly consider that. I have been concerned in these matters over a great many years. Is not this an exhibition of impotence on the part of the head of a great Department that he does not wish men to be executed, yet he does not know whether they will be or not, and says he has no means of sending word from Britain to one of his own officials, an appointed Governor? Is not that a shocking thing? May I ask you, Mr. Speaker, most respectfully, whether you will not give fresh consideration to the request for leave to move the Adjournment submitted by the hon. Member for Oldham (Mr. Hale), this being clearly shown to be not a matter of the Prerogative, but a matter involving the administrative authority of a servant of this House?

1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;57;I gladly concede the Parliamentary principle invoked by the Leader of the Opposition. I only thought that on this occasion it would be more in accordance with the wishes of the House—the answers were of a limited and negative character [HON. MEMBERS: "No."]—to have a general statement and the promise of an opportunity of a full debate.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;60;I am certainly giving, and the other Members of the Government concerned are giving, their close attention to the question of London. I see that the Leader of the victorious Socialist Party in London is also giving his attention to it, since he is very much concerned about the rise in fares resulting from the administration of the party opposite.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;5;That is a big question.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;6;Yes, I have read the report—
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;118;Oh, yes, I am sure I had. As to the very much larger question of whether rail services should be subsidised, that overlooks the fact that for the last three or four years they have been subsidised—[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] They have been subsidised, in fact if not in form, by accumulating a deficit which grows year by year, which deficit is presented only as a matter of book-keeping. It is really a part of the national finances. However, the question of the railways and how they should be enabled to become self-supporting and in proper and true relation with an ever-growing road transport service, is one which might well be ventilated in the debate promised for next Monday.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;43;I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are anxious to do our utmost to protect Londoners, as far as it is possible within the law or within our finances, from the evil consequences they are suffering from the hands of his party.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;10;My hon. Friend will, I am sure, have ample opportunities—
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;25;of giving vent to his feelings and testifying by actions, which are louder than words, not only in the debate but in the Division Lobby.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;9;All that will fit very well into the debate.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;62;I am ashamed to admit that no final decision has yet been taken on that point. However, it would seem to me convenient if we framed a Motion in such a way as—[An HON. MEMBER: "To blame us."]—to enable the party opposite, who are so resolute for the increases in fares, to give a vote in the Lobby when the occasion comes.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;58;I think it is usual for Governments to have the right and option of decision as to how they will dispose of their speakers in particular debates. I have been led to take a great interest in this question, but I think I would prefer to reserve any decision upon this subject until I see how things go.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;36;I think there ought to be a Motion, and that Motion would be moved, and the speech moving it would give rise to a reply—in fact the debate would proceed in very much the ordinary manner.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;13;I think that question should be addressed to the Leader of the House.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;46;Nothing could be better than for the hon. and learned Gentleman to unfold his case in the debate on Monday. I hope I shall not be doing him any injustice if I tell him that my expert information is that he is wrong on both points.
1952-4-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-4-21;Transport Fares Increases;10;I am told it was the spring of last year.
1943-3-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-25;European Post-War Recon- Struction (Personnel);53;The personnel to assist individual European Governments in the reconstruction of their countries will be recruited internationally. Until the number of British subjects required by such international agencies can be more accurately assessed, His Majesty's Government consider it inadvisable to initiate training schemes which would interfere with the war-time occupation of the candidates.
1943-3-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-3-25;European Post-War Recon- Struction (Personnel);11;I am speaking, of course, of what the Government will do.
1939-11-01-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-11-01;Submarines (Eire Coast);50;So far as the territorial waters of Eire are concerned, the responsibility rests exclusively with the Government of that country. Outside these waters on the high seas, the Royal Navy are taking such measures as are open to them, and I can assure the House they are doing their best.
1950-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-10-24;Motion For Address In Reply;17;Mr. Speaker, I rise to move an Address in reply to His Majesty's Gracious Message as follows: 
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;95;An answer to this Question would depend on an accurate assessment of a variety of immeasurables. I am advised that from our present knowledge the number of major experimental explosions required to produce lethal risks over an area beyond that immediately affected by the explosion would be very large indeed. On the most cautious assumptions it would be, so I am advised, considerably greater than the number which could conceivably be employed in any tests likely to be made by the Powers who possess these weapons. Investigation into this problem is proceeding actively and continuously.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;16;I have not had an opportunity of verifying the quotation to which the hon. Member refers.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;17;I do not think it would be within my power to take a decision of that kind.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;80;There have been a number of experiments of which record has reached us of explosions in Russia, and then there were those which took place a year ago under the authority of the United States. But it is one thing to form a view about what would be the most agreeable course to be pursued in these matters by either of these two countries and quite another thing to persuade them, still more to compel them, not to have tests.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;53;I am sure that it would have been a very good thing if none of these things had ever been discovered at all. At what stage in their discovery they should be arrested, and with what advantage to particular nations that are experimenting in them, is a much more complicated question to decide.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;85;We have a great deal of information on this extremely complex question and we are continuing  to pursue our researches intensively. As the hon. Member will now be aware, Her Majesty's Government, together with others, have proposed that an international conference of scientists on atomic energy be organised during the coming summer, and a resolution to this effect is now under discussion in the Political Committee of the United Nations. This conference will doubtless consider, among other matters, the effects of radiation on human beings.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;28;I am quite sure that all the information which is available here and in the United States on such aspects is at the disposal of our expert authorities.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;22;I should like to see what they were before I even imagined that I had the authority to decide such a question.
1954-11-09-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-11-09;Nuclear And Atomic Explosions;63;The hon. and learned Gentleman might, with all his eloquence and learning, go to both the Americans and the Russians—[An HON. MEMBER: "The right hon. Gentleman is Prime Minister."]—and suggest to them that they should alter the course on which they have embarked, but whether or not that would result in anything more than an abrupt termination of the talk, I cannot tell.
1950-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-12-07;Troops, Malaya (Christmas Parcels);11;What is the financial saving involved in this somewhat refined discrimination?
1950-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-12-07;Troops, Malaya (Christmas Parcels);34;If there is no serious financial cost involved, would it not be better to simplify the matter and treat all the same, having regard to the action extorted from the right hon. Gentleman yesterday?
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);13;Perhaps the man has a C licence and cannot carry the empties himself.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);2;Hear, hear.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);7;I have it down in my notes.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);10;Would the right hon. Gentleman rather I did not speak?
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);7;What was the date of the letter?
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);34;The letter was written after the White Paper was published? That was only a few days ago. Very often it is courteous to send a formal acknowledgment pending a more reasoned reply later on.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);67;I am very glad to hear any reassurances of that kind, and I am willing to accept them for what they are worth. But we should certainly not be afraid to join issue with the party opposite on this ground. If the threat or act of public duty were taken seriously it would, of course, affect the value of the national property which we propose to sell.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);7;The hon. Member is repeating smoking-room gossip.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);3;Who are "they"?
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);6;Twelve thousand three hundred and forty-eight.
1952-5-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-21;Transport (Government Policy);7;That is a dirty thing to say.
1947-2-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-2-06;Industrial Fuel And Power Needs;60;On a point of Order. I presume that as we are now to have a Debate on the Adjournment, hon. Members are perfectly free to raise such topics as they choose if they are fortunate enough to catch your eye? Therefore, this matter would be quite relevant to the Debate we are to take this afternoon if hon. Members choose?
1949-1-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-20;Newspaper Article (Minister's Statement);25;It is quite clear from the statement which the Minister has volunteered that the onus in this matter lies very directly upon the newspaper concerned.
1945-3-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1945-3-28;Earl Lloyd-George Of Dwyfor, Om;186;Mr. Speaker, shortly after David Lloyd George first took Cabinet office as President of the Board of Trade, the Liberals who had been in eclipse for 20 years obtained in January, 1906, an overwhelming majority over all other parties. They were independent of the Irish; the Labour Party was in its infancy; the Conservatives were reduced to little more than 100. But this moment of political triumph occurred in a period when the aspirations of 19th century Liberalism had been largely achieved. Most of the great movements and principles of Liberalism had become the common property of enlightened men all over the civilised world. The chains had been struck from the slave; a free career was open to talent; the extension of the franchise was moving irresistibly forward; the advance in education was rapid and continuous, not only in this island but in many lands. Thus at the moment when the Liberal Party became supreme, the great and beneficent impulses which had urged them forward were largely assuaged by success. Some new and potent conception had to be found by those who were called into power.
1942-9-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-9-29;Madagascar (Operations);50;The success of the initial landings and the fact that they were accomplished with only the lightest casualties to both sides were due in great measure to the efficiency of the Royal Navy and the speed with which they ferried the troops on to the beaches at the right time.
1942-9-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-9-29;Madagascar (Operations);7;I think the resistance was mainly symbolic.
1951-6-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-07;Division No 86 (Incident);123;We naturally accept and support the report which you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, have made upon this matter and I was very glad to hear the remarks which were made in such a becoming strain by the Leader of the  House. From the information which has reached me, it appears that several Ministers of high standing and importance in the Government took an active part in those proceedings. I am not mentioning their names because of the terms of the remarks by the Leader of the House, but it does appear they did take a part and I trust we may assume they are included among those who have apologised to my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East for their unparliamentary and improper behaviour.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);22;Yes, Sir. I am glad to take this opportunity of explaining the position of Members of Parliament under the National Service Acts.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);12;I think I can safely reassure my hon. Friend on that point.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);36;I do not think the question is one of favour, but rather of the discharge of important duties. Those duties, as I have several times pointed out, are sometimes better discharged by silence than by speech.
1941-12-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-11;National Service Acts (Members Of Parliament);18;Some people, by their absence, contribute as much to the progress of our affairs as by their presence.
1943-4-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-4-13;British Empire (Economic Policy);54;It is, of course, the established policy to maintain the closest co-operation and contact with the Governments of the Empire on all economic questions of common concern. Having regard, however, to the responsibility which must rest with the respective Governments and Parliaments, a centralized executive body such as that suggested would not be practicable.
1944-3-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-3-30;Clause 82—(Remuneration Of Teachers);31;I thought that the Noble Lord was addressing the whole Committee and not particularly addressing me. I very often notice him engaged in active conversation himself, no doubt on public business.
1944-3-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-30;Clause 82—(Remuneration Of Teachers);19;If I should find myself in that position, I would gladly give an answer to my right hon. Friend.
1944-3-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-30;Clause 82—(Remuneration Of Teachers);25;The hon. Gentleman should not talk about backwoodsmen. Many hon. Members on the back benches are doing public work and are often in the Services.
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 27—(Effect Of Capitalisation Of Profits On Rate Of Profits Tax);58;This frivolous performance gave me the strange impression, perhaps not altogether inappropriate to the hour at which we are sitting, that we were listening to a sleep-talker. I would ask the Leader of the House to reply to the request that has been formally made to him by my right hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Lyttelton).
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 27—(Effect Of Capitalisation Of Profits On Rate Of Profits Tax);84;Might not the House have been informed of that fact before the decision was taken, because it certainly might have made a difference to the decision if the machinery of the House has broken down under the strain put upon it?—[Interruption.]—On a point of order, might I ask the Minister whether we could be informed what time it was known that this was broken down? Is it not rather a serious matter that Members should not have the bells ringing in the regular way?
1951-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-11;Clause 27—(Effect Of Capitalisation Of Profits On Rate Of Profits Tax);16;I should be very churlish if I did not make my acknowledgment to you, Major Milner.
1943-3-31-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-31;Road Traffic Regulation;118;While it is possible that a Regulation in similar terms might have been made under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1930, that provision was designed for the regulation of traffic in peace-time in the interests of public safety and the prevention of damage to road surfaces, and it would have been inappropriate to use it to meet a war-time need for which it was never intended. The sole purpose of the Order to which my hon. friend refers is to conserve rubber as a measure of war economy and as such it is appropriate that it should be made under the Defence Regulations. The suggestion in the second part of the Question does not therefore arise.
1943-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-06;Ministers' Salaries (Income Tax);55;This matter was discussed by the House during the Debates on the Ministers of the Crown Bill, 1937. Undoubtedly, the  position as stated by my hon. Friend discloses a case requiring consideration, in respect of junior Ministers. The Government have not, up to the present, felt themselves able to make any recommendation to the House.
1943-7-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1943-7-06;Ministers' Salaries (Income Tax);6;I hope that is personal experience.
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Dock Strikes;80;:I have to put a Question to the Minister of Labour, of which I have given Private Notice. May I say that at the request of the Minister of Labour I have put this Question off from day to day for some time, but I gather that now it is not inopportune for* me to put the Question to the right hon. Gentleman. Has the Minister of Labour any statement to make with regard to the position at the docks?
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Dock Strikes;26;Are we right in assuming that all necessary military labour will be used to avert a food catastrophe through the non-arrival of essential and perishable supplies?
1945-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-10-30;Dock Strikes;4;I am much obliged.
1954-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-10-21;Nuclear Weapons (Soviet Experiments);34;As I have said before, it would not be in the public interest to disclose the extent of our information relating to Russian nuclear weapon experiments. The subject continues to occupy our unceasing attention.
1954-10-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-10-21;Nuclear Weapons (Soviet Experiments);14;I am not able to impose any time limit on these prospects or proceedings.
1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);30;His Majesty's Government are aware of the transport of Swedish iron-ore to Germany and of its importance to Germany, but the arrest of such traffic would involve many serious considerations.
1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);18;We are always giving prolonged consideration to the matter, but so far I have not taken any steps.
1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);14;I would confine myself to saying that all relevant matters are constantly being considered.
1940-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-3-06;Swedish Iron-Ore (German Imports);10;I think it is pretty well on the same lines.
1954-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-12-07;German Armaments And Troops (Second World War);132;It has not been found possible to find the text of any message sent by me to Field Marshal Montgomery in May, 1945, concerning captured German arms. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find it. I will, of course, publish in the OFFICIAL REPORT any result should it be achieved. I certainly proposed around this time that the destruction of captured German arms should be delayed and my telegrams have been published. With regard to Question No. 51, in the name of the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Mr. Warbey), Field Marshal Montgomery has also reported to me that no arrangements of this kind were ever discussed between him and Field Marshal von Busch and no German armed forces were maintained in being after their unconditional surrender.
1954-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-12-07;German Armaments And Troops (Second World War);54;As to people being profoundly shocked, of course some people are very hard up to find something to talk about. As to the question about Field Marshal Montgomery, I think the hon. Member is stealing a march on the hon. Member for Dudley (Mr. Wigg) who has already got a Question down for Thursday.
1954-12-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-12-07;German Armaments And Troops (Second World War);18;If the hon. Gentleman will put that on the Order Paper, I will give it very careful consideration.
1937-12-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-12-20;Armed Forces (Gas-Masks);7;We might have an answer to that.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;13;I desire, with permission, to make a statement in reply to Question 49.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;17;I am not aware that Mr. Hayter gave expression to anything except general approval of the plan.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;54;I am sure that we have all listened with great interest to the statement which the Prime Minister has made. May I ask him if this statement has been collated with or is to be read in accordance with the other statement issued this morning by the National Eexcutive Committee of the Labour Party?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;113;The Labour Party document to which the right hon. Gentleman refers is a general statement of party policy, and it sets out, in the section on the problem of the basic industries, what the party considers to be the ultimate necessities of a fully developed scheme of European co-operation in this field. But the Government have always made clear both at the O.E.E.C. and elsewhere that they are fully prepared to co-operate in the closer integration of the European economy with other countries which hold different economic views. The Labour Party document is not, of course, a statement of Government policy in this matter. Government policy is as I have just now stated.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;103;It is evident, I am sure, that we should have a discussion on this matter at an early date. It is very complicated, and we have two versions presented to us of the policy of the party opposite. There are also many difficult aspects of this question. May I ask the right hon. Gentleman if we can have a Debate on this matter next week? I do not think it should be left too long in view of the uncertainties there are. May I also ask whether the Prime Minister will publish a White Paper—I think he intends to do so—containing the text—
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;30;I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman quite caught what I said. I said that a White Paper was being published. It was available at 3.30 this afternoon.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;80;I am very much obliged. I presume that the Prime Minister will give us an opportunity of discussing this matter next week. I am sure that everyone will welcome the opportunity. Meanwhile, may I assure the right hon. Gentleman of the sympathy we all feel with him in his position as the only Socialist Prime Minister, outside the Iron Curtain and Scandinavia, in the whole of Europe, the whole British Commonwealth of Nations or the whole of the English-speaking world.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;61;Regarding the last point of the right hon. Gentleman, I would remind him that during the war he was the only Conservative Prime Minister among the Allies and in the British Commonwealth and he was indebted to strong support from the Labour Governments in the Commonwealth. With regard to his first question, perhaps the Lord President of the Council will reply.

1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;76;The question of having any Debate, and so on, is suitable to the usual channels, but Parliament has its rights in regard to whether large questions should be debated on particular occasions; and is not this exactly a topic on which the House of Commons should express an opinion? May not we have an assurance—apart from any discussions through the usual channels—that we will be given an opportunity next week when we can discuss this matter?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;8;The right hon. Gentleman is not the judge.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;121;Does not the proposal suggested by the right hon. Gentleman give him or the Government absolutely indefinite power of delaying a Debate on this matter? They have only to say, "We do not know all the facts and so we will put off the Debate." But the House is the judge and not the Government of whether a Debate should take place upon a grave public matter, and I ask expressly and explicitly that this matter should be discussed next week. As to the right hon. Gentleman saying, "Take one of your Supply Days," that really is not worthy of a Government which, although it has only a majority of four or five, still presumes to rule over these vast spheres.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;42;That brings out the difficulty of discussing this plan. There are no details whatever. This is a sketch of a great idea, but it has not  yet been filled out in any detail, and I cannot give an answer to that question.

1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;54;In a matter of this kind it really is not for us to ask the French Government to put themselves out for the convenience of this House. This House should debate the matter at the right time when they get the information, and in due course we shall get notice from the French Government.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;20;I do not think there was time for any consultation. This is a specific invitation addressed to His Majesty's Government.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;46;Is it not, instead of a discussion of these detailed proposals, rather an account which we require of the negotiations which have taken place  and of the Government's action and policy and the general principles by which they will be guided in any discussion of detail?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;63;If the hon. Member will read the statement I have made in this House, he will see that the attitude of His Majesty's Government is perfectly clear. We accept this as a great idea, but it is quite impossible for us at present to accept it in all its details—or indeed the exact principle—before we know how it will work out in fact.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;150;I entirely agree. The only point we have made is that if it is to be a fruitful discussion, it should be a discussion on definite proposals. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman can see the implications of this scheme or indeed the general framework of the scheme at present. I cannot. I think we should do better when we know more about it. That is the only point. There is no intention whatever of avoiding a Debate. This is a matter of very great importance to this country, to Europe and to the world. If the right hon. Gentleman will consider the matter carefully, I think he will see that a mere Debate in the void on some general question of what we can do on this matter would not take us very far without seeing more in detail what the French Government have in mind.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;83;Surely it may be a long time before the French Government, having had only preliminary pourparlers with other countries, are in a position to state their detailed proposals? Are not the detailed proposals of the French Government to be put forward as a basis of discussion among a large number of Powers to be assembled round a table? How long is all that going to take? Are we really to be denied a Debate in Government time upon an issue of this importance?
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;12;I understand that the meeting is to take place on the 20th.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;126;If the right hon. and learned Gentleman will read the White Paper, he will see exactly what took place. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman thinks that we should have accepted this position and bound ourselves to agree to something about which we had no details, that is a matter which he might debate; but as I understand the position, the general view expressed in this country is that we should like to see more details before we bind ourselves. It was not the case that we refused to go to a round-table conference. We were perfectly willing. We were not prepared to go to a round-table conference binding ourselves to do certain things which we might have found we were not able to do.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;86;Would not it be very easy and appropriate for the right hon. Gentleman to expound at greater length in a Debate what he has just been saying in answer to the last question? The Government have to declare and explain their conduct in relation to these matters as far as they are known to us. To say  that we shall have to wait until the cut-and-dried detailed proposals agreed upon by all the different countries can be placed before us is, I think, very abusive treatment.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;122;All I say to the right hon. Gentleman is that he is again mistaken about what I said. I never suggested that we should wait until agreed and cut-and-dried proposals have been reached by all the Governments. What I did suggest was that we might see what was the actual scheme put forward. I suggest that if the right hon. Gentleman would read the White Paper first of all, he would see the course of the discussions. My statement today will not add much to what is in the White Paper, which sets out, I think very clearly and in a way which can be understood on both sides, exactly the reasons why we could not go in with our hands bound.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;57;I was not prejudging the issue, because it requires very careful consideration in many of its different aspects, but I do ask that we should now have a Debate next week promised to us. It would be a proper thing in a matter of this extreme importance for the Government to have the Debate in their time.
1950-6-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-6-13;Schuman Plan;16;We do not want to embarrass the discussions by putting forward proposals ourselves at this time.

1951-3-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-3-08;Complaint Of Privilege;104;Another point which seems to me to make it important that the debate should be adjourned and that the House should consider precedents before they submit the complaint to the Committee of Privileges is that a member of another place is involved. The Right Reverend Bishop of Rochester is a peer. Surely it would be only reasonable and decorous for us to be sure that we had not in any way infringed the privileges of another place before we decide offhand to remit the matter to the Committee of Privileges in which the conduct of a member of another place will be directly involved.

1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;266;I believe it will be the general wish of the House that I should initiate a Debate on Foreign Affairs this afternoon by making a statement as to the attitude of His Majesty's Government as affected by recent events in Europe. I deliberately choose the word "attitude" rather than "policy," because I cannot imagine that any events would change the fundamental basis of British foreign policy which is the maintenance and preservation of peace and the establishment of a sense of confidence that peace will, in fact, be maintained. That must, I think, always be the aim of any Government of this country, because, as has so often been said, peace is the greatest interest of the British Empire. But that does not mean that nothing would make us fight. We are bound by certain Treaty obligations which would entail upon us the necessity of fighting if the occasion arose, and I hope no one doubts that we should be prepared, in such an event, to fulfil those obligations. Then there are certain vital interests of this country for which, if they were menaced, we should fight—for the defence of British territories and the communications which are vital to our national existence. There are other cases, too, in which we might fight, if we were clear that either we must fight or else abandon, once and for all, the hope of averting the destruction of those things which we hold most dear—our liberty and the right to live our lives according to the standards which our national traditions and our national character have prescribed for us.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;182;I am sure they recognise the source from which I have drawn those words. They might, indeed, have come from a speech of my own, but, as a matter of fact, they are drawn from a leading article, and, I think in the circumstances, I should say a courageous article, in the "Daily Herald." I hope hon. Members opposite will be prepared to accept from their own organ what, perhaps, I could hardly expect them to accept from me, and that they will be willing to face to-day these hard facts. Since I am looking now, not for differences, but for agreement, may I not hope that hon. Members opposite will also agree with me that the best thing we could do for the League would be to nurse it back to health, not only because its original aims were right, but because, if only we could make It wide enough and strong enough to fulfil the functions for which it was originally designed, it might yet become the surest and most effective guarantee for peace that the world has yet devised?
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;230;Everybody in this House will agree that our aim is the preservation of peace, but an aim is not the same as a policy. You may aim at peace, but you may differ as to the policy which is to secure peace. I thought that right from the start the Prime Minister was confused in his mind between aims and policies, and having followed his speech out very closely I could not discern anything in it in the nature of a policy which made for peace. I could not find any approach to any policy to establish peace on firm foundations. I found the acceptance of certain principles, and then I found them immediately discarded. I found the Prime Minister stating very strongly the principle that the rule of force should give way to the rule of law, that he did not believe in the arbitrament of force, but in actual fact he yields to force all the time. He is proceeding on a policy of negotiation with persons who have shown their belief in force and who exercise force even while he is negotiating with them. I am really surprised that a Prime Minister who experienced what our Prime Minister experienced recently in his negotiations with Germany and the occurrence in Austria, despite all the professions which we had of good faith, should express himself with that amazing credulity.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;93;Perhaps the hon. and gallant Member will read my speech in the morning. I was not dealing at that moment with the point which he made. Perhaps he did not quite follow me. I was dealing with the importance of basing peace in the world on the preservation of moral principle, and I said that that brought an immense force behind those who believed in the League of Nations. I was emphasising the difference between an alliance of the old time and a definite alliance in support of the principles of the League.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;178;During all these years the situation has been steadily slipping down into world anarchy again, and no real effort has been made to deal with the causes that make war. We hold that changes may be necessary. They may be changes in the political organisation of Europe, but they should not be brought about by the brute force of one Power acting on its own. They should be brought about by consultation between Powers who have come together on the basis of consultation, and not on the basis of the mere exercise of force. We believe in the maintenance of force, not to keep things in an uneasy equilibrium, but to deal with the causes of war; above all, with the economic causes of war. When we discussed this matter in December last, the Prime Minister said that it was better  to try to settle the political difficulties before we dealt with the economic difficulties. He has not been very successful with the political difficulties. Perhaps he had better turn and try to deal with the economic difficulties.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;31;The right hon. Baronet's memory has misled him. The observations to which he is referring were not directed to the conference at all; they were directed to the system of alliances.
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;4;What does that prove?
1938-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-24;Foreign Affairs And Rearmament;152;The Prime Minister, in what I think it is not presumptuous for me to describe as a very fine speech, set before us the object which is in all our minds, namely, how to prevent war. A country like ours, possessed of immense territory and wealth, whose defences have been neglected, cannot avoid war by dilating upon its horrors, or even by a continuous display of pacific qualities, or by ignoring the fate of the victims of aggression elsewhere. War will be avoided, in present circumstances, only by the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor. If our defences are weak, we must seek allies and, of course, if we seek allies, as my right hon. Friend and "landlord" the Member for South Molton (Mr. Lambert) has pointed out, alliances involve commitments. But the increase of commitments may be justified if it is followed by a still greater increase of deterrents against aggression.

1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);85;In the Debate on the Address, we had every reason to suppose that the Government would resist the proposals of Mr. Costello's Government to sever the last tenuous link with the Crown, and that the Southern Irish would be confronted with all the difficulties which would arise in respect of the nationality of Irishmen in Great Britain and of the British in Ireland, and also in all matters connected with preference and trade relations. Now it appears from the statement which has just been made——
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);43;Further to that point of Order. I submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that when a statement of this momentous character is made by the Government, some statement of the position of the Opposition, naturally confined within moderate limits, is permissible and is customary.
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);117;I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention, and, addressing myself with great particularity to the Question whether we should now adjourn, may I be permitted to say that, whereas in the Debate on the Address we had every reason to believe that His Majesty's Government intended to raise all these issues of nationality and  preference if the Dublin Government decided to sever this last tenuous link, they have now abandoned that position. They are going to acquiesce in arrangements which leave the Southern Irish in full enjoyment of any advantages there may be in being connected with the British Empire and Commonwealth without having any reciprocal obligations of their own towards it.
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);45;In reply to the right hon. Gentleman, there is no change whatever in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. It was, I thought, quite unnecessary for me to repeat the statement I made in this House as recently as 28th October, in which I said:

1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);7;I felt bound to make a statement.
1948-11-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-11-25;Eire (Relations With Commonwealth);244;Further to that point of Order. I am bound to say that these questions have been put to you, as you know, Sir, on a very serious statement which has been made by the Government Front Bench. It was a statement of policy on which, evidently, something was required to be said to indicate the position of the Opposition. Undoubtedly, it raises difficult questions as to exactly what should be said, or at what length such a statement may be made. I fear that, in what I was saying, I may perhaps have used language a little more definite than should have characterised an ordinary statement in response to a Government declaration, but I do think that this is a matter of great, and even of historic, importance. My hon. and right hon. Friends behind me who are associated with me feel that their position must be safeguarded at this stage in the interests of the House, and it was in that sense that I ventured to trespass, but I am grateful to the Chief Whip for having moved the Motion for the Adjournment, which, of course, placed me in Order. I trust that my hon. and right hon. Friends on this side will make sure that the progress of Government Business is not hampered or prolonged as the result of the Chief Whip having moved the Adjournment as an act of courtesy, and also, I think, for the general convenience of the House.

On Monday, I thought that the microphone was much more powerful than it had been before, and my opinion was shared by a number of hon. Members with whom I talked. It causes a reverberation which makes it very difficult for the speaker to modulate his voice in accordance with the accidents of Debate. Therefore, I asked my right hon. Friend the Chief Opposition Whip whether there had been any change, and he told me that the microphone had been geared up over the weekend and made more strong. All I asked was whether there could be a return to the normal practice of last week, and the previous week before I spoke. But, by some error, it was turned off altogether. I hope I made myself heard to the House, and I make my apologies to the "gods" in the Gallery for any inconvenience they may have suffered.

1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;284;This Debate was originally fixed to take place last week. I should like to begin by expressing my regret to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite that, owing to my personal physical weakness, I was not able to be present on that occasion, and also my appreciation of their courtesy in consenting to postpone the Debate until I was able to take my place here again. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Bishop Auckland (Mr. Dalton) began his speech by complaining that we have treated the Motion as a Vote of Censure, but I think  he will see that it was inevitable that we should do so owing to the terms in which it is couched. Although it does not actually declare that this House has no confidence in the Government, there are in the terms of the Motion two implications which come as near as no matter to the same thing. The first implication is that the condition of the country's air defences and the administration of those defences by the Air Ministry are so bad that a searching inquiry is necessary; and the second implication is that the Government cannot be trusted to make that inquiry itself, but that the inquiry must be handed over to some outside, independent, or, as the hon. Gentleman said, impartial body. What is that but want of confidence? If the hon. Gentleman had confidence in the Government, he would not require to take the matter out of their hands and give it to somebody else. I think it is a little unreasonable of hon. Gentlemen opposite to put down a Motion in those terms and then complain that we treat it as a Vote of Censure.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;151;I heard a speech lasting more than an hour from the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland, and I think it is a little early to begin interruptions of my speech, especially as I am not now saying anything which is controversial or provocative. I put it to hon. Members that no Government can dispense with its own responsibility for the efficiency of the Defence Services of the Crown. I put it to them that what is wanted at this moment is not any digging up of the past or attempts to place the fault, if fault there be, here or there. What we want is a continuous review by the man who is principally responsible—that is, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air —of all the circumstances of the case and the devotion of his whole mind to the removal of faults and the prosecution of the programme.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;10;What does the hon. Member mean to imply by that?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;9;Is the hon. Member trying to depreciate its performance?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;291;I will not argue that, and I am not saying that that is the normal speed. I did not say so. I was going on to say that the pilot was able  to find his way and steer a correct course by his instruments alone and that that showed that, while we have developed these great speeds, we have not neglected the question of safety or of adaptability. It is interesting to compare the speeds that are being achieved to-day with those which were achieved only a comparatively short time ago, and, of course, when the hon. Gentleman compares the output of aeroplanes to-day with the output of aeroplanes during the War he is comparing two things which are as different from one another as chalk from cheese. The Bulldog squadron which was formed long after the War in 1929 had a top speed of 163 miles an hour; the first squadron of Gauntlets which was formed in 1935 had a top speed of 230 miles an hour; but now we are well over speeds of 300 miles an hour, and the Spitfire, to which I think the hon. Member alluded, is, I am informed, the fastest fighter in service squadrons anywhere in the world. [Interruption.] It is shortly coming into service. In speaking of bombers, I cannot, of course, disclose the range of the bomb loads of the latest types, but those which are now in service are, I understand, the fastest bombers in the world, and the new types which are now on order show such a marked advance in all respects upon those which are now in service that I think it is very unlikely that their performance will be surpassed by the bombers of any other country.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;10;Will my right hon. Friend say how often it meets?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;216;Continuously; it is in continuous session. Let me explain to the House how this committee works. In the case of every one of these commodities —-and I have given only some—it assesses what would be the probable demand for that commodity in wartime, based, of course, on certain hypotheses as to the conditions of the war. It has inspected hundreds of factories all through the country. It has now allocated the capacity for each of these commodities, and where the capacity does not fully exist it has taken, or is taking, steps to supply the deficiency. It handles all questions of priority as between one Department and another, and that covers not only materials but labour. It has the closest relation with industry because it has on it representatives of industry, leading men who are in close touch with it and who act, in fact, as chairmen of some of its subcommittees. This is an organisation which was founded as long ago as 1924. It has been gradually building up this system. There was nothing like it before 1914, before the Great War, and I am bound to say that I find great difficulty in seeing how it will be possible to improve upon it to-day for the particular purposes for which it has been constituted.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;122;It has to be a great deal more than that if it is to be an improvement on the present system. I submit to hon. Members that you can do a great deal to-day by persuasion, by voluntary effort, and by co-operation with labour and with employers; but if you want to produce the sort of effect you had in the Great War, when the Government had absolute control over the whole of industry throughout the country, you must give this ministry the same sort of powers. I would remind hon. Members that among those powers were not only the power of controlling factories, but the power of relaxing trade union practices and regulations, the power over strikes, the power over dilution—
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;108;That is what I am pointing out. I think we can do what we want without. What I am saying is that I do not think it is any use setting up a ministry of supply with the same limited powers that we have already. If  you want to go further than that you must have these further powers over industry and over labour, and I doubt very much whether we should be justified in asking for such powers, or whether, if we did ask for them, Parliament would give us them in time of peace. The analogy of wartime is really misleading. We are not at war.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;28;What I said was that my right hon. Friend's record guaranteed that he would give all his energy and ability, and lose no opportunity of remedying any deficiencies.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;204;We are debating a Motion for an inquiry into the state and condition of air defence, and I must say that the various postponements, and the changes which have taken place, have introduced new features into the argument. The inquiry was demanded for two purposes—first, to fix responsibility for the failures of the past; and secondly, to stimulate more vigorous action in the future. The second of these purposes must be assumed, to some extent at any rate, to be fulfilled by the appointment of a new Minister. Everyone wishes my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Air success. He brings, as the Prime Minister said, high administrative experience, abilities that we all know, and House of Commons experience—he brings it all to his difficult task. We are all sure that he will try his best, and that he will not spare himself in any way. The very fact of appointing a new Minister means that the whole structure and work of the Department will be  surveyed and scrutinised from a new point of view, and the public and Parliamentary criticism, which is rife at this moment, must necessarily be extremely effective at the time when this new survey is being made.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;4;What date was that?
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;5;The date is 7th March.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;3;Before the Anschluss.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;89;With great respect, the Prime Minister must not use arguments that are not relevant to the issue. The Government have promised air parity with Germany. What relation has that got to the Anschluss? The question of our air strength is not influenced from day to day and hour to hour by the accidents and changes that take place in Europe. Let me read to the House—for I think we have some grievance in this matter—a statement made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Coordination of Defence: 
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;131;I think that makes it worse. It is one of those statements which, apart from the purport, you can just claim to be literally true, but when it is presented to Parliament it has just the effect complained of in the statement of the Secretary of State for War yesterday, of having a thoroughly soothing, reassuring effect on the general public, while, at the same time, it in no way represents the actuality of the position. Everybody listening to that would have thought that the trouble was over, and that the great flow of new machines was coming forward 22 months ago. Yet it is not until 31st March, 1939, that we are to have even 1,750 first-line aeroplanes. I have dealt with the interruption made by my right hon. Friend.
1938-5-25-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-5-25;Air Defences;5;By committees of the Council.
1954-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-6-23;Foreign Affairs (Korea And Indo-China);93;Does not my hon. Friend think that it is a rather fine thing on the part of Members of this Committee and members of former Governments that they should adhere to great acts of policy in which they have been concerned even after they ceased to be responsible, even if there is no popularity to be got out of them? I have paid compliments to those who have gained a great deal of help and support from Dr. Adenauer and have not cast acts of faith away as if they were worth nothing.
1944-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-11-17;Overseas Forces (Home Leave Scheme);35;I have two statements, which, with permission, I should like to make to the House. The first concerns a scheme which we have been working out for a system of short leave for troops overseas.
1944-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-11-17;Overseas Forces (Home Leave Scheme);98;Of course, it includes Burma; the South East Asia Command, indeed, is principally concerned at this time with Burma. As far as local leave in theatres of war is concerned, that is a matter for the Commanders-in-Chief, and much is done to give a break and change to the officers and men who are in this heavy fighting. But I am looking forward to a period, which I cannot forecast now, when it will be possible to introduce something like a short leave to England scheme from France and Germany such as we had in the last war.
1944-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-11-17;Overseas Forces (Home Leave Scheme);50;This campaign only opened on 6th June, and though it has been one of great severity, it has not reached the point where we can withdraw anyone from the front, even for a short leave period, least of all now that the battle has become general along the whole front.

1954-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-7-07;Anglo-American Talks;57;When President Eisenhower and I drew up our statement we were very conscious that some nations would be offended by being included in a list, and some by being excluded. There was a maxim which I was taught, when I was a young officer some years ago, which occurs to me now: "No names, no pack drill."
1954-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-7-07;Anglo-American Talks;50;I think that illustrates how undesirable it is to state a list of names and for two countries meeting together, as we did, in discussion to do more than express a general opinion and not deliberately pick and choose who are in and who are out of a particular list.
1954-7-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-7-07;Anglo-American Talks;14;I do not think so. We are both so firmly based on fundamental principles.

1950-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-4-27;Railway Freight Charges (Increase);111;May I ask the Lord President of the Council on the question of debate in connection with this matter whether he will consider the following: We are now informed or given notice, that on 15th May a new tax of £27 million a year will be put upon the public and upon industry by raising the rates of freights on the railways—£27 million a year which is almost half the tax we voted on yesterday. Is there any reason why the House of Commons should not have an opportunity in Government time and on Government responsibility of debating so heavy an additional charge on the life and activity of the nation?
1950-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-4-27;Railway Freight Charges (Increase);2;They were.

1950-4-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-4-27;Railway Freight Charges (Increase);90;Does this not constitute a very great abrogation of Parliamentary liberties and of the duty of the House of Commons to deal with burdens laid upon the public and money extracted from them? Here is the right hon. Gentleman. imposing a tax of £27 million in a year. [HON. MEMBERS: " It is not a tax." It is in all except the name a tax on the public, and the right hon.

1941-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-6-11;Dominion Prime Ministers (Co-Operation);64;I should warmly welcome a meeting of Dominion Prime Ministers should this be found possible, and I am, of course, in constant correspondence with them. The House will, I am sure, realise that each Dominion is differently circumstanced in this matter, and that it may not be easy to arrange for all the Dominion Prime Ministers to visit this country at the same time.
1941-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-11;Dominion Prime Ministers (Co-Operation);20;I think matters had better be treated generally in relation to all the Dominions. But I have noticed various statements.
1941-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-11;Dominion Prime Ministers (Co-Operation);126;That is a very large question, and I am not prepared to deal with it now. I think it would be very desirable to have an Imperial Conference to see what could be arranged, but it is not easy to have an Imperial Conference. We must remember that these Dominion Prime Ministers are persons of the highest consequence in their own countries, that they have the highest affairs to settle and legislatures to wait upon constantly. It is not easy for them to find the opportunity, much as they would wish to do so; but if we can get them here in the course of the summer or the autumn these matters can be discussed. Meanwhile, they are not much helped by questions of this sort.
1941-6-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-11;Dominion Prime Ministers (Co-Operation);11;No, Sir; I have seen no official request of that kind.

1945-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1945-3-07;Air Ministry (Administration);143;This brief discussion on the Adjournment is certainly not a time to go into merits, and although both the speakers who have addressed the House have recited certain charges that have been made, there has been no attempt to go into merits, and I certainly do not propose to do so. The Noble Lord has not attempted to go into merits. In fact I gather that his position is that he takes no responsibility for the charges. They may be true, they may be false, they may be exaggerated; but however it may be, he raises only the issue of principle, of Parliamentary usage and custom. As that is an important issue, I feel it my duty to deal with it myself, because although I am not the Father of the House I have been here a good deal longer than the Father.
1945-3-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1945-3-07;Air Ministry (Administration);5;But that is the proposition.

If we are challenged, if we advise against a Select Committee and we are challenged, the reason is because our solemn statement, given in all honesty and good faith, is challenged and doubted by the House. I am not blaming the Noble Lord; I should not hesitate to express my view contrary to the Government if I were free to do so, but to pretend that there have been deployed any sufficient grounds or any sufficient evidence or to pretend that there is at the present time any great body of Parliamentary opinion in favour of a Select Committee is, in my view, quite incorrect.

Here was a case of absolutely no reciprocity. A question was asked about it, and the Government are making the necessary representations.

1947-1-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-22;Special Dietetic Allowances (Medical Advice);41;Yes, but might not the process be conducted in reverse, namely, that if a medical man, a doctor attending a patient, certifies that the matter is urgent, the diet should be given, within the approved limits, pending reconsideration by higher authority?
1947-1-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-22;Special Dietetic Allowances (Medical Advice);47;The right hon. Gentleman has not really dealt with the point. The point is that a doctor attending a patient should have the responsibility of saying that special patients shall be allowed to have the extra rations until the matter is dealt with by the higher authority.
1937-6-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-6-17;India (Questions To Ministers);338;asked the Prime Minister whether he is in a position to define more exactly for the guidance of the House the limits within which he is prepared to answer questions relating to events in India; for instance, will information be given to Parliament in respect of any matter concerning which the Governors or the Governor-General are responsible to Parliament, either acting in respect of their statutory duty or in their individual judgment within the ambit of the India Constitution Act; whether in these respects information will be given as asked about facts and events in India in order that the House may judge the situation, and whether the special responsibilities of Governors are rightly exercised or not exercised; whether, for instance, any summoning of Indian Provincial Legislatures or any refusal to summon them is justified; secondly, whether information will be given on facts and events which lead or are likely to lead to the use of British or Indian troops, or concerning the protection of minorities, or to loss of life either to the troops or the civil population; further, whether provincial autonomy is deemed to be in operation for the restriction of Parliamentary questions in provinces where no Ministry has been formed which possesses the confidence of the Legislature; and whether provincial autonomy will still be deemed to be in operation notwithstanding executive power being resumed in any province by the Governor in accordance with the statute; lastly, in view of the ultimate responsibility of Parliament, as provided for in Section 93 of the Government of India Act, for the issue of any proclamation by a Governor of a province assuming to himself emergency powers in the  case of a failure of the constitutional machinery of a province, and of the further responsibility of Parliament, as provided for by the said section of the Act, for the continuance of such emergency powers, whether he can assure the House that it shall be able to obtain regularly whatever information it may require for the discharge of its duty?
1937-6-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1937-6-17;India (Questions To Ministers);34;On a point of Order. Is not the question directed not so much to the right of hon. Members to ask questions, but to the practice which Ministers propose to follow in answering them?
1937-6-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Chamberlain).txt;1937-6-17;India (Questions To Ministers);26;As the answer is long and detailed, I will, with the permission of Mr. Speaker and the House, make a statement at the end of Questions.
1937-6-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1937-6-17;India (Questions To Ministers);193;I must apologise to the House if my answer exceeds the length ordinarily regarded as appropriate for an oral answer, but my right hon. Friend's question does not lend itself very readily to a brief reply. Let me make two points clear at the outset. The first is that I do not regard the Government of India Act, 1935, as having produced, until Part II of the Act relating to Federation is brought into force, any such change in the relationship between the Central Government of India and Parliament as to justify or necessitate any change in practice and policy in regard to question and answer in this House relating to the operations of that Government. The Governor-General of India in Council still remains, so long as Part XIII of the Act is in operation, responsible through the Secretary of State for India to Parliament here. There is, of course, a well-known and well-established  convention in relation to the fiscal policy of the Indian Government, but, apart from that, the Central Government remains legally subject in respect of all its operations to the direction and control of His Majesty's Government in this country.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);169;My right hon. and gallant Friend the present Minister of State will be appointed Minister of Production. The Minister of Production is the Minister charged with chief responsibility—I may here interpolate the fact that, in the White Paper, publication of which was withdrawn, the expression "prime responsibility" is used. "Prime" in the dictionary is capable of meaning either "chief" or "primary." It is in the sense of "chief" rather than "primary" that the word is used. The word "primary" might conflict with the departmental responsibility of the Prime Minister.—He is charged, as I say, with chief responsibility on behalf of the War Cabinet, for the business of war production as a whole, subject, of course, to the policy of the Minister of Defence and of the War Cabinet itself. Subject to the position of the Admiralty, which I will mention later, he will have full effective powers to concert and supervise the activities of the Production Departments, including the adjustment of existing programmes and the initiation of future policy.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);17;I think that is clear in my statement, and it can be further elucidated in the Debate.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);10;That would be a very good topic for the Debate.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);29;Yes, Sir. I hope that the indisposition of the Minister of Production will be only temporary and brief and that he will be fit to take the Debate shortly.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);29;Yes, Sir. The Minister will have a thoroughly effective secretariat, and he will, of course, have assistance from all the technical staffs in the Departments under his general supervision.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);51;I do not think it is necessary to go into these domestic details. As a matter of fact, we prefer to stand on a general statement of policy, and we should not run the risk of publishing a White Paper and of appearing to settle everything in too legalistic a manner.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);42;No, Sir, on the contrary, and if the hon. Gentleman will read the statement, he will see that that is not the case. That is a matter which must be considered by the Minister of Production. It is possible there might be.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);2;Yes, Sir.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);26;Lord Beaverbrook will, I understand, undertake those duties, and should any change take place in what was announced, I shall take occasion to have Parliament informed.
1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);14;I said that he will determine the scope and extent of the building programme.

1942-3-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-3-12;Minister Of Production (Duties);38;I am not quite sure. That is truthful, and I am not accustomed to be told—indeed, I think any Member of this House is entitled to be protected from being told—that the answers he gives are not truthful.

1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;35;All this is being borne in mind, but the time has not come when any official declaration can be made of war aims beyond the very carefully considered general statements which have already been published.
1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;82;I do not think anyone has the opinion that we are fighting this war merely to maintain the status quo. We are, among other things, fighting it in order to survive, and when our capacity to do that is more generally recognised throughout the world, when the conviction that we have about it here becomes more general, then we shall be in a good position to take a further view of what we shall do with the victory when it is won.
1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;43;I think there is great danger in making statements which are not of a very general character upon this subject. Take, for instance, the attitude which we adopt towards the enemy when he is defeated—you will find very different opinions prevailing about that.
1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;23;Certainly I bear it in mind, and, having borne it in mind, I have ventured to give the answer which I have given.
1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;14;I think world opinion, as far as it is free, is thoroughly behind us.
1940-10-15-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-10-15;War Aims;36;I have seen the announcement from the Ministry of Information, and I have no doubt that very interesting discussions will take place, but that is quite a different thing from a statement by His Majesty's Government.
1941-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-11-11;Montenegro (Italian Atrocities);72;While I have no information of any particularly brutal Italian atrocities in Montenegro—I mean nothing out of the ordinary compared with their usual behaviour—I have recently made it clear that retribution for crimes of such a nature must henceforward take its place amongst the major purposes of the war. As regards the bombing of Rome, I have nothing to add to the statement in my speech in this House on 30th September.
1941-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-11-11;Montenegro (Italian Atrocities);24;I do not see what the last part has to do with the Question on the Paper, which is fully covered by my Answer.
1941-11-11-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-11-11;Montenegro (Italian Atrocities);30;I think it would be as well to have confidence in the decision of the Government, whose sole desire is to inflict the maximum amount of injury on the enemy.
1955-2-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1955-2-23;Nato Countries (Nuclear Weapons);85;A country such as ours with world-wide commitments could not accept control by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation over non-N.A.T.O. activities. We could not therefore propose that other countries should submit to such restrictions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation can therefore only impose restrictions on the actions of member Governments when they are acting as members of that Organisation. I may add that it is public knowledge that American Air forces based in Britain will only be used with the consent of Her Majesty's Government.
1955-2-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1955-2-23;Nato Countries (Nuclear Weapons);17;Sir, we have a great deal of influence and widespread responsibilities, but we are not yet all-powerful.
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);94;It is hardly a question of admission on my part. This was a set of decisions, with which I do not in principle disagree, left us by our predecessors. I may say that I have heard it reported that the re-armament programme of £4,700 million agreed to by the late Government would now probably cost something in the neighbour-hood of £5,200 million owing to the ever-increasing lack of purchasing power of the £ sterling, and that is a factor to be taken into consideration. We shall do our best to meet all these difficulties.
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);13;There does not seem to be any difference between us on this point.
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);43;We are pushing ahead to the best of our ability, but it is not possible to say exactly what delays  will be involved. Undoubtedly, there is a certain lag, and we shall do our very utmost to limit that as much as possible.
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);48;I think the hon. Gentleman would do well, if I might make a suggestion, to discuss this matter with the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan), who was, I believe, responsible at the time when the proposal to spend £4,700 million in three years was proposed.
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);33;I think that is entirely irrelevant to the Question that is now asked me, but I will certainly devote my attention to it if the right hon. Gentleman will put down a Question.
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);5;We are all deeply interested—
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);23;Mr. Speaker, may I have a ruling from you as to which of the two right hon. competitors I am to reply to?
1952-2-05-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-2-05;Re-Armament Programme (Progress);50;To the right hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) I say that I can quite understand his conscientious anxieties about the course he took. I am sure he will receive the most charitable consideration from the House in any exposition which the Rules of Order permit him to make.

Those not granted deferment will of course retain their individual rights under the National Service Act concerning conscientious objection, postponement of calling-up on account of exceptional hardship, and other mitigations.

1941-12-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-12-02;Maximum National Effort;183;I am coming to the point which the Noble Lady has uppermost in her mind—the subject of women. In order to put as many minds at rest as possible, let me begin by saying two things. First, we do not propose at the present time to extend compulsion to join the Services to any married women, not even childless married women. They may of course volunteer, but they will not be compelled. Secondly, as regards married women and industry, we have already the power, and my right hon. Friend has already been given the power and has been frequently reminded of it, to direct married women into industry. This power will continue to be used with discretion. The wife of a man serving in  the Forces or Merchant Navy will not be called upon to work away from her home area; nor will women with household responsibilities be moved from their home area. But there are some married women without children or other household responsibilities whom we may have to call upon to go to another area where their industrial services are needed.

1951-6-20-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1951-6-20;Hm Submarine "Affray" (Loss);28;I am not so sure. Would it not be a great feather in the cap of the Admiralty if they achieved the great process of salving this vessel?

May I ask the Home Secretary whether this is not a case of an Act of Parliament having been maturely considered by a subsequent Government and then put into operation by a deliberate and measured Parliamentary procedure; and, because the results are unfavourable to the interests of the Socialist Party, the whole process has to be begun over again? Is this not a case of flagrant and shameful gerrymandering?
1946-11-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-11-13;Parliamentary Boundaries (Fresh Review);160;I need scarcely say that it is no' part of my desire or intention to argue such a matter with the Chair, but I reserve my full right to argue it with Ministers of the Crown. May I not submit that it is quite true that in this, as  in every other redistribution scheme, Members of all parties are adversely affected, and that they cry out when they are adversely affected? If there are these cries from both sides, would it not be better to allow the decision of the Commission, arrived at on grounds and by procedure approved by the Government, to come into effect; and is it not vitiating the whole principle of a redistribution system if, because a number of Socialist pocket boroughs in London, including the Prime Minister's, happen to be disfranchised, the whole business of going through this procedure should be begun again? It is merely a plan of "heads I win, tails you lose."
1946-11-13-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-11-13;Parliamentary Boundaries (Fresh Review);90;On the matter of redistribution, there has always been certain contact between both sides of the House —it certainly was so in 1885, which is an example I can quote—and the Measure to which this proposal relates was the product of Coalition Government consultation. May I ask why, at a time when the Government, unknown to us, have consulted Mr. Speaker upon these matters, no communication was made to this side of the House about a matter, on which, hitherto, we had all been united? Why was not that done?

I need not say that nothing that has come from me, or from any of my Friends on this side of the House, reflects in the slightest degree on your impartiality, or on the impartiality  of the Commission. I must submit to you as a matter of Order, that the point we were pressing was not that the Commission had not proceeded impartially and properly and without political interference upon the lines and the basis assigned to them, but that, because the results were unsatisfactory to the majority in this House and to the Government, therefore the work had to be begun over again.

1939-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-3-16;Navy Estimates, 1939;187;It was a great opportunity for the Fnancial Secretary, both last year and this year, to have to make the general statement on behalf of the Admiralty and to present the Estimates to the House. I believe that every one feels that he has seized this opportunity with a long arm and a firm hand, and has put it to the best possible use. I should like to associate myself with the tribute which he paid to Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson. Those of us who know that officer—and I knew him when he was gunnery lieutenant doing the gunnery trials of the ships when we were building before the Great War—will realise the rare and remarkable qualities which he brought to the service of the Royal Navy. He has expended his energy, his life, his thought, his mental energy, an attribute which is rare nowadays, in the most generous manner, and if he has been stricken down by an affliction, which we all hope is only temporary, he is in exactly the same position as a brave officer who is wounded fighting for his country in action.
1939-3-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1939-3-16;Navy Estimates, 1939;288;It is well known that at the most critical period of the War this officer, then in a subordinate station, taking his career in his hands, presented facts and figures and arguments which eventually reached the highest authority—the Prime Minister—and that through that report a great change was made in our naval disposition, without which it could not be said with certainty that the submarine menace at that time would have been overcome. I naturally can touch upon only very few points in the extremely important and weightily considered statement to which we have  listened. The first is a very small point, but as I am dealing with the Financial Secretary to the Admiralty I would say that it has particular relevance to his office. The expense of the Navy is rising this year by £23,000,000, and yet the Estimate is presented in a form which states, in a most decisive manner, a net decrease of £26,000,000. This is due, as footnotes explain, to the fact that £84,000,000 is provided by Loan or Appropriations-in-Aid in 1939 instead of £34,000,000 from that source in 1938. It would hardly be possible to make a financial statement in amore misleading, and I must say, or more silly fashion. After all, the fact that this House is providing £153,000,000 for service of the Navy in this critical year, is a factor which may play an important part in maintaining stability. Why then state it in the worst way? I happen to know that many people, some of whom ought to know better, have been misled by the form in which these figures are presented, and by the statement that there is a net decrease in the expense of the Navy of £26,000,000.

The House would hardly gather from the euphemistic phrase the Parliamentary Secretary employed—"replacement"—that these two ships are to be destroyed. That does not tell us what one would expect, that until the new ships are in commission the old ones will be kept in reserve. In other days I used to say that when the ace is out the king is the best card. These old ships can play their part, although we must be careful not to bring them into contact with new ships in the event of war.

It had always been kept open, as I think he will agree, that we should have the right to put in a counter claim for the immense services which we rendered in saving those 400 million people from being ravaged, pillaged and slaughtered as they would otherwise, to a large extent, have been. In what has been concluded now have we kept open until 1951 the full freedom of reviewing this question—the main question of what is called "sterling balances," which is a euphemism for British debts? Is that position open and can it be raised and examined de novo in the year 1951?

This organisation, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, supported by their professional advisers, gives to the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the necessary control over not only the military but the civil sphere, subject, of course, to the fact that he has direct access to the Prime Minister or Minister of Defence for the time being, and can thus receive such guidance upon questions of high policy as may from time to time be required. It would be the greatest mistake, at the moment when it may well have to be put to the proof, to liquidate and remould this organisation, which at the present time is working to the satisfaction of all the principal executive persons concerned. It must, of course, be continually tested and improved. I cannot conceive that the proposal pressed in some quarters to appoint a super Commander-in-Chief over the whole field of the three Services and the civil power would not be a serious impediment to effective action; and I have never yet heard any practical suggestion as to who that officer should be.

We have a good deal of business to do before Easter, but I will give an opportunity for the matter to be raised. I hope that if it is raised, it will be debated, not on the Adjournment, but on a Motion moved either by the Government, or by someone opposed to the action of the Government; and I hope that the matter will be pressed to a Division, in order to let us clearly see what is the balance of opinion on the matter.

Great differences arose in their methods of calculation. Hours were wasted in the Committees because they were arguing at cross-purposes, the same words and figures not meaning the same things. So then we established—I was largely guided by Lord Cherwell in this—a uniform system which exists today, by which the basic statistics are presented by each Department upon a common foundation.

Should the House agree to the deletion of the Clause, the Government propose to move to reinstate the original Clause, without the Amendment, on the Report stage, and to treat its passage throughout as a matter of confidence.

It is really impossible to distinguish between votes on domestic policy and votes on the general policy of the war, in this country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] His Majesty's Government are entirely in the hands of the House, which has the fullest authority of any legislative assembly in the world, and we trust it will use it with responsibility.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Government Defeat);86;I was making a statement on the Business of the House, and I think it would be very wrong for the Government to be the first of all Governments to be deprived of the facility of making statements. However, after my statement is finished, the Adjournment of the House will be moved, and if it is thought that a discussion on that Adjournment is likely to lessen the tension which prevails, there will be nothing in the attitude of the Government to prevent it taking place.
1944-3-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-3-29;Education Bill (Government Defeat);115;As an old Member of the House, I should have thought that it was, obviously, an issue which required the widest latitude that the Chair felt inclined to give, when the Chair would be supported, as it certainly would be, by the general sense of the Committee. With regard to the question asked of me by my right hon. Friend opposite, I entirely share his views that it would be a great pity to have what he called a ragged and stormy Debate to-day. But that is not a matter for us to settle. We have to wipe out the Business to-day and that can only be done by moving the Adjournment of the House.

As to the course which individual Members take on every Amendment, on every question, they must consult their consciences and their duty.

I was in this House on the previous occasions to which reference has been made, and I can well remember the incidents of 1922 and 1924.

1950-3-21-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1950-3-21;Motion For New Writ (Objection);43;I might ask the right hon. Gentleman what is the unusual reason for delay.

At the present time the conversations are on a staff level, but it may well be that agreement will be reached. On the other hand, agreement may not be reached.

1952-5-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-14;Mediterranean (Nato Command);36;Yes.

I think it would be a great help to many of us in judging these matters to have it clearly established that Parliamentary action had been taken against the conduct of particular Members, irrespective of the well-known Privilege of the House, and irrespective of the judgment of a court of law.
1947-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-30;Cases Of Mr Allig Han And Mr Walkden;49;Again, I do not desire to do anything but help the discussion of this topic, but the right hon.

1947-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-30;Cases Of Mr Allig Han And Mr Walkden;88;But they are not covered by the argument which the right hon. Gentleman is unfolding. The right hon. Gentleman spoke about the habit of addressing Members invariably as "the hon. Member for this" and "the hon. Member for that," but if the House decides that "dishonourable" is the word to be applied, it seems to me to be fatal to the Member concerned. I only want to show the right hon. Gentleman the path along which he is advancing, in case he should go further than he intends.

Apparently, at these meetings there was a person present who was not a Member of Parliament at all—the editor of the official paper of the party opposite. Is that not so?
1947-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-30;Cases Of Mr Allig Han And Mr Walkden;124;The right hon. Gentleman says it has nothing to do with this. Let us know what the facts are. If that were so, how can it be argued that this journalist and editor, being present, had not a great advantage which he could use in conducting the whole policy of his newspaper and that he was getting, by the full assent of the Government party, the facilities which other papers were trying to pick up through this course and through that? I think it is most important to know what is the position of a journalist who is invited by the convenors of a party meeting to be present on occasions of this kind. That is what the right hon. Gentleman does not like.
1947-10-30-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-30;Cases Of Mr Allig Han And Mr Walkden;15;No; too sweeping and too much associated with a particular procedure of the party meeting.

I am sure that Her Majesty's  Government will always do their best, subject to the demands of public business, to afford opportunities to debate these large issues. I suggest that there are opportunities open to the Opposition on Supply days, and there are other opportunities which readily occur to me but, in any case, we have no desire to prevent these matters from being discussed. On the contrary. Might they not be the subject of discussion through the usual channels to find an opportunity? The House should always be helped to talk about the things it wants to discuss, but there must be reasonable opportunity. Why not let it be discussed in the ordinary manner?

1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);91;The value of the speech which has just ended was, I thought, that it showed how extremely complex these Greek politics are. The hon. Gentleman made a very large number of assertions, some of which  were accurate, some of which were, according to my information, rather the reverse. At any rate, hours of debate, day after day, would be required if this House were to attempt to emulate the mastery of the details of the position in Greece, which he has been able to acquire in spite of other serious preoccupations.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);88;I beg pardon. There is always the stock answer that  man embraces woman, unless the contrary appears in the context. But this man, or woman, should do this without fear, and without any form of intimidation or victimisation. He marks his ballot paper in, strict secrecy, and then elected representatives meet and together decide what government, or even, in times of stress, what form of government they wish to have in their country. If that is democracy I salute it. I espouse it. I would work for it.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);85;I am not at all afraid to go into that discussion, but I have a good deal of ground to cover. It is one of those gross misrepresentations in which a certain class of people indulge that I have spoken praising words about Franco. All I said was that Spanish politics did not merely consist in drawing rude cartoons about it. It is really no use for my hon. Friend to screw his face up as if he were taking a nasty dose of medicine.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);142;I do not know about many other people in the country, because everybody can have their opinion about that. But so far as the hon. Gentleman is concerned I expect there are some other nasty gulps to swallow in the course of what, with great respect, I shall endeavour to lay before them. I must say that I do not wish to be drawn into a discussion of Spain this morning. In the remarks I make about democracy and the attitude I have taken throughout the time I have been burdened with these high responsibilities, and broadly I believe throughout my life, in the remarks I have made, and in the statements representing the policy of His Majesty's present Government, we stand upon the foundation of free elections based on universal suffrage, and that is what we consider the foundation for democracy.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);149;I am sorry to be causing so much distress. [Interruption.] I have plenty of time, and if any out-cries are wrung from hon. Members opposite I can always take a little longer in what I have to say, though I should regret to do so. I say that the last thing that represents democracy is mob law and the attempt to introduce a totalitarian régime and clamours to shoot everyone—there are lots of opportunities at the present time—who is politically inconvenient as part of a purge of those who are said to have—and very often have not—sought to collaborate with the Germans during the occupation. Do not let us rate democracy so low, do not let us rate democracy as if it were merely grabbing power and shooting those who do not agree with you. That is the antithesis of democracy; this is not what democracy is based on.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);229;The hon. Member should not get so excited because he is going to have much the worse of the argument and much the worse of the Division. I was eleven years a fairly solitary figure in this House and pursued my way in patience, and so there may be hope for the hon. Member. Democracy, I say, is not based on violence or terrorism, but on reason, on fair play, on freedom, on respecting other people's rights as well as their ambitions. Democracy is no harlot to be picked up in the street by a man with a tommy gun. I trust the people, the mass of  the people, in almost any country, but I like to make sure that it is the people and not a gang of bandits from the mountains or from the countryside who think that by violence they can overturn constituted authority, in some cases ancient Parliaments, Governments and States. That is my general description of the foundation upon which we should approach the various special instances on which I am going to dwell. During the war, of course, we have had to arm anyone who could shoot a Hun. Apart from their character, political convictions, past records and so forth, if they were out to shoot a Hun we accepted them as friends and tried to enable them to fulfil their healthy instincts.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);305;We are paying for it in having this Debate to-day, which personally I have found rather enjoyable, so far. We are paying for it also with our treasure and our blood. We are not paying for it with our honour or by defeat But when countries are liberated it does not follow that those who have received our weapons should use them in order to engross to themselves by violence and murder and bloodshed all those powers and traditions and continuity which many countries have slowly developed and to which quite a large proportion of their people, I believe the great majority, are firmly attached. If what is called in this Amendment the action of "the friends of democracy" is to be interpreted as carefully planned coups d' état by murder gangs and by the iron rule of ruffians seeking to climb into the seats of power, without a vote ever having been cast in their favour—if that is to masquerade as democracy I think the House will unite in condemning it as a mockery. I do not admit—I am keeping to the words of the Amendment—that those popular elements who so "valorously"—in some cases I must say—assisted the defeat of the enemy have the right to come forward and say, "We are the saviours of the nation; we must therefore henceforward be its rulers, its masters; that is our reward; we must now claim to sit in judgment over all"—that is, the vast mass of people in every occupied country who have had to live out their lives as well as they could under the iron rule and oppression of  the Germans. These valorous elements are now to rule with dictatorial power gained by a coup d'état, by bloody street fighting and slaughter, and are to judge the high, the middle and the poor.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);185;So far I am generalising on the principles of what democracy should be and also some of the principles which it should not follow. War criminals, the betrayers of their countrymen, the men who sincerely wished that Germany might win—these may be the objects of popular disgust or boycott, and may in extreme cases be brought before the courts of law and punished with death, but I hope those will be courts of law, where fair trial may be had, and not mere expressions of mob juries or political rivals. But to those who try to establish the point that the men who went out into the hills and were given rifles or machine guns by the British Government have by fee simple acquired the right to govern vast complex communities such as Belgium or Holland—it may be Holland next—or Greece, I say I repulse that claim. They have done good service and it is for the State, and not for them, to judge of the regards they should receive. It is not for them to claim ownership of the State, which cannot be admitted.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);163;That is what is being fought out now. However long I laboured I could not hope to convert individual gentlemen opposite to the better course, but I am addressing my remarks not only to them but to other Members in the House, of whom there are quite a large number. I say we march along an onerous and painful path. Poor old England! Perhaps I ought to say "Poor old Britain." We have to assume the burden of most thankless tasks and in undertaking them to be scoffed at, criticised and opposed from every quarter; but at least we know where we are making for, know the end of the road, know what is our objective. It is that these countries shall be freed from the German armed power and under conditions of normal tranquillity shall have  a free universal vote to decide the Government of their country—except a Fascist régime—and whether that Government shall be of the Left or of the Right.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);120;Might I be permitted to continue this argument? [Interruption.] I will give the hon. Gentleman the opportunity when I have finished the particular phase of the argument that I am dealing with. I do not want to deny any courtesy—although it would be abusing that courtesy if the hon. Gentleman turned a question into a speech. After  all, we British, who are now suggested to be poor friends of democracy, lost 35,000 to 40,000 men in opening up the great port of Antwerp, and our Navy has cleared the Scheldt river. The sacrifice of these men has always to be considered, as well as the friends of democracy advancing in lorries—in lorries—from Mons, to start a bloody revolution in Brussels.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);17;I should think it was hardly possible to state the opposite of the truth with more precision.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);234;I back up those who seek to establish democracy and civilisation.—[Interruption.] The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) must learn to take as well as to give. There is no one more free with interruptions, taunts, and jibes than he is. I saw him—I heard him, not saw him—almost assailing some of the venerable figures on the bench immediately below him. He need not get so angry because the House laughs at him; he ought to be pleased when they only laugh at him. As I said, I back up all those who seek to establish democracy and civilisation on a basis of law, and also popular, untramelled, unintimidated, free, universal suffrage voting. It would be pretty hard on Europe if, after four or five years of German tyranny, she was liquidated and degenerated and plunged into a series of brutal social wars. If the friends of democracy and its various defenders believe that they express the wishes of the majority, why cannot they wait for the General Election; why cannot they await the free vote of the people—which is our sole policy in every country into which British and American Armies are advancing? There is the story of Belgium, which I submit, with the utmost respect and affection, to the American people, as well as to the House of  Commons, carries many lessons which are applicable to other parts of the world.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);138;How little helpful it is to the progress of our Debate to fling in other large questions. I am not speaking about France to-day. I certainly never felt about de Gaulle the sentiments which experience has engendered in me about Count Sforza. De Gaulle is a man of honour, and has never broken his word. That is what I am coming to, because these things have to come out. I say that we should have to put a great deal of responsibility on those who called him to power. We are not avid of becoming deeply involved in the politics of the conquered or liberated countries. All we require from them is a Government which will guarantee us the necessary protection, and facilities for the lines of communication,  from Naples to Ravenna, lately taken, and to the North.

Gentleman, no doubt, has quoted many things I have said, as he has a right to do. As I say, our interest in Italy is in the front where we have Armies engaged under General Alexander and General Mark Clark, that daring and skilful American General under whom we have confidently placed an Army which is at least three-quarters British or British-controlled.

1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);231;But we had the right to express a point of view on the Greek question, because in an attempt to redeem our pledged word, we have sustained 30,000 casualties, in what may, perhaps, be called a chivalrous resolve to share the miseries of Greece when she was invaded by Italy and Germany in 1941. At this time we were all alone ourselves in the world. My honoured friend, the President, was of opinion that we should certainly have plans made and accordingly, at the Quebec Conference, it was proposed by the combined Chiefs of Staff that the British should prepare a Force to occupy the Athens area and so pave the way for the commencement of relief and for the establishment of law and order and for the instalment of the Greek Government, which we and the great bulk of the United Nations had formally recognised. The Americans and ourselves began to accumulate large masses of food and shipping, and established U.N.R.R.A. U.N.R.R.A. began to grow up in Alexandria and other organisations for food distribution were actively engaged, and we gathered our much strained shipping vessels together at the cost of food to this country. A large part of these stores and medical relief were provided by America out of her riches. The rest of the burden fell upon us, and, of course, the diminution of shipping falls heavily upon us.
1944-12-08-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-12-08;Liberated Europe (British Intervention);240;The British troops were welcomed enthusiastically as they entered Athens and so also was the Greek Brigade, which had mutinied earlier in the year but was freed from the mutinous element. I took great trouble about this Brigade to give it a chance to redeem its reputation. It not only redeemed its reputation but won renown for the Greek Army by entering Rimini at the head of the Allied Forces. By wresting Rimini from the Germans, this Brigade now came back to Athens, having heaped coals of fire upon the Italian heads who had invited the Germans to ruin Greece. But now the Greeks helped the Italians to drive the Germans from Italy itself, and this Brigade was received with a great welcome in the streets of Athens. By this time M. Papandreou had gathered no less than six E.A.M. representatives into his Government, and the leader of the Liberal Party, Mr. Sophoulis, a veteran and venerable counsellor of 84 or 85 years of age.—[An HON. MEMBER: "You are getting on."]—Oh yes, I am getting on; we are all getting on. Mr. Sophoulis was already complaining that too many E.A.M. and Communist representatives were already installed in places of power. M. Papandreou, however, is a man of the Left, a democrat, a Socialist, not a Liberal or anything like that, in fact almost everything that is supposed to be correct nowadays, M. Papandreou put his trust in those six gentlemen.

Meanwhile, the forces of E.L.A.S., which is the military instrument of E.A.M., were planning a descent on Athens as a military and political operation and the seizure of power by armed force. E.L.A.S. is a mixed body and it would be unfair to stigmatise them all as being entirely self-seeking in their aims and actions. Nevertheless, during the years of Greek captivity I must say that E.L.A.S. devoted far more attention to beating up and destroying the representatives of the E.D.E.S., commanded by Colonel Zervas, a man of the Left by our standards.

He was a man who was correct according to the current jargon. The wrong element of the E.A.M. devoted themselves more to attacking Zervas and his followers on the West side of Greece than they did to attacking the Germans themselves. For the past two years E.L.A.S. have devoted themselves principally to preparations for seizing power. We may, some of us, have underrated the extremes to which those preparations have been carried or the many privations and cruelties which have been inflicted on the village populations in the areas over which they prevail. [An HON. MEMBER: "What is the evidence?"] I have taken every pains to collect information and everything I say on fact in these matters has been most carefully examined beforehand by the officials who are thoroughly acquainted with the details.

[Interruption.] Of course, in this House we are Conservatives, Labour, Liberal and so forth; we are not E.L.A.S. and E.D.E.S. as some gentlemen seem to imagine.

Gentleman who, I am sure, has been treated with extraordinary and great consideration in this House in these times, should learn to keep his mouth shut. E.L.A.S. did not hesitate on occasion to help the Germans to catch and kill the supporters of E.D.E.S. The German rule in Greece was feeble and took the form mainly of hideous reprisals upon the unhappy countryside and it was from this that by a kind of tacit agreement the Security Battalions, some of which were a kind of local Home Guard of the villages against predatory E.L.A.S. bands, came into being. Others were formed and acted in a manner contrary to the interests of the country. From the depredations and ravages of E.L.A.S. there was, however, as we can now see, a fairly well organised plot or plan by which E.L.A.S. should march down upon  Athens and seize it by armed force and establish a reign of terror under the plea that they were purging collaborationists.

At length, in February, 1947, the right hon. Gentleman announced that he had decided to refer the matter to the United Nations. But having done so, what happened? A United Nations Committee was set up to examine the matter. It recommended the termination of the Mandate, and, by a majority vote, it recommended the policy of the partition of Palestine.

Gentlemen do not like the argument I have to unfold. They must not shrink from bearing these strokes. We bear with what fortitude we can summon the heavy blows struck us by the Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister  and others, and similar equanimity and toleration should prevail in the ranks of our opponents. His Majesty's Government, in the whole of this matter, have always been one, or even two, and sometimes three, steps behind the march of events. When the State of Israel was proclaimed, it was recognised at once by the Americans. His Majesty's Government could at least have accepted the principle of partition laid down in the United Nations Resolution. When they finally accepted that principle in the Bernadotte Report of September last, why could they not have faced reality and accorded de facto recognition to Israel?

I am sure that we could have agreed immediately after the war upon a partition scheme which would have been more favourable to the Arabs than that which will now follow their unsuccessful recourse to arms.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;81;I give my opinion. I am sure we could have made better arrangements for the Arabs at that time—I am not talking of the Jews—than will be possible after there has been this unfortunate recourse to arms. Indeed, the scheme of partition proposed by U.N.O. was better than what they will get now, after their defeat. We are  evidently in the presence here of prolonged, repeated and serious miscalculations on the part of the Foreign Secretary and his advisers and colleagues.

What the right hon. Gentleman has been telling us now might have been said a good many months ago, and I am going to look back a little bit before I look at the present. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for West Bristol (Mr. Stanley) said, very wisely, perhaps, that the worst thing was to do nothing at all. I must remind the right hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) that this matter was considered in the Government which he led and of which I was a  member, whether action could be taken. He said himself he could have taken action, but he did not take it.

That would have been the stick used to beat us.
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;167;The right hon. Member for Woodford seemed to me to make a number of contradictory statements, and he had very scant regard for the facts. I rather wondered just why he was taking this action. I think that it seemed to him that it might be useful to make an attack on my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary. It has been suggested that the policy followed in Palestine or anywhere else in foreign affairs is the personal, individual policy of the Foreign Secretary. That is entirely untrue. Foreign policy is naturally discussed by the Government, the Government take decisions and the Government stand by the Minister who has to carry out those decisions. The second thing was that a suggestion has been made—I am not sure that the right hon. Member for Woodford did not make it—that my right hon. Friend was actuated by a dislike of the Jews. That is entirely and utterly untrue. My right hon. Friend has many good friends among the Jews—
1949-1-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-1-26;Middle East;92;—and I imagine that the same applies to hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite. My right hon. Friend has been thanked very often for his services to the cause of the Jews. He has been thanked for his work by Jewish labour for helping them in forming their federation and getting them into the  International Labour Office. Indeed, I have seen a paper circulated in which my right hon. Friend is put down with many other eminent people as one of the architects of Zionism. Yet there is this vendetta against him.

Gentleman to the fact that three months have passed since the General Election and that a  constituency with 80,000 voters has been disfranchised during the whole of that period? How do the Government propose to abridge this period of delay? Are they not now presented with a unanimous Report by the Select Committee advising legislation to remove the evil? Are they not also in possession of the legal opinion of the Attorney-General, supported by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Derby (Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe) and other high legal authorities, that there is no case which would sustain a common informer? Are we to continue to keep 80,000 electors without any right to take part in this Parliament?

I had hoped to receive from the right hon. Gentleman today an assurance that the Government would legislate as rapidly as possible in the sense of the unanimous Report of the Committee. As that has not been forthcoming I wish to give notice that in my opinion, supported by a great mass of legal authority, it is the duty of the hon. Member to take the oath and take his seat at the earliest possible opportunity. That is the advice which I propose to tender to him. Does the right hon. Gentleman realise how much the procedure of Select Committees, which we imagined could deal with the matter promptly, has been, as it were,  clouded by the long delay and by all these devices of having it referred to the Privy Council and so on which, happily, the good sense of the Committee repudiated?

1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;187;We shall, of course, give the fullest possible details. With regard to the first point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, we have to consider the position, as I stated, of the British communities and representatives in this disturbed area. Over a long period there has been civil war. It was decided that it was wise to keep a vessel at Nanking. It is therefore a matter for decision by those on the spot as to when relief should take place. If it is put off all the time, because of a possible danger—and it is very difficult when there are irregular forces on one side—we should never get that relief, and so I think a decision had to be come to. The right hon. Gentleman would notice that there was talk of an armistice, and the armistice expired but hostilities were not  opened. A period of waiting then ensued to consider the position. Then, when there was an ultimatum, it was decided to relieve this ship in time before the ultimatum expired. In our view, the commanding officer there on the spot exercised a right judgment.

Gentleman could not have followed what I said, because it was pointed out that the voyage would have been completed 24 hours before zero hour. That is the reply to that. With regard to the allocation of ships and the rest, I do not think I could make any further statement on that. It is a matter we could well debate.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;190;Now that we have received this statement from the Government as to the facts, might we have an indication of what their reaction is upon them? We have suffered very serious injury and our prestige has been affected, except in regard to the valour of our men, and is this to be the end? What course do His Majesty's Government intend to pursue? I am not asking for a statement on this today, but it is obvious that a matter like this cannot be allowed to go away in default with a mere statement of the facts from the Prime Minister and with a passive acceptance of them by the House of Commons. Something more than that must be done. I am not pressing for an immediate statement, especially as one cannot say beforehand what it is necessary and right to do, but I should like to have an assurance from the Government that they will face this matter in a robust spirit and will make sure that the British flag is respected and that British lives are not flung away without Parliament pursuing the matter with vigour and attention.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;52;The right hon.

The situation is still fluid, but certainly we shall make a statement on the position.

1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;108;On the first point, I have not got the exact date by me, but it was a considerable time ago. The right hon. and learned Gentleman will remember that the Chinese Government moved to Canton, that various changes in the Government took place, and that they subsequently came back to Nanking. For a considerable period of weeks, indeed I think months, there has been the passage of our ships and the ships of other nations up the Yangtse. I think one would be entitled to say that it was notified on every occasion and there was no objection. As a matter of fact, this practice has been allowed.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;36;The decision was announced in the House that we did not propose to withdraw our nationals, and that decision was taken in consultation with other nationals there.

1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;82;I think I tried to point out to the House that there had been this question of additional tension over a great period—that had been going on for a very long time with rumours of imminent crossings—and, therefore, they did as a matter of fact delay the ordinary relief because of the alleged termination of an armistice. Then there came the extension of the armistice and the opportunity was taken of that extension to effect the relief. I think that was right.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;108;I did not say that this was a routine matter on the kind of lines that one could either do it or not; there had to be the supplies and there had to be the relief, and the commander on the spot had to consider what was the time to do it. I have been through the dates very often, but this was the time selected as, otherwise, he might not have been able to reach them at all. He considered—and I. think he was right in thinking that, in view of the evidence available and actions of the past—that the relief could be effected during this pause.

I have indicated them and, therefore, I do not wish to press for an adjournment of the House today, but we shall accept the offer of the Prime Minister to discuss, through the usual channels, a Debate upon this issue in the near future. Because it has many aspects, I should like to make it absolutely clear that whatever criticism we may male of what I may call the unfortunate handling of a difficult situation, which has led our people to lose their lives, that in no wise detracts from our resentment at the atrocious outrage of which we have been the victims, or from our determination to press the Government to take effective steps to make sure that we are treated with respect in the future.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;48;As I have told the right hon. Gentleman, we are perfectly willing to have a Debate. We want to take every possible step to protect the communities in China—our British community; that is one of the points we have to bear in mind in dealing with this matter.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;91;I am not prepared to state in advance any steps with regard to the movement of any forces in this area. I am quite well aware that aircraft are used in warfare, but this was not a matter of warfare at all. There was no suggestion of making an attack anywhere at all. We were engaged in the peaceful process of bringing supplies up the river and it would have been quite unusual to have provided a bomber force or anything like that in conjunction with peaceful operations of that kind.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;90;I naturally leave this matter to be one for the commanders on the spot to deal with. I am not sheltering myself and I take full responsibility, but I am now being asked to answer detailed questions about how this operation of keeping a warship at Nanking should be conducted and how those reliefs should be done. I am repeating the point that we were engaged in a peaceful occupation. The suggestion seems to be that we were staging something like an operation. We were doing nothing of the kind.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;14;I cannot make any further statement except that all possible steps are being taken.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;28;I thought it was quite clear from my statement that we were unable to contact the Communist authorities. There could be no possible question of making any apology.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;36;I have already stated—and I am sure the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Woodford will agree—that whatever steps we are taking, we cannot make a public announcement of the exact steps that we are taking.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;8;I certainly could not answer that without notice.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;31;I thought I had already made it clear to the House that we did every possible thing to contact the Communist forces and that we could not get any message through.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;26;If my hon. Friend will study my statement he will see that that was an addition I made saying "afterwards"; we had already done it before.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;45;Any decisions for action in this matter were taken by the men on the spot at the time. I have given full information to the House; I cannot give more information of what occurred than that which I have given. We simply have this information.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;29;This matter was a matter within the responsibiity of the local commander. He consulted with His Majesty's Ambassador, but there was no reference back here before action was taken.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;16;No one has yet pointed out exactly what the aircraft would have done in this matter.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;79;In any further Debate I am quite prepared to answer any questions. All I can say now is that this was a matter which was decided by the authorities on the spot. No suggestion or order was given from here that aircraft either should or should not be used. This was a matter in which, whatever operations were undertaken, were undertaken by those on the spot. In my view they took the right line in the decision they took.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;34;Are not the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Defence in close touch with the men on the spot? Ought they not to be following this situation and able to make—
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;36;What did the hon. Member say? Are those right hon. Gentlemen keeping in close touch, instead of leaving it to the men on the spot, and so being confronted with an unfortunate episode of this character?
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;33;I am quite sure the right hon. Gentleman would not think it right that day-to-day meticulous orders should be given to local commanders to carry out. No commander would wish to have them.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;96;Would it not have been right for the Admiralty authorities and the Government, when' they had information that this ship was to proceed up the river, and when the Communists had been entrenched along, or in strong occupation of, the north bank for weeks before, and when an armistice was expiring in a few hours—would it not have been right for them to have been in the closest touch with their officers on the spot, instead of throwing the whole burden on them, and expecting that they could get off behind them for all their muddle?
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;31;I am not prepared to take that from the right hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Gentleman knows quite well that there has been this difficult situation for weeks along the Yangtse.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;1;Yes.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;85;He knows that there have been rumours of crossings, and rumours of an armistice. We are keeping in touch with the situation, but a particular occasion like this is one for decision. There is no question of sheltering behind any commander on the spot. The commander on the spot took action. I approve his action. I support his action. That does not say that all the time from the Admiralty, the man on the spot, who knows the exact conditions, should be receiving detailed orders.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;7;He is in London at the moment.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;6;No, I cannot answer that now.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;4;No aircraft at Shanghai.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;2;Hong Kong.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;29;The hon. and gallant Gentleman does not quote me correctly. I said that no one on the Opposition side had suggested exactly what they could have done about it.
1949-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-4-26;Attacks On Hm Ships China;25;I cannot answer as to the exact time in detail without notice. If the hon. Gentleman will put down a Question I shall answer it.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;5;I did not say that.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;10;I used the words "chicken-hearted," but not in that context.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;78;The hon. Member is repeating a very old slander. Everybody knows that the vote against the Estimates was a vote against Government policy and not for disarmament.  If the hon. Member will look back, he will find that that attitude was taken by prominent Members of most parties. It was never intended to register a vote for disarmament. I think it is unfortunate that such a statement, which was put about for party purposes, should be repeated now.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Lord Privy Seal (Mr. Attlee).txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;1;rose—
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;291;The Government opened this Debate with a speech by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. It has run for two days, and I think that perhaps it is appropriate that a Minister of the Crown should speak at this time and answer some of the points which have been made in the Debate. We have had a very interesting discussion, and, if I may say so, a much more representative discussion than we have had for some time. There has been a tendency for debates on general subjects, in my view, to be left too much to one or two Members who are not necessarily very representative of the opinions of the House of Commons. To-day and yesterday we have had some real debate; there has been the play of debate and answer from side to side of the House. The hon. Member for Eye (Mr. Granville) ranged over a large number of topics. I thought that some of them had been dealt with rather more specifically and coherently by other Members, and I propose to deal with them in saying something of other speeches. It struck me at one point in his speech that he rather recalled the old fable of the  fly that sat on a cartwheel and said, "Gracious, what a dust I raise!" because it seemed as if everything that had happened had been due to him. I was rather surprised when he suggested that a year ago we ought to have had the kind of arrangement that we have with the United States of America now. He must realise that the kind of arrangement you can have between two Allies is different from that which you can have between a neutral State and a belligerent.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;204;I do not think that is a very valuable interruption. The hon. Member has verified the point I made. The only other distinctive point he made was one which the Prime Minister has dealt with. That was the complicated and difficult question of the working between the different parts of the British Commonwealth in regard to War Cabinet representation: The hon. Member a little tends to assume that when he puts forward a view it is the view of all the Dominions. The Dominions are separate and distinct nations, and it is a mistake to think that there is a Dominion view that ought to be heard. The Dominions are equal with us, and they have their distinctive views. It is a mistake to think that necessarily they all take the same view of what form of machinery should be set up, or, if they did, that that view was the view put forward by the hon. Member. I do not desire to carry the matter further, because it is a delicate matter, but the hon. Members does sometimes assume that he knows more than the Dominion Governments and than those members of the Government who have been sitting in Cabinet with Dominion Ministers.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;11;I am afraid that is what the hon. Member did suggest.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;45;I certainly saw a statement. There was a statement, which we can look up in the OFFICIAL REPORT, very much on those lines. I have also seen it in a report of one of the hon. Member's weekend speeches, which are always very well reported.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;57;The assumption of the hon. Member was that the incapacity of the Government did not allow them to be strong enough at all points. [Interruption.] Let us have it clear. I have a quotation from a speech made by the hon. Member on 13th November, in which he discussed this very thing and in which he said: 
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;110;Quite. He took the view that we should put our Forces in to support Russia. How much stronger would his case have been if he could have said that our Forces were immobilised in the Far East. He was not thinking of the Far East. He was thinking that rather than divide our Forces it might be better to let everything go in the Near East and throw everything into Russia. That is a sound strategic line, but it is a very different thing from going around and telling people that it is only the fault of the Government that we cannot have enough Forces. That is a curious optimism.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;15;Perhaps my hon. Friend is looking at the wrong page. This is what he said: 
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;24;It is always possible for the hon. Member to vie with himself, so to speak, but I take it that he really intended that.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;147;Yes. My hon. Friend is the man who, himself, shows a lack of strategic judgment. Upon all those points he has never thought out what the problem was He has thought that it was so easy, and that everything was a mistake, because he has never realised the kind of thing we have been up against. We have been up against a tremendous military machine and now we are up against another great military machine, and the hon. Member says that we have made great mistakes in our strategic judgments. I wonder what that means? Does it mean that, a year ago, the hon. Member would have put all our available forces into Singapore? Is that what he thinks would be sound strategic judgment? Or perhaps his sound strategic judgment would have said that we must not put troops into Libya but must keep them at home.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;7;Is that a matter of naval strategy?
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;100;That may be, so, but we are bound to rely upon the expert advice of experienced naval officers. [AN HON. MEMBER: "We judge by results."] That is the danger of judging by results. In all war there is nothing more dangerous than to judge entirely by results, without considering conditions. War is not betting on a certainty. Every great commander, whether at sea or on land, has had to take risks. When those risks have come off, people say "wonderful strategic judgment." If something does not come off, every person who knows nothing about it says, "shocking bad strategic judgment."
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;331;I would prefer to get the views, which I have not yet got, of the responsible naval officers rather than to rely on the a priori view of the hon. and gallant Member, even though he also has had a naval career. Then there is the hon. Member for Kidderminster. He is another Member with rose-coloured spectacles. He said that we were deceived about the position in the Far East. He has had great experience, but I do not think he could ever have been deceived had he looked at the situation. No Member who looked at this matter on the map, and considered the forces which Japan had, could have been deceived into thinking it was easy to defend the Malay Peninsula. The hon. Member said, "We have been deceived." I gather he was deceived because a general, in an Order of the Day to his troops, did not say, "We are in an awful position; we shall be beaten." I am sure he would not form his judgment on that. He knew perfectly well that the position in the Pacific depended upon command of the sea and that we had not got that. The command of the sea went very badly for us after those first attacks. When you consider the defence of that long peninsula, you must realise that you could put your troops in there, but if you had not got command of the sea—and that coast is a very long one—you would be faced with the possibility of being outflanked. He asked: Had we noticed Singora? Of course we had, but it was in Thailand. Thailand was not British territory; it was under the influence of Japan but was still an independent country. Of course, we had our plans made, but could we have attacked Thailand and brought war upon us from Japan without any assurance of United States support? In that case, Singora would have been only a trap. These things, believe me, are considered.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;157;Of course we made our preparations there. But, as I say, the defence of Malaya depended on sea power. We were weak there. Could we, then, go out and invite attack by telling everybody that we were frightfully weak there? I have never concealed from anybody the dangers and difficulties we saw in connection with Japan, but is it a right thing to state that publicly and invite attack by saying, "This is a very weak place. Japan, come in"? The hon. Member for Seaham took the line, I gather, that what we gave to Russia was small, that 1,000 tanks or 1,000 aircraft would be very small, and a great deal of his speech was devoted to the question of our supply. It was not until the very end of that speech that the most vital factor of all, though it is the subject on which he has very great knowledge, that is, the shipping question—
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;119;If the hon. Member had joined us, we should have been glad of his help. The short answer is, that what he does not seem to realise is that the shipping position invalidated the whole of the rest of his speech. That is what conditions how much stuff you can send out, at what time, and what operations you can carry on. What is the good of pointing the finger of scorn at us and saying, "You have even less shipping than when the war started," after we had the Battle of the Atlantic, after we had carried supplies to the Far East and the Near East and everywhere else, after we had had tremendous attacks on our Fleet?
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;13;No, I am saying that the hon. Member is ignoring that tremendous Service.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;54;The hon. Member may not think so, but I thought that the whole of the first half of his speech, which was one long sneer, was vitiated by the fact that he did not realise this vital part of our war effort, and that the existence of this difficulty made nonsense of his argument.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;246;I do not mind criticism. And I shall never lack it while the hon. Member is about. Another point that has been raised is whether we are making full use of the man-power of Asia. That question was raised by the hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. Haden Guest), my right hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh, and other Members. It is true that there is a great reservoir of men in the Indies, Malaya, and elsewhere, but the mass of them are untrained and unarmed. Everybody knows that after our losses in France we were hard put to it to arm our Regular troops, much less our Home Guard, for the defence of this country. Everyone will agree that that armament had to have priority. Secondly, we had to arm for the Libyan campaign.  We had to build up our Army. Obviously, you have to allot arms to the people who are to be trained first and who are nearest the most immediate point of danger. If those arms had been sent out for large armies in Malaya or India, Members of this House would have got up to ask why we had not armed the Home Guard. The second point is that, while there has been an immense increase of recruiting for the Indian Army, the amount of troops that could be raised at one time is necessarily restricted by the amount of the training cadres we have of—the amount of trained personnel.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;28;At that time there was tremendous pressure upon machine tools everywhere. We had to get anything we could from America, and we could not scrape up enough here.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;321;We have also to make use of trained workers on the spot. After Dunkirk it was a bit of a hurried job. The hon. Member for South Croydon seemed to have very bitter memories of the time when he was an Under-Secretary and that an under-secretary's life is not a happy one, and I gather that he seemed to know surprisingly little about the working of government. It is not very sensible to make the kind of suggestion that at the Defence Committee the Chiefs of Staff sit round silently and listen to long lectures by the Prime Minister, and because they are officers they are afraid to open their mouths. That is entirely untrue. No Chief of Staff, no First Lord and no Chief of the Air Staff would be fit to hold his job unless he was prepared to argue his case and put it freely and without fear before the Committee of Defence. I can assure hon. Members that the imaginary picture drawn by the hon. Member for South Croydon is entirely untrue. I do not think that attitude is very fair when at the same time the Prime Minister is represented as someone who will never listen to anybody else and as a dictator. Believe me, that is quite wrong. The Prime Minister is not a person who will take exception to people arguing nor is he a person who claims that apart from the rest of the Government his word is good all the time. As a matter of fact, he is one man working in a team. I suggest it is not a good thing to hear Members suggesting that the Prime Minister is a dictator. It is not very helpful when we are fighting against a dictatorship. The Prime Minister has always been a sound democratic man and a sound House of Commons man, and anybody less like a dictator you could not find.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;24;I mean not only generalised good will but specialised good will. Believe me, the Government have not an absolutely closed mind on this question.
1942-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1942-1-28;Motion Of Confidence In His Majesty's Government;198;Certainly, I have always considered them. I think the principles I put forward were perfectly sound, and I have only to modify them in accordance with actual conditions as I find them. I think the hon. Member for Seaham will find that he will have to do the same when he comes to apply his theories, should he ever take office. As I have said, the Government have not closed their minds on this question of the organisation of production, but I think it is a mistake to think that all the difficulties can be got rid of by putting in a kind of superman to run the whole thing. I notice that the hon. Member for the Eye Division of Suffolk at one time appealed to the Chancellor to look at the matter from a monetary point of view and at another time to a Minister to look at it from a production point of view. I say, frankly, that while we must keep down costs and so on, the things that matter most are machinery, materials and man-power rather than pounds, shillings and pence. That is the point of view which must be borne in mind.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;75;Two years ago we borrowed another £1,000 million sterling from them, or nearly four billion dollars. I asked the other day a rhetorical question, "What are dollars?" Dollars are the result of the toil and the skill of the American working man, and he is willing to give them on a very large scale to the cause of rebuilding our broken world. In many cases he gives them without much prospect of repayment. Shabby moneylenders!
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;131;I am capable of deciding for myself. That evil can always be corrected by production. Where prices rise in spite of abundance, it is not a sign of evil, but often of strength. It must have been a heart-shaking decision of the American Government and of the President, who has great executive power, to abandon price controls and, as it were, throw the reins upon the horse's neck. The strong horse is pulling the wagon out of the mire. I know what many hopes are on the opposite side of the House, but they will not be cheered by the results. We have a strong horse too. He is not so large but he is strong. Alas, he is bitted and bridled and hobbled and haltered till he can hardly move.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;20;I merely recited the history of those days, and that is the latest precedent which is available upon the subject.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;277;It must be clear-almost clear enough for the right hon. Gentleman, even in his most comprehending moments. The object and spirit of the Parliament Act was not to enable the House of Lords to veto the will of the people, but to make sure that the will of the people was, in fact, made effective. For this purpose the life of a House of Commons was reduced from seven to five years, and a provision was inserted to enable a Bill to be carried forward under the Parliament Act procedure across a General Election. The Dissolution of Parliament in no way affects the efficacy of the Parliament Act. No Government are hampered by it in carrying through their legislation unless they are afraid that the people will not support them at the polls. The fact that the Government now wish to shorten the term of the suspensory powers of the second Chamber proves conclusively that they fear they would be defeated at a General Election. What they are, therefore, trying to do is not to give effect to the will of the people, but to carry through their party legislation irrespective of the will of the people. This is not democracy. It is  authoritarianism. [An HON. MEMBER: "What an incredible muddle."] I quite understand that may be the hon. Member's condition. Total powers are to be given to any Government obtaining power at a General Election, no matter how abnormal the conditions of that election, to carry whatever legislation they choose during their five years spell, irrespective of whether the people wish for that legislation, and irrespective of whether the Government still have their confidence or not.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;155;We will come to that in a minute. What is now proposed is, virtually, single-chamber Government, and the granting to the Cabinet, which already has taken it in time of peace, the whole of the arbitrary wartime powers and regulations—a monstrous invasion of our liberties and a vile breach of faith between man and man who have to work together. What they are now proposing to do is to obtain for the Cabinet irresistible power to pass any Measures they may wish to bring forward, without regard to the will of the people or to their own foundation in public confidence. This is a formidable issue to fling out at this time of economic crisis—at this time when, in full peace, despotic wartime powers are ruling—and to be flung out, not as a result of grave historic and prolonged constitutional controversies, but as a cheap, paltry, disreputable deal between jarring nonentities in a divided Administration.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;9;The Lord President ought to be pleased about that.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;7;They said all would be much better.

1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;142;Will the right hon. Gentleman be so kind as to allow me to direct his attention also to the comparison which I made, because after the first world war there was no havoc by bombing? There were not a million houses knocked down, and hardly any damage here. I do not remember that housing was at that time one of the leading questions. We had many other matters, and grave labour questions, but I do not think there is any comparison between that situation and this, when we have a million houses destroyed. Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why, not now but even in the year 1949, only 140,000 houses are to be constructed here, with all our efforts, when before the war, with no particular effort at all, just in the normal working, as many as 350,000 houses were completed?
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;25;No. I said that if certain conditions were fulfilled and" among them, a blood bath was avoided, then I was free to give my congratulations.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;70;The right hon. Gentleman should realise that Palestine is a mandated area, and as he and his colleagues have broken their pledges to the Zionists, there was no moral reason why we should not, and every practical reason why we should, give the Mandate back to the United Nations organisation.  There is a great difference between British territory built up and held for generations and a Mandate which we accepted
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;9;There is nothing in the Parliament Act about that.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;83;The right hon. Gentleman must be very hard up to find something to say. Since when have I been in favour of the House of Lords having the power of Dissolution? I have never heard of such a doctrine and I should be absolutely opposed to it. They have a control given them by Parliament over legislation, but they have absolutely no power to determine the length of the sittings of this House, nor when there should be an appeal to the country.
1947-10-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-10-28;Government Policy;69;I must really clear the right hon. Gentleman's mind. If a Measure is sent back under the suspensory veto of the House of Lords, there is no obligation upon the Government to go to the country. There is no obligation to go to the country before the expiration of their full normal term, and they lose nothing by that because the procedure of the Parliament Act carries on properly.

Such expressions of opinion by officials would, usually, have regard to technical aspects only. Of course, in an emergency, exceptions may be made. The principle of Ministerial responsibility to Parliament is paramount.

1948-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-3-24;Clause 3—(Adaptation Of 7 & 8 Geo 6 C 41);98;Is it not a fact that when the Boundary Commission presented its report, its functions were discharged, and in the main it has stated its opinion as to the fair distribution of the seats? Is it not a fact, also, that the Government desired to know whether the Boundary Commission would deal further with the matter, and were they not informed that the Commission could not act in a collective capacity any more? Were they not then reduced to obtaining the individual advice and opinion of former members of a Boundary Commission, which in this matter was defunct?
1948-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-3-24;Clause 3—(Adaptation Of 7 & 8 Geo 6 C 41);4;I think it is.

I have not in the slightest degree concealed in public speech how much I regretted the course of events in Egypt. But I had not held my mind closed to the tremendous changes that have taken place in the whole strategic position in the world which make the thoughts which were well-founded and well knit together a year ago utterly obsolete, and which have changed the opinions of every competent soldier that I have been able to meet.
1954-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-7-29;Suez Canal Zone Base (Anglo-Egyptian Agreement);43;I was not complaining about that. What I was complaining about was that there is a complete lack of defence in the area.

1940-2-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-07;Merchant Shipbuilding And Repairs;91;I am aware of the figures referred to by the hon. Member.  The position is that all available shipbuilding berths in South Shields are occupied with merchant ship building orders. The volume of ship repair work is bound to fluctuate and the policy is to spread such work over the country as far as possible. The facilities at South Shields will be fully borne in mind both for repair work and naval conversion work. All will be needed. The January unemployment figure at South Shields in this industry fell to 521.

1940-2-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-07;Merchant Shipbuilding And Repairs;33;The answer to both parts of the Question is in the negative. There is no intention of preventing shipbuilding on private account, and the Admiralty is responsible for issuing licences for this purpose.

At any rate, we should certainly wish to lay the whole position frankly before the House.
1952-6-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-6-16;South Korea (Political Developments);45;Yes. When Lord Alexander comes back I am sure we shall want to hear everything he has to tell us in the Government; and also a statement on this, I think, valuable mission of his must certainly be an important feature in our discussions here.
1943-7-27-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-7-27;Italy And The War;194;The House will have heard with satisfaction of the downfall of one of the principal criminals of this desolating war. The end of Mussolini's long and severe reign over the Italian people undoubtedly marks the close of an epoch in the life of Italy. The keystone of the Fascist arch has crumbled, and, without attempting to prophesy, it does not seem unlikely that the entire Fascist edifice will fall to the ground in ruins, if it has not already so fallen. The totalitarian system of a single party, armed with secret police, engrossing to itself practically all the offices, even the humblest, under the Government, with magistrates and courts under the control of the executive, with its whole network of domestic spies and neighbourly informants—that system when applied over a long period of time, leaves the broad masses without any influence upon their country's destinies and without any independent figures apart from the official classes. That, I think, is a defence for the people of Italy—one defence—although there can be no real valid defence for any country or any people which allows its freedom and inherent rights to pass out of its own hands.

I do not think that we realised, when illness forced him to give up the position he was holding in this House, that that illness would so soon terminate fatally. I think that during his tenure of the Deputy-Chairmanship he had commanded the respect of the whole House. He was courteous, he understood the duties of the Chair, he was impartial, he served the House faithfully. I am sure that we are all very sorry that he had no time to rest after those arduous duties, and the sympathy of all of us will go out to his wife and son.

The late Mr. Beaumont discharged the difficult and delicate duties in the Chair at the Table with complete impartiality, with great knowledge of the rules of the House, with much indulgence and courtesy towards Members, and with a full understanding of the traditions of this House which are not contained in any book or code of rules. On this side of the House we felt indebted to him for the necessary services which he rendered, and we share with the Prime Minister and the Government party, to the full, the deep regret with which we have learned of his untimely death. He died in harness. The interval between his presiding over the Debates in this House and the ending of his life was very short indeed, but at any rate all his days, of which we have so much knowledge in the House, were well spent and were to the credit of those great institutions on which in this difficult period the life and freedom of Britain depend.

1944-4-26-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1944-4-26;Armed Forces (Disorders);63;We shall certainly try to get representatives in that Government of those who are really fighting the enemy; some of them seem to be more busy fighting their own countrymen.

There will be further changes, not only consequential changes, among the Undersecretaries, but these I have not yet had time to consider in all their bearings. After nearly two years of strain and struggle it was right and necessary that a Government called into being in the crash of the Battle of France should undergo both change and reinvigoration. I regret very much the loss of loyal and trusted colleagues, with whom I have come through so many hard times and who readily placed their resignations in my hand in order to facilitate a reconstruction of the Government. They had, of course, no greater share of responsibility than the rest of the Administration for the disasters which have fallen upon us in the Far East. Nevertheless, I am sure that we have achieved a more tensely-braced and compact Administration to meet the new dangers and difficulties which are coming upon us, and I believe that that is the general opinion of the House and of the country 
1942-2-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1942-2-24;Ministerial Changes;179;Upon this situation, which I have so very briefly outlined to the House, there suddenly came the impact of Japan, a new combatant, long scheming and preparing, with a warlike population of 80,000,000, several millions of trained soldiers and a vast amount of modern material. This mighty impact fell upon our wide, prosperous but lightly-defended possessions and establishments throughout the Far East, all of which had, rightly, been kept at the very lowest level on account of the imperative requirements of the European and African theatres. I saw that some gentlemen who escaped from Penang announced to the world with much indignation that there was not a single antiaircraft gun in the place. Where should we have been, I would like to know, if we had spread our limited anti-aircraft guns throughout the immense, innumerable regions and vulnerable points of the Far East instead of using them to preserve the vital life of our ports and factories here and of our fortresses which were under continuous attack and all our operations with the field Armies in the Middle East?

Surely that ought to be considered. The ld. now really does not cover anything that we are confronted with under the present dispensation.

With this object in view, a number of appointments have been made, under arrangements concerted generally by the Historical Section of the War Cabinet Office, formerly of the Committee of Imperial Defence. I am circulating in the OFFICIAL REPORT a list of the Departments covered by these arrangements, which may be extended as thought necessary to other Departments whose war-time activities could with advantage be recorded in this way.

That Report is under consideration by the Government; it involves complicated and important issues, and no statement can yet be made. When the Government has come to its conclusions on the Report it will consider whether any inferences can be drawn as to modifications in by-election arrangements in war-time. While it is the wish of His Majesty's Government that all possible eligible persons should have the right to record their votes, I think it proper to warn the House that the technical and practical difficulties may be formidable. It is in any case not possible for the Government to reach any conclusion as to by-elections meantime, so that I am not able to give an answer of a favourable character to the hon. Member's request. In the meantime constituencies without the services of a Member will naturally expect us to take the usual steps to enable the  vacancies to be filled, and I therefore trust the House will assent to the Writ being issued.

Gentleman has declared himself, after 18 months of protracted delay, incapable of offering any solution? How does he justify keeping 100,000 British soldiers in Palestine, who are needed here, and spending £30 million to £40 million a year from our diminishing resources upon this vast apparatus of protraction and delay?

We all bear witness to the exhaustive efforts he has made, and to speak of delay is in no sense a reflection on his personal devotion to duty. But I am entitled to ask the question whether what has been announced today does not mean that at least a year will pass, while the British Government remain, on their own confession, without any solution of the Palestine problem, before any solution is provided from another quarter; and  whether that is not exposing us to an unduly heavy burden, both in the absorption of our manpower, and in the further depletion of our financial resources? If this policy is right today—and this is another question I wish to ask—why could it not have been announced 12 months ago?

The kind of criticism we have had to-day, some of it very searching, is the kind of criticism that the Government not only accept but welcome. All the same, the House will, permit me perhaps to point out that the way in which this Debate came about was calculated to give one the feeling of a challenge to the security of the Administration, and, from the point of view of the advantage to the country, that raises serious considerations. There were all kinds of paragraphs and reports which appeared in the papers about the grave uneasiness and unrest, stating that a Debate on Crete must take place. The parties were demanding it, the Labour party, the Liberal party and members of the Conservative party were demanding it, and there must be a full accounting, an inquest held, and so forth. That being so, one is bound to take a serious view because of the interests which are confided into our care.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;215;I thought that I had misquoted my right hon. Friend in some way, but it appears he wished to continue the argument. I am dealing not with the particular equipment of the troops who went to France, who naturally drained the rest of our Forces, but the fact remains that the equipment of our Army at that time, and at the outbreak of war, was of the most meagre and deficient character, and that the deficiencies made themselves most marked—and still make themselves most marked—in the very type of weapons for which there is the greatest possible demand. I could give facts and figures upon this point if we were in private which would, I think, leave no dispute upon the subject. I am not throwing all the blame for this upon my right hon. Friend at all—certainly not —but I think it is only fair, when he himself comes forward and sets himself up as an arbiter and judge, and speaks so scornfully of the efforts of some others who have inherited his dismal legacy, I think when he speaks in this way—he has a great responsibility in the matter—it is only fair to point out to him that he is one of the last people in this country entitled to take that line.

1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;200;The hon. Member for Eye (Mr. Granville) had better return to his lucubrations in constitutional experiment, which exercise his mind so much at present. So much for the difficulty in which we stand in the matter of the anti-aircraft guns. The output is at last rapidly expanding, but the fact remains that our outfits are incomparably inferior in numbers to those possessed by the Germans, and every claim has to be weighed against every other claim. Another general question which may fairly be asked is, "Why have we not got much stronger and much larger air forces in the Middle East?" I can only say this: From the moment when the Battle of Britain was decided in our favour, in September and October of last year, by the victories of our fighters, we have been ceaselessly sending aircraft as fast as possible to the Middle East, by every route and by every method. During the present year, as our strength in the air has grown, we have not been hampered in this matter, as we were in the case of the antiaircraft guns, by lack of aircraft. The problem has been to send them to the Eastern theatre of war.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;212;Not transportation in the sense of shipping tonnage, but in the sense of the time that it takes to transfer under the conditions of the present war. It is not aircraft, but transportation, which is the limiting factor at this end. I have dealt with anti-aircraft guns; I have dealt with aircraft. As to the disposition of our Air Force in the Middle East, it is primarily a matter for the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle East, although His Majesty's Government share to the full their responsibility for whatever is done. I might refer again to what was said by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Lewes (Rear-Admiral Beamish) about the importance of coordination between the Services. It is carried to a very high pitch. The Chief Air Officer lives in the same house in Cairo as the Commander-in-Chief. They are there side by side. The Naval Commander-in-Chief has to be at sea very often. He has to be at Alexandria. But the very closest association exists between these branches. The idea that any one of these problems would be studied by one of these commanders only, without the closest association with the other two is quite an illusory idea, and I can really assure my hon. Friend on that point.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;273;It is not so much a question of the final say. No disagreement that I know of has arisen. Obviously, the Army is the main factor in that business, and the Fleet is preserving the security of the Army on the seas, and preserving the command of the seas, and the Air is assisting the Army and the Fleet in all their functions. But in the event of any differences, they can be settled in a few hours by reference here. These Commanders-in-Chief have to  settle it among themselves, although we share to the full responsibility for whatever is done. It must not be forgotten that apart from the effort we made in Greece, which was very costly in aircraft, the situation in Iraq, in Palestine, and potentially in Syria, as well as the winding-up of the Abyssinian story, all made very heavy demands upon our aircraft, and the situation in the Western Desert had also to be considered. Before any rational judgment could be formed upon the disposition of our Air Force and the consequent failure to supply an adequate Air Force for Crete, it would be necessary, as in the case of the anti-aircraft guns, to know not only what are our whole resources, but also what is the situation in these other theatres, which were all, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Lees-Smith) pointed out, all intimately interrelated, and it is no use trying to judge these matters without full knowledge, and that full knowledge obviously cannot be made public, and ought not to be spread outside the narrowest circle compatible with the execution of operations.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;78;I would have liked very much to have stopped them, and in some cases I have reduced them in number. I think it is a very risky thing to ask a professional officer, naval, military or air, to give a weekly expatiation on the war when, in the nature of things, although he may be very accomplished in his profession, he cannot know and ought not to know the facts as they are understood at the secret meetings.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;214;I am very glad to see the feeling in the House on the subject, because, on the other side, one is appealed to ceaselessly to give more information, to make the war more interesting to the people, and to tell them more about what is going on. But it is not possible for the head of the Government or even for the Chiefs of Staff to vet—to use a slang term—beforehand these detailed weekly statements which are made. I think the matter must certainly be reconsidered. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] As I have said, no one had any illusions about the tremendous scale of the air-borne attack, the greatest ever delivered in the world, or thought that we should resist it without any but the most restricted air support on our side. That is the fact. It is not a nice case, but it is the fact. Let us look at the anatomy of this battle of Crete which was undertaken in those bleak circumstances. We hoped that the 25,000 to 30,000 good troops—I am making it a little vague—with artillery and a proportion of tanks, aided by the Greek forces, would be able to destroy the parachute and glider landings of the enemy and prevent him from using the airfields or the harbours.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;135;I certainly will. The right hon. Gentleman associated himself with a very strong movement there has been for a much greater development of the air force which is actually associated with the Army. Last year, when we were considering our affairs, the great need was to multiply fighters and  bombers. It became an enormously important matter. Nevertheless, portions of the Army co-operation squadrons were associated with the military forces, but not on the scale which was desirable or to the extent which was desirable. I think it is of the utmost consequence that every division, especially every armoured division, should have a chance to live its daily life and training in a close and precise relationship with a particular number of aircraft that it knows and that it can call up at will and need.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;137;Certainly, for the purposes of everything that is a tactical operation. It was not possible last year to provide it on a large scale without trenching on other domains which were more vital to our safety, but it is the intention to go forward upon that path immediately and to provide the Army with a larger number, a considerably larger number, of aeroplanes suited entirely to the work they have to do, and above all to the development of that wireless connection between the ground forces and the air which the Germans have carried to such an extraordinary point of perfection. If this had been done in Crete, it would not have made any difference to the event there, because the numbers there for the purpose of cooperating with the troops could not have altered the event.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;103;I read into the word the meaning most people read into it; when he said productivity was falling off, I took it to mean not (he effort of each man but the general production. I felt I must contradict his statement today because it happens that I have heard from two foreign countries in the course of the morning of the very serious effect which this statement produced upon opinions there; how it was published rapidly throughout Spain, for instance, and given the greatest prominence coming as it did from an ex-Secretary of State. It was said to be exercising a bad effect.
1941-6-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-10;Defence Of Crete;130;I do not see any difficulty in reconciling that. The Minister might be urging the men to make greater efforts, he might say that this particular lot of airfields were falling behind, what the programme actually was, but that is quite a different thing from saying that the productivity of our factories is falling off. I must say I do not think we are in a sufficiently safe position to allow ourselves the full luxuries of vehement statements upon these very grave matters. As I say, we have many things we may be thankful for. In the  first place, we have not been overwhelmed by the air attack; and our production, far from being beaten down by the disorganisation of that attack, has been increasing at a very high rate.

At any rate, it seems most necessary to emphasise that.

It certainly would not be worth while addressing the present House on the subject unless its sittings are to be prolonged into the late summer. The right hon.

Two awards could not be given to the Army unless a similar duplication were permitted to the Navy and the Air Force. The complications are therefore obvious.

I think it would be a difficult question to thrash out in public, from various points of view. I think that there is a good deal to be said on both sides of the argument. On the whole I have become convinced that it is an advantage to the United States to have contacts which in our case no longer exist.

Would not the right hon. Gentleman consider whether this statue, which, I am told, is a very fine work of art, might not receive special consideration, even though the monuments to some famous admirals were put in some different place?

I do not think there are such very great differences between us. Certainly I must say, as I have been referred to in the Debate, that there is no part of the powers conferred on His Majesty's Government in this time of trial that I view with greater repugnance than these powers of exceptional process against the liberty of the subject without the ordinary safeguards which are inherent in British life. Those high-sounding familiar phrases like "Habeas Corpus," "petitioner's right," "charges made which are known to the law," and "trial by jury"—all these are part of what we are fighting to preserve. We all care about them and understand them, and we are determined that they shall not be in-roaded upon by anything except the need of self-preservation which arises in time of war.

1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);15;Does this statement mean that we pay and we go, or only that we go?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);79;The statement does not mean that we go. It means that the people of Burma have the right to decide in the future whether they should stay in the Commonwealth or go outside. Therefore, there is no decision to go. Secondly, with regard to finance, it is interim finance, and it concerns certain interest-free loans, which were decided upon by  the previous Government, and have been continued by this Government, for the reconstruction of Burma in the interim period.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);18;We have to pay the money irrespective of whether Burma remains in the Commonwealth and Empire or not?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);88;I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will remember that at the present moment Burma is within the Commonwealth, and that Burma suffered seriously in the war, both by damage from the enemy and by damage which was ordered by His Majesty's Government for the purpose of delaying the enemy. It is, therefore, perfectly reasonable that we should continue to assist Burma irrespective of what future decisions may be taken. The right hon. Gentleman will find the full details set out in the annexe to the White Paper.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);16;The answer to my question is that we are first to pay, and then to go?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);67;The right hon. Gentleman's logical faculty seems to have deserted him. There is no decision here to go. There is no decision to pay in the future. There are interim payments which are in the form of loans, and the decision as to whether to go or to stay is for the Burmese people. It really cannot be reduced down to a proposition which is entirely inaccurate.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);22;May I ask the Prime Minister whether he will, in the near future, afford us an opportunity of debating this dismal transaction?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);69;Certainly, but I think the House will agree that there should first be given time for the Burmese Delegation to return to Burma and discuss the matter. I am hoping the Debate will be no more dismal than was the Debate of 41 years ago in which the right hon. Gentleman had to suffer from some criticisms from those gentlemen who then sat on that side of the House.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);26;I have not had any suggestion made. I have no reason to think that all proper precautions will not be taken to conduct the elections properly.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);54;The noble Lord is correct. I would not like to say how many times in the course of the discussions I emphasised the point that all we could do was to make an agreement with them, and propose a certain line and make certain proposals, but that the decision must rest with this House.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);39;Certainly, there will be no attempt to delay. On the contrary, we hope to get this forward as quickly as possible. There should not be any delay in coming to a decision. There is no intention whatever of delaying.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);100;No, there have been various statements made, rather contradictory, but there is a conference being held this month in which the various frontier peoples will be meeting, and I hope that, either at that conference or at a subsequent conference, we shall get a full indication of their views. With regard to the Karens—I take it the right hon. Gentleman means the Karens in the  plains and not those in Karenni—there was no specific Karen Delegation, because this was a Delegation of members of the Executive Council. The proposal is that the Karens should be represented in the Constituent Assembly.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);17;They were two representatives who belonged to separate parties. I cannot say what numbers they actually represented.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);69;It will be exploratory. There is a double thing here. We want to see that the people of Ministerial Burma and the people of the plains have a full opportunity of discussing the matter with one another, and we want to assure ourselves as to what are the views of the people of the frontier areas, and the mission is merely to facilitate things, and also to collect information.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);43;On the first point, I cannot say exactly how long. It would be useless to try to give a timetable, because we do not know. With regard to the other point, I think the agreement is in general accord with the Atlantic Charter.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);69;Is the right hon. Gentleman not aware, or does he not remember, that when we were asked in this House, after the Atlantic Charter, about its application to Eastern countries and. other parts of the British Empire, a very full and precise statement was made by me, from his place, to which he was a consenting party beforehand? Would he kindly refresh his memory some time by reading it?
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-1-28;United Kingdom And Burma (Agreement);39;I will certainly refresh my memory on that, but as I remember, it's tenor was that we ourselves were carrying out the principles of the Atlantic Charter in the Empire and Commonwealth, because we were moving progressively towards self-government.

Before this latest pronouncement of theirs, His Majesty's Government had already departed from the Cripps Mission declaration of 1942, and they had departed from it in three major aspects. First, they had eliminated the stage of Dominion status. The Cripps Mission expressly said that the objective was the creation of a new Indian Union which would constitute a Dominion associated with the United Kingdom and the other Dominions by common allegiance to the Crown, but equal to them in every respect, in no way subordinated in any aspect of domestic or external affairs.

1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);63;That is so. Certainly it will be expected of him to make a statement. There is one point, however, on which we ought to have some information today, because it is material to the issues before us. Was the Viceroy in favour of the time limit, or was he not? I hope that we should have some information on that point, at least.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);12;We do not often find ourselves thinking on similar lines—not in agreement.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);315;David, keep quiet. [Laughter.] We are old allies, and do not interfere with each other when we are in action. As I say, I read the speech of the hon. Member for Gateshead. We do not often find ourselves in agreement or thinking along similar lines. Nor am I in agreement with much that he said last night. But it is a fact that I had already intended myself to strike the note of the United Nations being brought into the Indian problem. I have for some time pressed upon His Majesty's Government that, if they are unable to carry out their pledges in Palestine or keep order there, they should return their Mandate, or, at any rate, invoke the aid of U.N.O. to help them in their work; and that, after six or seven months' delay—a needless delay—they have actually done. Now, is it not difficult to resist the feeling that the same train of reasoning applies on a far greater scale and with much stronger force to India? We are told that we cannot walk out of Palestine because we should leave behind us a war between 600,000 Jews and 200,000 Arabs. How, then, can we walk out of India in 14 months and leave behind us a war between 90 million Muslims and 200 million caste Hindus, and all the other tribulations which will fall upon the helpless population of 400 million? Will it not be a terrible disgrace to our name and record if, after our 14 months' time limit, we allow one fifth of the population of the globe, occupying a region nearly as large as Europe, to fall into chaos  and into carnage? Would it not be a world crime that we should be committing, a crime that would stain—not merely strip us, as we are being stripped, in the material position—but would stain our good name for ever?
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);11;We are not likely to lose our tempers with each other.

1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);30;I did not use the word "force." I used the word "press." I have not my notes with me now, but at any rate there is not much in it.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);54;The right hon. Gentle man and his colleagues did make a great constructive contribution in the shape of a plan, both of procedure and long-term results. Whether they forced or pressed this on them we need not argue about, but they no doubt commended it to the Indians with all the address they had.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);93;I said nothing about Mr. Nehru except that he had very good reason to be a bitter enemy of all connected with Britain—very good reason. [HON. MEMBERS: "Men of straw."] That did not specially refer to Mr. Nehru, but it does refer to the political leaders, of all the Indian parties, who have no authority. I have certainly not made any personal attack upon Mr. Nehru, except to point out that he has good reason to be our bitterest enemy in that he has been for 10 or 12 years interned in gaol.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);85;I do not repent at all. I went out of my way, when I spoke on the last occasion on India, to draw attention to Mr. Nehru's courageous action in ordering the troops to fire on his own co-religionists in Bihar when the Government officers had failed in their duty. I have not said anything derogatory to his character, but he is an enemy of this country, and has every right to be if he chooses. That, I think, it is perfectly proper to say.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);50;On a point of Order, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I should very much have liked myself to refer to Lord Halifax's speech in the other House, but I understood the rule was that we could not make references to speeches in another place. I should be glad if the rule were relaxed.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);223;The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Saffron Walden (Mr. R. A. Butler) has spoken with his usual care, courtesy, lucidity and knowledge on this subject. I think he started with one point on which I entirely agree with him, because, having sat through all the Debates prior to the 1935 Act, I am quite prepared to admit that the Conservative Party is as united on Indian questions as it was then. I have no doubt that this has been fully borne out in this Debate. We have had a very interesting Debate, illuminated, as Debates are in this House, by hon. Members who have great practical experience of this problem. I was very much impressed by the speeches by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Reed), the hon. and gallant Member for Sudbury (Lieut.-Colonel Hamilton), and the hon. and gallant Member for Down (Sir W. Smiles), whom I remember so well when I was in India and he was in Assam on the Legislative Council of the Assam Government. I noticed one thing—that the more recent  and the more complete the experience of hon. Members, the less were their speeches ready to condemn outright the decision of the Government. Indeed, as I pointed out, there were speeches in support of it that were not confined to this side of the House.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);143;We were near the end of the war, and were planning for the future, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman was as confident as I was of how well we were getting on at that time. [An HON. MEMBER: "What was the date?"] It was April, 1945, near the end of the war. We took this matter up with my right hon. Friends who went to India and, there, again, it was said that it would not be useful. I rather pressed it myself, because I thought some strengthening would be useful, but we were told that it would not be useful. But even if it were desired to strengthen slightly the British cadre, it really would not do what the right hon. Gentleman wanted. It is very strange for him, but I think he must have missed something here.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);2;In India.
1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);122;In India. I agree that they are not much interested. You have to govern India through educated Indians. You cannot suddenly take in members of the Depressed Classes, and put them in to govern a Province, or anything of that kind. You have to govern with Indian people, and they are the politically educated classes. As long as 18 years ago, when I was in India, I realised that the wave of nationalist feeling had extended beyond politicians. Nationalist feeling runs right through all the Indian classes. That is the reason why you cannot carry on against the will of the Indian people. All our advice has been to the effect that to strengthen the administration would not get over the difficulties.

1947-3-06-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1947-3-06;India (Government Policy);179;I will come to them later. The right hon. Gentleman is anticipating me. The fact is, as everybody knows, that one cannot change the Hindu social system from outside by alien rule. These things have to be done by Indians, and whatever is put into treaties, as has been said, ultimately it rests upon the Indians themselves. I come to the point that was mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition—the moneylenders There is gross in equality of wealth in India, but unfortunately, that social and economic system was continued during all the time of our rule. We did not go in for the revolutionary business of turning out the land lords who do nothing whatever. We did something to repress the moneylenders, but not much. We accepted that social and economic system. Why are we told now, at the very end of our rule, that we must clear up all these things before we go, otherwise we shall betray our trust? If that trust is there, it ought to have been fulfilled long ago.

1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Attlee).txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);14;With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement to the House.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);79;—but these advances are spread very unevenly over industry. In many firms, and indeed in some whole industries, little or no advance in productivity has been made: if all were as good as the best our problem of production would be in a fair way to solution. If we are to seize the great opportunities for export which devaluation has opened to us, and keep up the standard of supply in the home market, we must increase our production.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);98;Naturally, it would be wrong and also mentally impossible to come to any conclusion upon the complicated and guarded statement—none the less of the gravest importance—which  the Prime Minister has made. I understand we are to have an opportunity during the present week of having a Debate on these matters, and we shall avail ourselves of the brief interlude there is to give the closest attention to what is proposed, and to do our utmost to see what is the advice which we on this side should tender to the House and the country at this serious juncture.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);33;That will, of course, be dealt with in the Debate on Wednesday and Thursday, but it was very fully dealt with by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);125;I think the right hon. Gentleman will get more information when he is able to study it a little more at leisure. I considered very carefully the question of whether one could issue a White Paper, but it is very difficult, because there is a very great range of economies coming into force at different times, and also past economies have to be brought in. Therefore, I came to the conclusion that one could not issue a White Paper without making it an enormously voluminous document. I think the matter will, of course, be opened out in Debate by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I put into my statement as much detail as I could, and I think it is quite sufficient for a Debate.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);3;That is so.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);30;I think that my hon. Friend's point, like so many other points that are being made, are points which would be better made in Debate than by question and answer.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);5;I really cannot, straight away.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);11;We are discussing the whole question of defence with our friends.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);18;I cannot say anything further on that point—no one could—than the Chancellor of the Exchequer said last week.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);19;Oh, no. Other economies are being made. Economies are being made all the time. [HON. MEMBERS: "What are they?"]
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);19;I have already pointed out that a complete review is being made of the whole question of the Forces.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);23;That is exactly what I did not say. I said that the subsidy would be withdrawn and the whole matter considered in February.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);30;I did not say that specifically. I said that we were reviewing the whole question and that it will fall into its place in the general defence of the country.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);16;I really do think it is. We have given this matter a good deal of consideration.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);8;All those matters are really matters for debate.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);24;The hon. Gentleman has missed the point. There was a vast mass of detail which it is difficult to bring into a White Paper.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);2;No, Sir.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);34;The hon. Gentleman knows well that there are laid before the House very detailed Estimates. He would not expect those all to be repeated. These figures will appear in the Estimates in due course.
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);40;Can the right hon. Gentleman give us an assurance that this reduction of about £250 million which he has proposed will be a net reduction, or will it be overtaken and swamped by other aspects and elements of national expenditure?
1949-10-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1949-10-24;Economic Situation (Government Proposals);8;It is intended to be a net reduction.
1938-3-22-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1938-3-22;Austrian Refugees Immigration And Naturalisation;7;Is not that a matter for Committee?
1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;25;(by Private Notice) asked the Prime Minister whether His Majesty's Government have considered or will consider offering their services as mediator between India and Hyderabad.
1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;53;Does the Prime Minister remember the very precise pledges which he gave about this important State of 17 million or 18 million people, that they would have the right to choose whether they would accede to Pakistan or to Hindustan—or India—and that, if not, they could remain a separate Dominion of the Crown?
1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;55;Is that not a very unrepresentative form of the precise pledges which were given to this House, that the State of Hyderabad and, I may add, the State of Kashmir, should have the right to choose which of the two Dominions in India they would accede to or, if not, to remain outside and separate?
1948-6-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1948-6-23;India And Hyderabad;11;I was not asking about jurisdiction. I was asking about obligations.
1949-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-18;Cotton Industry;23;Why is it necessary to go on with this act of party spite which has been proved to cost us all so much?
1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);8;He may conceivably have been under more stress.
1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);60;Its purpose was to relieve a considerable number of people from anxiety about their position in the country. It is quite true that it may take some time for them to adjust  their affairs in accordance with the new clemency extended to them, and that is a point on which the House may from time to time seek further information.
1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);14;My right hon. and learned Friend answered a Question earlier today on that subject.
1953-3-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-3-02;Coronation Amnesty (Deserters);18;I am not sure. It may well have been that it was not asked specifically on that point.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);36;Subject to the usual procedure, the Order in Council transferring responsibilities from the Minister of  Supply to the Lord President of the Council will take effect on 1st January. Until then, the existing arrangements will continue.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);89;I have said that, after 1st January, the Minister of Works will answer Questions here on this subject on behalf of the Lord President of the Council. [An HON. MEMBER: "Not good enough."] You do not like that; you do not like the House of Lords at all. That will be the arrangement which will be made, but, with regard to the making of atomic weapons by the Ministry of Supply, Questions on that subject will, as hitherto, be answered by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Supply.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);24;No, Sir. We have considered that a line should properly be drawn in this case, though not in every case, between research and supply.
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);42;I understand that the Lord President of the Council is being placed in charge of this matter because it is a matter of major Government policy. Should not, therefore, the response in this House be made by a member of the Cabinet?
1953-11-19-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-19;Atomic Energy (Parliamentary Questions);13;I think that the arrangement which has been made is the most convenient.
1953-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1953-11-17;Exchange Of Information;157;I have not quite completed the dispositions which will be made for answering Questions in the House generally upon the subject of atomic energy, I could not myself undertake to deal with this extremely specialised and complicated subject, and therefore I am going to propose to the House that a Minister shall be made specially chargeable. However, there are certain Questions which, though they appear to deal with the atomic issue, raise matters which are high diplomacy. This first one was naturally one which should be answered by the Minister of Supply, but I have asked my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to deal with the next two very complicated Questions. [AN HON. MEMBER:"Oh."] Certainly, we are very proud to have his assistance, and I hope that the hon. Member will remember how very much easier it is to put highly complex and difficult Questions upon the Order Paper than to give clear and positive answers.
1953-11-17-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1953-11-17;Exchange Of Information;38;I think that is rather ungrateful. I must have been too complimentary to the right hon. Gentleman. He has explained what harm any compliment from me did to him. I must really rake up a few more compliments.
1946-7-10-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1946-7-10;Food Surveys;14;Would the right hon. Gentleman state the number of persons in the clerical staff?
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Volunteer Reserve Officers (Promotions);60;The number of former members of the Royal Naval Volunteer Supplementary Reserve who have been promoted to the rank of temporary lieutenant, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, after a period of preliminary training, is about 400. The length of the training course has varied according to the qualifications which the officer already possessed and the appointment for which he was required.
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Volunteer Reserve Officers (Promotions);49;I regret that the information asked for by my hon. Friend in the first part of his Question is not available. Certain temporary officers are already serving in the rank of lieutenant-commander where their duties merit this rank, and such promotions will continue to be made in suitable cases.
1940-2-14-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-14;Volunteer Reserve Officers (Promotions);40;Yes, Sir. That problem is not confined to this class of officers or to the Admiralty, but certainly those, and other, aspects have to be taken into account in connection with promotions which are made in the emergency of war.
1940-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1940-7-18;Inventions And Suggestions;207;An immense number of suggestions and inventions are sent in to the various Departments connected with the prosecution of the war. It is the duty of each Department to examine those suggestions which deal with matters with which they are concerned, and to refer the others to the appropriate Department. I believe that, on the whole, considering the extreme pressure of the times, this work is well done by the research branches of the Departments. I should deprecate the idea that the scientists at the disposal of  the Government are tied by pre-conceived notions. I remember that, at the time when the magnetic mine appeared to be a menace, several hundred letters a day were received suggesting remedies. However, the Admiralty succeeded in solving the problem themselves almost as soon as they were able to deal with the correspondence about it. It would therefore be a mistake to assume that there is any lack of willingness or of ability to adopt new ideas. But this in no way implies that suggestions are not welcome. Correspondents in doubt about which Department to address should forward their suggestions to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which is under the special care of the Lord President of the Council.
1940-7-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1940-7-18;Inventions And Suggestions;132;It is very difficult indeed. I felt there was a good deal of force in the suggestion made, but when you come to apply it is is very difficult, because some of the matters touch tremendous secrets which are being actively examined at this time, and it is not possible to come into consultation with outsiders about them. There are many difficulties of that kind. We are most anxious to examine any suggestions of a reasonable character, and a good many that come from the public can be attended to by the Department to which they are sent or transferred to the proper Department. If there is no particular Department, there is always the Lord President of the Council's general committee of scientific research, and application to him will be attended to.

1945-8-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-8-23;Businesss Of The House;22;May I ask the Leader of the House to state the Business of the House for the first week after the Recess?
1945-8-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-8-23;Businesss Of The House;106;The right hon. Gentleman has announced a very long list of Bills for the short Sitting on Friday. I hope he does not suppose that any kind of guarantee can be given that it will be possible to deal with all those topics on a Friday. The Inshore Fishing Industry Bill, for instance, which is not a party Measure at all, like most of the others, will arouse a good deal of interest among people connected with the fishing industry. Perhaps I may be permitted to make it clear that we cannot accept any responsibility for the discharge on Friday of all that quantity of Business.
1945-8-23-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1945-8-23;Businesss Of The House;18;Could we also know when the text of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill will be before us?
1950-12-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1950-12-12;Food Rationing (Changes);27;Will the right hon. Gentleman bear in mind that a reduction of the meat ration stimulates quite abnormally, the consumption of bread and other forms of food?
1951-11-12-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1951-11-12;Ministry (Change Of Name);12;This is a question of title and not of fact or principle.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);87;We are in frequent consultation with the Governments of Canada, Australia and New Zealand about arrangements affecting the Commonwealth Division. I can make no statement at present about the future of the Division. I hope, however, that as long as the Commonwealth countries are making a contribution in Korea, a Commonwealth formation will be kept in being. If any proposals are made for constituting standing United Nations defence forces, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman has suggested, they will receive careful attention from Her Majesty's Government.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);29;I am obliged to the right hon. and learned Member for drawing attention to what had already been in our minds but now receives more prominence through his exertions.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);14;I do not think there is any difference between us on the general theme.
1954-2-02-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-02;Commonwealth Division, Korea (Future);10;Yes Sir, I am sure that will be carefully considered.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;29;I am looking forward to seeing the hon. and gallant Gentleman make a gesture of which it can be said that it is at any rate not less hollow.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;31;It is not customary to include the staff of any Department or branch in the salary of the Minister. In this case the Minister does not draw any salary at all.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;32;There is absolutely no relationship between the salaries paid to Ministers and the staffs of the various Departments of State which were so grossly and outrageously increased by the right hon. Gentleman.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;23;I think the hon. Member is a judge of cheap demagogic gestures, but they do not often come off when he makes them.
1952-7-29-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-7-29;Ministerial Salaries;21;The right hon. Gentleman is no doubt trying to live up to the cheap demagogic gestures mentioned by his hon. Friend.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;18;Without going into all those important topics, I should not wish to alter the substance of my answer.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;57;The items on the agenda for the 14th Session of this Council, which opened on 20th May, again included the world economic situation, the economic development of underdeveloped countries and a report on measures for international economic stability. I should have thought that that would have included the very critical point mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;21;In any case, I am not proposing to issue invitations for a world economic conference as asked by the hon. Member.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;41;These matters are never out of the minds of Her Majesty's Government, and, indeed, our whole future depends upon them. We are striving our utmost to improve the position from what we found it when the right hon. Gentleman left it.
1952-5-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1952-5-28;World Economic Situation;13;I do not think in the circumstances that I need read it all.
1943-3-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1943-3-24;Questions To Ministers;28;I was consulted on this Question, and it was decided between me and the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it would be appropriate for him to take it.
1940-2-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-07;Shipping Losses (Publication);42;While I fully appreciate the advantages of my hon. Friend's proposal, it is not within the power of the Admiralty to delay publication of such information unless there is a security reason for so doing. Even so publication is often made abroad.
1940-2-07-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1940-2-07;Shipping Losses (Publication);53;Yes, Sir. In regard to His Majesty's ships, we do not publish losses until we have informed the relatives, and I should like to see that practice applicable to the Mercantile Marine, but there is nothing like the same control there, and the possibility of publication abroad must always be borne in mind.
1941-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Mr. Churchill).txt;1941-6-24;German Invasion Of Russia;6;It is a most unfortunate remark.
1941-6-24-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1941-6-24;German Invasion Of Russia;244;I do not rise for the purpose of continuing the Debate on the lines to which it has been turned by the Noble Lord, because I am sure that it would not be at all in the public interest to continue on those lines. I rise rather to hope that the other aspects of the difficult foreign situation may engage the attention of the House and that we should not seek to probe and define too clearly the attitude of certain Powers who, surrounded by very great difficulties, may not wish, or may not be in a position, to declare themselves. All this pressing for a precise answer "Yes" or "No" may sometimes lead to getting an answer contrary to the one you expected, and I am bound to say that I hoped this fairly obvious point would have impressed itself even upon the Noble Lord. These excursions of his into foreign politics, which, I must say, he is less well fitted to discuss than some of the other numerous topics on which he assists us, will not, I trust, be too frequent. I find it very difficult to derive any principle of guidance if no reference is to be made to any country in which the Noble Lord has fought. It would be an altogether undue complication of the liberties of our speech. I trust that we shall drop the topic now, because it really is a case of "least said, soonest mended."
1954-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-2-16;Government Policy (Communications To Foreign Powers);9;I am advised that no such classification is practicable.
1954-2-16-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister.txt;1954-2-16;Government Policy (Communications To Foreign Powers);24;I hope that there will not be too much dismay, because we have gone on for quite a long time without a written Constitution.
1954-7-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Attlee.txt;1954-7-28;Annex 1;97;In view of the fact that we are to have a debate tomorrow, I do not think it would be proper for me to ask many questions, but I should like to  ask one: in view of the statements which were made by the present Prime Minister on the absolute necessity of having troops in Egypt for the defence of the Suez Canal and the violent language which he used when any proposal was put forward from this side of the House for withdrawal from Egypt, may I ask whether this agreement has the Prime Minister's consent?
1954-7-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-The Prime Minister (Sir Winston Churchill).txt;1954-7-28;Annex 1;8;I am convinced that it is absolutely necessary.
1947-1-28-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1947-1-28;Services Marriage Allowance (Men Under 21);14;Can the right hon. Gentleman say what is the estimated expense of this concession?
1949-1-18-Churchill-House of Commons Hansard-Mr. Churchill.txt;1949-1-18;Anglo-Polish Agreement;32;The question asked was whether we are to take it that statements emanating from the Board of Trade are not to be believed? To which I gather the answer is "Yes"—three times.
